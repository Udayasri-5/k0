6818-76332-0009 LOVED MY HUSBAND DEARLY I HATED HIS DEVOTION TO IT WE NEVER AGREED ABOUT THOSE QUESTIONS WHEN MY TWIN BABIES WERE BORN I SECRETLY DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SOUTHERNERS
6818-76332-0010 IN SPIRIT AND ONLY SOUTHERNERS I PLANNED THAT WHEN THEY WERE BOTH OLD ENOUGH THEY SHOULD MARRY IN THE SOUTH AND LIVE THERE AND MY HUSBAND AND I WITH THEM
6818-76332-0011 BUT IN THIS LIFE THINGS SELDOM TURN OUT AS WE PLAN MY LITTLE GIRL DIED BEFORE SHE WAS THREE AND I HAD SCARCELY BECOME RECONCILED TO THIS GRIEF
6818-76332-0012 WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS ALSO TAKEN FROM ME SO I CENTERED ALL MY HOPES ON MY SON ON FAIRFAX AS HE GREW OLDER HOWEVER AND AS THE CIVIL WAR CAME NEARER
6818-76332-0013 I NOTICED THAT HE TALKED MORE AND MORE IN SYMPATHY WITH THE NORTH AND THIS DISTRESSED ME TERRIBLY HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT BEST NOT TO SAY MUCH ABOUT IT TO HIM FOR HE WAS A HEADSTRONG BOY
6818-76332-0014 AND HAD ALWAYS RESENTED OPPOSITION AND I FELT SURE THAT HE WOULD SEE THINGS DIFFERENTLY WHEN HE WAS OLDER I WISHED TO SEND HIM TO A SOUTHERN COLLEGE BUT HE BEGGED ME TO SEND HIM TO HARVARD
6818-76332-0015 AS HIS HEART WAS SO SET ON IT I COULDN'T DENY HIM THINKING THAT EVEN THIS WOULD MAKE LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE END THEN CAME THE CRISIS IN THE COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS
6818-76332-0016 AND THE CONFEDERACY WAS DECLARED I HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO CORRESPOND WITH SOUTHERN AUTHORITIES TO ARRANGE ABOUT RAISING A COMPANY FOR FAIRFAX I NEVER DOUBTED THAT HE WOULD COMPLY WITH MY WISHES BUT
6818-76332-0017 I LITTLE KNEW HIM I HARDLY NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE AWFUL DAY THAT HE CAME HOME YOU ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THE HISTORY OF IT THAT AFTERNOON SHORTLY AFTER HE ARRIVED
6818-76332-0018 WE HAD OUR INTERVIEW I HAVE ALWAYS POSSESSED THE MOST VIOLENT TEMPER A MORTAL HAD TO STRUGGLE WITH AND IN THOSE EARLIER YEARS WHEN I GOT INTO A RAGE IT BLINDED ME TO EVERYTHING ELSE
6818-76332-0019 TO EVERY OTHER EARTHLY CONSIDERATION AND DURING THAT INTERVIEW WELL NEED I SAY IT FAIRFAX WAS SIMPLY IMMOVABLE GENTLE AND LOVING ALWAYS
6818-76332-0020 BUT I COULD NO MORE IMPRESS HIM WITH MY WISHES THAN I COULD HAVE MOVED THE ROCK OF GIBRALTAR THE GALLING PART TO ME WAS THAT HE KEPT INSISTING HE WAS ONLY DOING WHAT WAS RIGHT RIGHT
6818-76332-0021 HOW COULD HE BE RIGHT WHEN IT WAS ALL DIRECTLY CONTRARY BUT NEVER MIND THAT NOW I HAVE LEARNED DIFFERENTLY WITH THE PASSING SORROWFUL YEARS BUT TO GO BACK
6818-76332-0022 I STOOD IT AS LONG AS I COULD AND THEN I TURNED FROM HIM DISOWNED HIM BADE HIM LEAVE THE HOUSE AT ONCE AND NEVER SEE MY FACE AGAIN AND INFORMED HIM THAT I MYSELF WOULD ABANDON THE PLACE ON THE MORROW
6818-76332-0023 AND RETURN TO THE SOUTH HE LEFT ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD AND WENT TO HIS ROOM I IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED THE SERVANTS AND DISMISSED THEM ON THE SPOT GIVING THEM ONLY TIME TO GET THEIR THINGS TOGETHER AND GO
6818-76332-0024 THEN I LOCKED MYSELF IN MY ROOM TILL HE WAS GONE HE CAME SEVERAL TIMES KNOCKED AT MY DOOR AND BEGGED ME TO SEE HIM BUT I WOULD NOT
6818-76332-0025 HEAVEN FORGIVE ME I WOULD NOT SO HE MUST HAVE LEFT ME THAT NOTE SHE COVERED HER EYES WITH HER HAND A MOMENT THEN SHE WENT ON
6818-76332-0026 I NEVER SAW OR KNEW OF IT TILL THIS DAY IF I HAD JUST AT THIS POINT THEY WERE ALL STARTLED BY A LOUD KNOCK COMING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE FRONT DOOR
6818-76332-0027 SO UNEXPECTED WAS THE SOUND THAT THEY COULD ONLY STARE AT EACH OTHER INQUIRINGLY WITHOUT STIRRING IN A MOMENT IT CAME AGAIN A THUMPING OF THE OLD KNOCKER ON THE FRONT INNER DOOR
6818-76332-0028 I GUESS I'D BETTER GO SAID JOYCE SOME ONE MAY HAVE SEEN THE LITTLE BOARDED UP DOOR OPEN DID YOU LEAVE IT OPEN SHE ASKED TURNING TO MISSUS COLLINGWOOD I THINK I DID
6818-76332-0029 I WAS TOO HURRIED AND NERVOUS WHEN I CAME IN TO THINK OF IT THAT'S IT THEN SOME ONE HAS SEEN IT OPEN AND HAS STOPPED TO INQUIRE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT SHE HURRIED AWAY TO THE FRONT DOOR
6818-76332-0030 AND AFTER AN EFFORT SUCCEEDED IN PULLING IT OPEN A MAN A COMPLETE STRANGER TO HER STOOD OUTSIDE THEY REGARDED EACH OTHER WITH MUTUAL SURPRISE PARDON ME HE SAID
6818-76332-0031 BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN INFORM ME IS ANY ONE LIVING IN THIS HOUSE AT PRESENT WHY NO REPLIED JOYCE RATHER CONFUSEDLY THAT IS NO THE HOUSE IS EMPTY EXCEPT JUST JUST TO DAY
6818-76332-0032 OH ER I SEE THE FACT IS THE STRANGER WENT ON I WAS PASSING HERE AND NOTICED THIS OUTER DOOR OPEN WHICH SEEMED A LITTLE QUEER I USED TO KNOW THE PEOPLE WHO LIVED HERE VERY WELL INDEED
6818-76332-0033 AND I HAVE BEEN WONDERING WHETHER THE HOUSE WAS STILL IN THEIR POSSESSION IT SEEMED TO BE UNTENANTED AT HIS MENTION OF KNOWING THE FAMILY JOYCE LOOKED HIM OVER WITH CONSIDERABLY MORE INTEREST HE WAS TALL STRAIGHT AND ROBUST
6818-76332-0034 THOUGH RATHER VERGING ON THE ELDERLY HIS IRON GRAY HAIR WAS CRISPLY CURLY AND HIS DARK EYES TWINKLED OUT FROM UNDER BUSHY GRAY BROWS HIS SMILE WAS CAPTIVATING
6818-76332-0035 JOYCE DECIDED AT ONCE THAT SHE LIKED HIM OH DID YOU KNOW THE FAMILY THE THE COLLINGWOODS HE SUPPLEMENTED WITH HIS TWINKLING SMILE YES I KNEW THEM QUITE INTIMATELY
6818-76332-0036 MIGHT I PERHAPS IF IT WOULD NOT BE INTRUDING COME IN JUST A MOMENT TO LOOK ONCE MORE AT THE OLD PLACE THAT IS HE ADDED HASTILY SEEING HER HESITATE ONLY IF IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY CONVENIENT
6818-76332-0037 I DO NOT KNOW OF COURSE WHY THE HOUSE IS OPEN PERHAPS PEOPLE ARE ARE ABOUT TO PURCHASE IT JOYCE WAS FOR A MOMENT TONGUE TIED WITH PERPLEXITY SHE HATED TO REFUSE THE SIMPLE WISH OF THIS PLEASANT STRANGER
6818-76332-0038 YET HOW WAS SHE TO COMPLY WITH IT CONSIDERING THE PRESENCE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD AND THE ALMOST UNEXPLAINABLE POSITION OF HERSELF AND CYNTHIA WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF IT ALL WHILE SHE WAS HESITATING AN IDEA CAME TO HER
6818-76332-0039 THERE IS ONE OF THE FAMILY HERE TO DAY ON ON BUSINESS SHE SAID AT LAST IF YOU WILL GIVE ME YOUR NAME I WILL ASK IF THAT PERSON WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU OH THAT IS HARDLY WORTH WHILE
6818-76332-0040 MY NAME IS CALTHORPE BUT I'M SURE THEY WOULDN'T REMEMBER ME AFTER ALL THIS TIME AND I DO NOT WISH TO TROUBLE THEM BUT JOYCE HAD EXCUSED HERSELF AND TURNED AWAY AS SOON AS SHE HEARD THE NAME LEAVING HIM STANDING THERE
6818-76332-0041 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD HOWEVER SHOOK HER HEAD WHEN JOYCE ANNOUNCED WHO WAS OUTSIDE I DO NOT REMEMBER ANY ONE NAMED CALTHORPE AND I SCARCELY FEEL THAT I CAN SEE A STRANGER NOW
6818-76332-0042 BUT WE MUST NOT BE INHOSPITABLE MISS CYNTHIA AND I WILL GO AND SIT IN THE LIBRARY AND YOU CAN BRING HIM INTO THE DRAWING ROOM A FEW MOMENTS THERE IS NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSE THAT CAN VERY WELL BE SHOWN
6818-76332-0043 SHE TOOK CYNTHIA'S ARM WALKED INTO THE LIBRARY AND PARTLY CLOSED THE DOOR WHILE JOYCE WENT OUT TO ADMIT THE STRANGER IF YOU CARE TO LOOK AROUND THE DRAWING ROOM YOU WILL BE MOST WELCOME SHE ANNOUNCED POLITELY
6818-76332-0044 HE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION GRATEFULLY AND ENTERED WITH HER AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOWEVER HE STARTED BACK SLIGHTLY AS WITH A SHOCK OF SURPRISE WHY HOW STRANGE HOW VERY SINGULAR HE MURMURED
6818-76332-0045 THESE CANDLES EVERYTHING EVERYTHING JUST THE SAME AS THOUGH IT WERE YESTERDAY DID YOU OFTEN COME HERE INQUIRED JOYCE YOU MUST BE VERY WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE HOUSE
6818-76332-0046 YES I CAME OFTEN I WAS ALMOST LIKE AN INMATE HE BEGAN TO WANDER SLOWLY ABOUT THE ROOM EXAMINING THE PICTURES IN FRONT OF THE BABY TWINS HE PAUSED A LONG TIME
6818-76332-0047 THEN YOU MUST HAVE KNOWN YOUNG MISTER FAIRFAX VERY WELL SUGGESTED JOYCE THAT'S HE ON THE RIGHT IN THE PICTURE THE STRANGER EYED HER CURIOUSLY WHY YES I KNEW HIM WELL
6818-76332-0048 BUT YOU LITTLE LADY SEEM QUITE INTIMATE WITH THE COLLINGWOOD FAMILY HISTORY TELL ME ARE YOU A A RELATIVE THIS CONFUSED JOYCE ANEW
6818-76332-0049 BUT I HAVE BEEN TOLD A GOOD DEAL ABOUT THEM AN UNHAPPY FAMILY WAS HIS ONLY COMMENT AND HE CONTINUED HIS TOUR AROUND THE ROOM
6818-76332-0050 IN FRONT OF THE OLD SQUARE OPEN PIANO HE PAUSED AGAIN AND FINGERED THE SILK SCARF THAT HAD AT SOME LONG AGO DATE BEEN THROWN CARELESSLY UPON IT THEN HE RAN HIS FINGERS LIGHTLY OVER THE YELLOW KEYS
6818-76332-0051 THE TONES WERE UNBELIEVABLY JANGLING AND DISCORDANT YET JOYCE THOUGHT SHE CAUGHT THE NOTES OF A LITTLE TUNE AND IN ANOTHER MOMENT HE BROKE INTO THE AIR SINGING SOFTLY THE OPENING LINE
6818-76332-0052 HE HAD SUNG NO MORE WHEN THE FACE OF MISSUS COLLINGWOOD APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY HER EYES WERE WIDE AND STARING HER FEATURES ALMOST GRAY IN COLOR
6818-76332-0053 WHO WHO ARE YOU SHE DEMANDED IN A VOICE SCARCELY LOUDER THAN A WHISPER THE STRANGER GAZED AT HER WITH A FIXED LOOK ARTHUR
6818-76332-0054 ARTHUR CALTHORPE HE FALTERED NO YOU ARE NOT THEY DREW TOWARD EACH OTHER UNCONSCIOUSLY AS THOUGH MOVING IN A DREAM NO ONE
6818-76332-0055 MISSUS COLLINGWOOD CAME CLOSER AND UTTERED A SUDDEN LOW CRY MY SON MOTHER THE TWO GIRLS WHO HAD BEEN WATCHING THIS SCENE WITH AMAZEMENT UNUTTERABLE
6818-76332-0056 THEN WITH A BEAUTIFUL GESTURE THE MAN HELD OUT HIS ARMS AND THE WOMAN WITH A LITTLE GASP OF HAPPINESS
6836-61803-0000 IT IS NOW EVENING AND THE SUNBEAMS FALLING ASLANT INTRUDE UPON THE SPACE CANOPIED BY THE TREE FROM THE GOLDEN BRIGHTNESS DISPLAYED BY THEM AT NOON
6836-61803-0001 AS IF THERE WAS ANGER IN THE SKY IT IS BUT AN ACCIDENT OF THE ATMOSPHERE THE PORTENT OF AN APPROACHING STORM
6836-61803-0002 FOR ALL THIS IT IS REMARKED AS SINGULAR THAT A STORM SHOULD BE COMING AT THE TIME SINCE IT SYMBOLISES THE SENTIMENT OF THE SPECTATORS WHO LOOK ON WITH SULLENNESS IN THEIR HEARTS AND GLOOM IN THEIR GLANCES
6836-61803-0003 IT WOULD SEEM AS IF HEAVEN'S WRATH WAS ACTING IN CONCERT WITH THE PASSIONS OF EARTH MAURICE GERALD IS NO LONGER THE CYNOSURE OF THOSE SCOWLING EYES HE HAS BEEN CLAMOROUSLY ACQUITTED
6836-61803-0004 AND IS HENCEFORTH ONLY ONE OF THE WITNESSES IN THE PLACE LATE OCCUPIED BY HIM ANOTHER STANDS CASSIUS CALHOUN IS NOW THE PRISONER AT THE BAR
6836-61803-0005 THIS IS THE ONLY CHANGE OBSERVABLE THE JUDGE IS THE SAME THE JURY THE SAME AND THE SPECTATORS AS BEFORE THOUGH WITH VERY DIFFERENT FEELINGS IN REGARD TO THE CRIMINALITY OF THE ACCUSED
6836-61803-0006 IT HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND THE SHADOW OF A DOUBT THE EVIDENCE IS ALREADY BEFORE THEM AND THOUGH ENTIRELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL AS IN MOST CASES OF MURDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES FORM A CHAIN IRRESISTIBLY CONCLUSIVE AND COMPLETE
6836-61803-0007 THERE IS BUT ONE MISSING LINK IF LINK IT MAY BE CALLED THE MOTIVE THE MOTIVE BOTH FOR THE MURDER AND THE MUTILATION
6836-61803-0008 FOR THE TESTIMONY OF GERALD HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BY A SUBSEQUENT EXAMINATION OF THE DEAD BODY THE SURGEON OF THE CANTONMENT HAS PRONOUNCED THE TWO DISTINCT AND THAT HENRY POINDEXTER'S DEATH
6836-61803-0009 MUST HAVE ENSUED ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY AFTER HIS RECEIVING THE SHOT WHY SHOULD CASSIUS CALHOUN HAVE KILLED HIS OWN COUSIN WHY CUT OFF HIS HEAD NO ONE CAN ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS
6836-61803-0010 SAVE THE MURDERER HIMSELF NO ONE EXPECTS HIM TO DO SO SAVE TO HIS MAKER BEFORE HIM HE MUST SOON STAND FOR A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOTIVE IS NOT DEEMED ESSENTIAL TO HIS CONDEMNATION
6836-61803-0011 AND HE HAS BEEN CONDEMNED THE TRIAL HAS COME TO A CLOSE THE VERDICT GUILTY HAS BEEN GIVEN AND THE JUDGE LAYING ASIDE HIS PANAMA HAT IS ABOUT TO PUT ON THE BLACK CAP
6836-61803-0012 THAT DREAD EMBLEM OF DEATH PREPARATORY TO PRONOUNCING THE SENTENCE IN THE USUAL SOLEMN MANNER THE CONDEMNED MAN IS INVITED TO MAKE HIS FINAL SPEECH TO AVAIL HIMSELF AS IT WERE
6836-61803-0013 HE STARTS AT THE INVITATION FALLING AS IT DOES LIKE A DEATH KNELL UPON HIS EAR HE LOOKS WILDLY AROUND DESPAIRINGLY
6836-61803-0014 WHEN ON THE FACES THAT ENCIRCLE HIM HE SEES NOT ONE WEARING AN EXPRESSION OF SYMPATHY THERE IS NOT EVEN PITY ALL APPEAR TO FROWN UPON HIM
6836-61803-0015 HIS CONFEDERATES THOSE PAYED RUFFIANS WHO HAVE HITHERTO SUPPORTED HIM ARE OF NO USE NOW AND THEIR SYMPATHY OF NO CONSEQUENCE THEY HAVE SHRUNK OUT OF SIGHT
6836-61803-0016 BEFORE THE MAJESTY OF THE LAW AND THE DAMNING EVIDENCE OF HIS GUILT DESPITE HIS SOCIAL STANDING AND THE WEALTH TO SUSTAIN IT HE SEES HIMSELF ALONE WITHOUT FRIEND OR SYMPATHISER
6836-61803-0017 FOR SO STANDS THE ASSASSIN IN TEXAS HIS DEMEANOUR IS COMPLETELY CHANGED
6836-61803-0018 OFT EXHIBITED IN BOLD BRUTAL BULLYISM HE LOOKS COWED AND CRAVEN AND NOT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD HE FEELS THAT THERE IS NO CHANCE OF ESCAPE THAT HE IS STANDING BY THE SIDE OF HIS COFFIN
6836-61803-0019 ON THE EDGE OF AN ETERNITY TOO TERRIBLE TO CONTEMPLATE TO A CONSCIENCE LIKE HIS IT CANNOT BE OTHERWISE THAN APPALLING ALL AT ONCE A LIGHT IS SEEN TO FLASK INTO HIS EYES
6836-61803-0020 SUNKEN AS THEY ARE IN THE MIDST OF TWO LIVID CIRCLES HE HAS THE AIR OF ONE ON THE EVE OF MAKING CONFESSION IS IT TO BE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GUILT
6836-61803-0021 IS HE ABOUT TO UNBURDEN HIS CONSCIENCE OF THE WEIGHT THAT MUST BE ON IT THE SPECTATORS GUESSING HIS INTENTION STAND BREATHLESSLY OBSERVING HIM THERE IS SILENCE EVEN AMONG THE CICADAS
6836-61803-0022 IT IS BROKEN BY THE FORMALISED INTERROGATORY OF THE JUDGE HAVE YOU ANYTHING TO SAY WHY SENTENCE OF DEATH SHOULD NOT BE PRONOUNCED UPON YOU NO HE REPLIES I HAVE NOT
6836-61803-0023 THE JURY HAS GIVEN A JUST VERDICT I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE FORFEITED MY LIFE AND DESERVE TO LOSE IT
6836-61803-0024 SHOT HIM DEAD IN THE CHAPPARAL
6836-61803-0025 AND EXPRESSES HORROR RATHER THAN INDIGNATION ALIKE INVOLUNTARY IS THE GROAN THAT GOES WITH IT PROCEEDING FROM A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL WHOM ALL KNOW TO BE THE FATHER OF THE MURDERED MAN
6836-61803-0026 ONCE MORE IN THEIR MIDST BEYOND THESE SOUNDS SOON CEASING THERE IS NOTHING TO HINDER THE CONFESSION FROM BEING CONTINUED I KNOW THAT I'VE GOT TO DIE PROCEEDS THE PRISONER WITH AN AIR OF SEEMING RECKLESSNESS
6836-61803-0027 AFTER WHAT I'VE CONFESSED IT WOULD BE FOLLY IN ME TO EXPECT PARDON AND I DON'T I'VE BEEN A BAD FELLOW AND NO DOUBT HAVE DONE ENOUGH TO DESERVE MY FATE BUT BAD AS I MAY HAVE BEEN
6836-61803-0028 IMPUTATION OF HAVING MURDERED MY OWN COUSIN I DID TAKE HIS LIFE AS I'VE TOLD YOU YOU ARE ALL ASKING WHY AND CONJECTURING ABOUT THE MOTIVE THERE WAS NONE
6836-61803-0029 A NEW SENSATION MAKES ITSELF MANIFEST AMONG THE SPECTATORS IT PARTAKES OF SURPRISE CURIOSITY AND INCREDULITY NO ONE SPEAKS OR IN ANY WAY ATTEMPTS INTERRUPTION
6836-61803-0030 YOU WONDER AT THAT IT'S EASILY EXPLAINED I KILLED HIM BY MISTAKE THE SURPRISE CULMINATES IN A SHOUT SUPPRESSED AS THE SPEAKER PROCEEDS YES BY MISTAKE
6836-61803-0031 AND GOD KNOWS I WAS SORRY ENOUGH ON DISCOVERING THAT I HAD MADE IT I DIDN'T KNOW MYSELF TILL LONG AFTER THE CONDEMNED MAN LOOKS UP AS IF IN HOPES THAT HE HAS TOUCHED A CHORD OF MERCY
6836-61803-0032 THERE IS NO SIGN OF IT ON THE FACES THAT SURROUND HIM STILL SOLEMNLY AUSTERE
6836-61803-0033 CONTINUES HE I NEEDN'T THAT I INTENDED TO KILL SOME ONE I DID NOR AM I GOING TO DENY WHO IT WAS IT WAS THE CUR I SEE STANDING BEFORE ME IN A GLANCE OF CONCENTRATED HATRED
6836-61803-0034 THE SPEAKER RESTS HIS EYE
6836-61803-0035 WHO ONLY ANSWERS WITH A LOOK SO CALM AS ALMOST TO BETRAY INDIFFERENCE YES I INTENDED TO KILL HIM I HAD MY REASONS I'M NOT GOING TO SAY WHAT THEY WERE IT'S NO USE NOW
6836-61803-0036 AND FATAL TO A FRIEND IT WAS SURE ENOUGH AND POOR HENRY DROPPED FROM HIS HORSE
6836-61803-0037 EITHER ABOUT THE MURDER OR ITS MOTIVE AND THE PRISONER IS SPARED FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THAT FIENDISH DEED THAT LEFT THE DEAD BODY OF HENRY POINDEXTER WITHOUT A HEAD
6836-61803-0038 YOU KNOW ALL THAT'S PASSED BUT NOT WHAT'S TO COME
6836-61803-0039 YOU SEE ME STANDING ON MY GRAVE
6836-61803-0040 TILL I'VE SENT HIM TO HIS I DON'T BY GOD THERE IS NO NEED TO GUESS AT THE MEANING OF THIS PROFANE SPEECH THE LAST OF CALHOUN'S LIFE ITS MEANING IS MADE CLEAR BY THE ACT THAT ACCOMPANIES IT
6836-61803-0041 WHILE SPEAKING HE HAS KEPT HIS RIGHT HAND UNDER THE LEFT BREAST OF HIS COAT ALONG WITH THE OATH IT COMES FORTH HOLDING A REVOLVER THE SPECTATORS HAVE JUST TIME TO SEE THE PISTOL
6836-61803-0042 AS IT GLINTS UNDER THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS WHEN TWO SHOTS ARE HEARD IN QUICK SUCCESSION WITH A LIKE INTERVAL BETWEEN TWO MEN FALL FORWARD UPON THEIR FACES AND LIE WITH THEIR HEADS CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS
6836-61803-0043 THE CROWD CLOSES AROUND BELIEVING BOTH TO BE DEAD
6836-61804-0000 WHO CAN BLAME HER FOR GIVING WAY TO THE SUBDUED HAPPINESS THAT SUCCEEDED NOT I NOT YOU IF YOU SPEAK TRULY THE PASSION THAT CONTROLLED HER MAY NOT BE POPULAR UNDER A STRICTLY PURITAN STANDARD
6836-61804-0001 UNIVERSAL AND IRRESISTIBLE TELLING US THAT FATHER MOTHER SISTER AND BROTHER ARE ALL TO BE FORSAKEN FOR THAT LOVE ILLIMITABLE
6836-61804-0002 DO NOT REPROACH THE YOUNG CREOLE BECAUSE THIS PASSION WAS PARAMOUNT IN HER SOUL DO NOT BLAME HER FOR FEELING PLEASURE AMIDST MOMENTS THAT SHOULD OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO SADNESS
6836-61804-0003 NOR THAT HER HAPPINESS WAS HEIGHTENED ON LEARNING FROM THE ASTONISHED SPECTATORS HOW HER LOVER'S LIFE HAD BEEN PRESERVED AS IT MIGHT SEEM MIRACULOUSLY THE AIM OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0004 HAD BEEN TRUE ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE FELT SURE OF IT BEFORE TURNING THE MUZZLE TOWARDS HIS OWN TEMPLES AND FIRING THE BULLET THAT HAD LODGED IN HIS BRAIN
6836-61804-0005 RIGHT OVER THE HEART HE HAD HIT HIS INTENDED VICTIM AND THROUGH THE HEART WOULD THE LEADEN MISSILE HAVE MADE ITS WAY
6836-61804-0006 THE GIFT OF HER WHO ALONE COULD HAVE SECURED IT SUCH A PLACE TURNED ASIDE THE SHOT CAUSING IT TO RICOCHET NOT HARMLESSLY HOWEVER
6836-61804-0007 WITH THE MENTAL AND CORPOREAL EXCITEMENT LONG SUSTAINED DID NOT FAIL TO PRODUCE ITS EFFECT AND THE MIND OF MAURICE GERALD ONCE MORE RETURNED TO ITS DELIRIOUS DREAMING
6836-61804-0008 BUT NO LONGER LAY HIS BODY IN DANGER IN THE CHAPPARAL SURROUNDED BY WOLVES AND SHADOWED BY SOARING VULTURES IN A HUT WHERE HE WAS BUT ILL ATTENDED
6836-61804-0009 IN A JAIL WHERE HE WAS SCARCE CARED FOR AT ALL WHEN AGAIN RESTORED TO CONSCIOUSNESS IT WAS TO DISCOVER THAT THE FAIR VISION OF HIS DREAMS WAS NO VISION AT ALL BUT A LOVELY WOMAN
6836-61804-0010 THE SPIRIT OF THE ARISTOCRATIC PLANTER STEEPED IN SORROW AND HUMILIATED BY MISFORTUNE HAD BECOME PURGED OF ITS FALSE PRIDE THOUGH IT NEEDED NOT THIS TO MAKE HIM WILLINGLY ACQUIESCE IN AN ALLIANCE
6836-61804-0011 WHICH INSTEAD OF A NOBODY GAVE HIM A NOBLEMAN FOR HIS SON SUCH IN REALITY WAS SIR MAURICE GERALD ERST KNOWN AS MAURICE THE MUSTANGER IN TEXAS
6836-61804-0012 THE TITLE WOULD HAVE COUNTED FOR LITTLE NOR DID ITS OWNER CARE TO CARRY IT BUT BY A BIT OF GOOD FORTUNE NOT ALWAYS ATTENDANT ON AN IRISH BARONETCY
6836-61804-0013 IT CARRIED ALONG WITH IT AN ENDOWMENT AMPLE ENOUGH TO CLEAR CASA DEL CORVO OF THE MORTGAGE HELD BY THE LATE CASSIUS CALHOUN AND CLAIMED BY HIS NEAREST OF KIN THIS WAS NOT WOODLEY POINDEXTER
6836-61804-0014 FOR AFTER CALHOUN'S DEATH IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE EX CAPTAIN HAD ONCE BEEN A BENEDICT AND THERE WAS A YOUNG SCION OF HIS STOCK LIVING IN NEW ORLEANS WHO HAD THE LEGAL RIGHT TO SAY HE WAS HIS SON
6836-61804-0015 IT MATTERED NOT TO MAURICE GERALD WHO NOW CLEAR OF EVERY ENTANGLEMENT BECAME THE HUSBAND OF THE FAIR CREOLE AFTER A VISIT TO HIS NATIVE LAND INCLUDING THE EUROPEAN TOUR
6836-61804-0016 LOUISE POINDEXTER LADY GERALD SHE MUST NOW BE CALLED DURING HER SOJOURN IN THE EMERALD ISLE SAW NOTHING TO EXCITE HER TO JEALOUSY ONLY ONCE AGAIN DID THIS FELL PASSION
6836-61804-0017 TAKE POSSESSION OF HER SPIRIT AND THEN ONLY IN THE SHAPE OF A SHADOW SOON TO PASS AWAY IT WAS ONE DAY WHEN HER HUSBAND CAME HOME TO THE HACIENDA BEARING IN HIS ARMS THE BODY OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN
6836-61804-0018 NOT YET DEAD THOUGH THE BLOOD STREAMING FROM A WOUND IN HER BARED BOSOM SHOWED SHE HAD NOT LONG TO LIVE TO THE QUESTION WHO HAS DONE THIS SHE WAS ONLY ABLE TO ANSWER DIAZ
6836-61804-0019 DIAZ IT WAS THE LAST UTTERANCE OF
6836-61804-0020 COVARUBIO DE LOS LLANOS AS THE SPIRIT OF THE UNHAPPY SENORITA PASSED INTO ETERNITY
6836-61804-0021 WHOSE STORY SHE NOW BETTER COMPREHENDED SHE EVEN ASSISTED HER LORD IN THE SADDLING OF HIS RED BAY STEED AND ENCOURAGED HIM IN THE PURSUIT OF THE ASSASSIN
6836-61804-0022 SHE JOYED TO SEE THE LATTER LED BACK AT THE END OF A LAZO HELD IN THE HAND OF HER HUSBAND AND REFUSED TO INTERFERE WHEN A BAND OF REGULATORS CALLED HASTILY TOGETHER
6836-61804-0023 DEALT OUT SUMMARY CHASTISEMENT BY HANGING HIM TO A TREE IT WAS NOT CRUELTY ONLY A CRUDE KIND OF JUSTICE AN EYE FOR AN EYE AND A TOOTH FOR A TOOTH
6836-61804-0024 AND WHAT A POOR COMPENSATION IT SEEMED TO THOSE WHO HAD TAKEN PART IN EXACTING IT AS THEY STOOD GAZING UPON THE REMAINS OF THE VILLAIN AND HIS VICTIM THE SWARTH RUFFIAN DANGLING FROM THE BRANCH ABOVE
6836-61804-0025 AND THE FAIR FORM LYING UNDERNEATH THE HEARTS OF THE TEXANS WERE TOUCHED AS PERHAPS THEY HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE THERE WAS A STRANGE THOUGHT PASSING THROUGH THEIR MINDS
6836-61804-0026 A SADNESS INDEPENDENT OF THAT CAUSED BY THE SPECTACLE OF A MURDER IT WAS REGRET AT HAVING SO HASTILY DESPATCHED THE ASSASSIN BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN DEATH WAS ISIDORA SUCH FEATURES AS SHE POSSESSED
6836-61804-0027 AT LENGTH GOING WITH THOUGHTS NOT ALTOGETHER SACRED IN THE PHYSICAL WORLD TIME IS ACCOUNTED THE DESTROYER THOUGH IN THE MORAL IT IS OFT THE RESTORER
6836-61804-0028 NOWHERE HAS IT EFFECTED GREATER CHANGES THAN IN TEXAS DURING THE LAST DECADE AND ESPECIALLY
6836-61804-0029 PLANTATIONS HAVE SPRUNG UP WHERE LATE THE CHAPPARAL THICKLY COVERED THE EARTH AND CITIES STAND WHERE THE WILD STEED ONCE ROAMED OVER A PATHLESS PRAIRIE
6836-61804-0030 YOU WOULD BECOME THE RECIPIENT OF A HOSPITALITY UNEQUALLED IN EUROPEAN LANDS YOU WOULD HAVE FOR YOUR HOST ONE OF THE HANDSOMEST MEN IN TEXAS FOR YOUR HOSTESS ONE OF ITS MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMEN
6836-61804-0031 BOTH STILL THIS SIDE OF MIDDLE LIFE RESIDING UNDER THEIR ROOF YOU WOULD FIND AN OLD GENTLEMAN OF ARISTOCRATIC AIR AND VENERABLE ASPECT WITHAL CHATTY AND CHEERFUL WHO WOULD CONDUCT YOU AROUND THE CORRALES
6836-61804-0032 SHOW YOU THE STOCK AND NEVER TIRE OF TALKING ABOUT THE HUNDREDS AY THOUSANDS OF HORSES AND HORNED CATTLE SEEN ROAMING OVER THE PASTURES OF THE PLANTATION
6836-61804-0033 LEAVING HIM FOR A TIME YOU WOULD COME IN CONTACT WITH TWO OTHER INDIVIDUALS ATTACHED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT ONE IS THE GROOM OF THE STOLE BY NAME PHELIM O'NEAL
6836-61804-0034 WHO HAS FULL CHARGE OF THE HORSES THE OTHER A COACHMAN OF SABLE SKIN YCLEPT PLUTO POINDEXTER WHO WOULD SCORN TO LOOK AT A HORSE EXCEPT WHEN PERCHED UPON THE BOX
6836-61804-0035 AND AFTER HAVING THE RIBBONS DEFTLY DELIVERED INTO HIS HANDS SINCE WE LAST SAW HIM THE GAY PLUTO HAS BECOME TAMED DOWN TO A STAID AND SOBER BENEDICT BLACK THOUGH HE BE
6836-61804-0036 FLORINDA NOW THE BETTER HALF OF HIS LIFE HAS EFFECTED THE TRANSFORMATION
6836-61804-0037 AND BACK ONLY AFTER YOU HAVE RETIRED BUT THE HUGE GOBBLER SEEN IN THE SMOKE HOUSE
6836-61804-0038 THE DOMESTICS WILL TELL IT YOU BUT ONLY IN WHISPERS SINCE THEY KNOW THAT IT IS A THEME TABOOED BY THE MASTER AND MISTRESS OF THE MANSION IN WHOM IT EXCITES SAD SOUVENIRS IT IS THE STORY

6836-76549-0003 BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE CONSIDERABLE PRIDE OF LOCALITY IN THE GREAT HOOSIER STATE AND I VENTURE THERE ARE SCORES OF PRETTIEST TOWNS IN INDIANA NEVERTHELESS GOSHEN IS CERTAINLY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE WITH UNUSUALLY BROAD WELL SHADED STREETS
6836-76549-0004 HAS HAD AN EXTRA STOUT BONE SHAKER MADE TO ORDER
6836-76549-0005 WHO BEING ABOUT FIFTY PER CENT LESS BULKY RIDE REGULATION WHEELS JUMBO GOES ALL RIGHT WHEN MOUNTED BUT BEING UNABLE TO MOUNT WITHOUT AID HE SELDOM VENTURES ABROAD BY HIMSELF FOR FEAR OF HAVING TO FOOT IT BACK

6848-252323-0013 BILLY AT THE SAME MOMENT TOOK OUT HIS FIDDLE AND BEGAN THAT PROCESS OF PREPARATORY SCREWING AND SCRAPING WHICH NO MATTER HOW DISTRESSING TO THE SURROUNDERS SEEMS TO AFFORD INTENSE DELIGHT TO PERFORMERS ON THIS INSTRUMENT IN THE PRESENT CASE
6848-252323-0014 IT IS BUT FAIR TO SAY THERE WAS NEITHER COMMENT NOR IMPATIENCE ON THE CONTRARY THEY SEEMED TO ACCEPT THESE CONVULSIVE THROES OF SOUND AS AN EARNEST OF THE GRAND FLOOD OF MELODY THAT WAS COMING

6848-252323-0023 CHEAP PENKNIVES AND SCISSORS PENCIL CASES BODKINS AND THE LIKE AND I WANDERED ABOUT FOR WEEKS THROUGH WHAT THEY CALL THE LAKE COUNTRY A VERY HANDSOME PLACE
6848-252323-0024 LIKE WHAT WE HAVE HERE IN IRELAND MORE WOOD FOREST TIMBER AND BETTER OFF PEOPLE BUT NOTHING BEYOND THAT WELL ONE EVENING IT WAS IN AUGUST I CAME DOWN BY A NARROW PATH TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE WHERE THERE WAS A STONE SEAT
6848-252323-0025 RUNNING OUT INTO THE LAKE AND THERE WAS TWO ISLANDS ALL WOODED TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND BEHIND ALL IN THE DISTANCE WAS A GREAT MOUNTAIN WITH CLOUDS ON THE TOP AND IT WAS JUST THE SEASON WHEN THE TREES IS BEGINNIN TO CHANGE THEIR COLORS
6848-252323-0026 AND I STRETCHED MYSELF DOWN AT THE WATER'S EDGE AND I FELL INTO A FIT OF MUSING IT'S OFTEN AND OFTEN I TRIED TO REMEMBER THE ELEGANT FANCIES THAT CAME THROUGH MY HEAD AND THE BEAUTIFUL THINGS THAT I THOUGHT I SAW THAT NIGHT OUT ON THE LAKE FORNINT ME
6848-252323-0027 YE SEE I WAS FRESH AND FASTIN I NEVER TASTED A BIT THE WHOLE DAY AND MY BRAIN MAYBE WAS ALL THE BETTER FOR SOMEHOW JANIUS REAL JANIUS THRIVES BEST ON A LITTLE STARVATION AND FROM MUSING
6848-252323-0028 AND BLENDED IN WITH THE SLIGHT SPLASH OF OARS THAT MOVED THROUGH THE WATER CAREFULLY AS THOUGH NOT TO LOSE A WORD OF HIM THAT WAS SPEAKIN IT'S CLEAN BEYOND ME TO TELL YOU WHAT HE SAID AND MAYBE IF I COULD
6848-252323-0029 FOR HE WAS DISCOORSIN ABOUT NIGHT AND THE MOON AND ALL THAT VARIOUS POETS SAID ABOUT THEM YE'D THINK THAT HE HAD BOOKS AND WAS READING OUT OF THEM SO GLIBLY CAME THE VERSES FROM HIS LIPS I NEVER LISTENED TO SUCH A VOICE BEFORE SO SOFT SO SWEET
6848-252323-0030 SO MUSICAL AND THE WORDS CAME DROPPIN DOWN LIKE THE CLEAR WATER FILTERIN OVER A ROCKY LEDGE AND GLITTERIN LIKE LITTLE SPANGLES OVER MOSS AND WILD FLOWERS IT WASN'T ONLY IN ENGLISH BUT SCOTCH BALLADS TOO AND ONCE OR TWICE IN ITALIAN THAT HE RECITED
6848-252323-0031 TILL AT LAST HE GAVE OUT IN ALL THE FULNESS OF HIS LIQUID VOICE THEM ELEGANT LINES OUT OF POPE'S HOMER AS WHEN THE MOON REFULGENT LAMP OF NIGHT O'ER HEAVEN'S CLEAR AZURE SPREADS HER SACRED LIGHT
6848-252323-0032 WHEN NOT A BREATH DISTURBS THE DEEP SERENE AND NOT A CLOUD O'ERCASTS THE SOLEMN SCENE AROUND HER THRONE THE VIVID PLANETS ROLL AND STARS UNNUMBERED GILD THE GLOWING POLE O'ER THE DARK TREES A YELLOWER VERDURE SHED
6848-252323-0033 AND TOP WITH SILVER EVERY MOUNTAIN'S HEAD THEN SHINE THE VALES THE ROCKS IN PROSPECT RISE A FLOOD OF GLORY BURSTS FROM ALL THE SKIES THE CONSCIOUS SWAINS REJOICING IN THE SIGHT
6848-252323-0034 EYE THE BLUE VAULT AND BLESS THE USEFUL LIGHT THE LORD FORGIVE ME BUT WHEN HE CAME TO THE LAST WORDS AND SAID USEFUL LIGHT I COULDN'T RESTRAIN MYSELF BUT BROKE OUT THAT'S MIGHTY LIKE A BULL ANYHOW
6848-252323-0035 IS IT YOU SAID HE WITH A QUIET LAUGH THAT ACCUSES POPE OF A BULL IT IS SAYS I AND WHAT'S MORE THERE ISN'T A POET FROM HORACE DOWNWARDS THAT I WON'T SHOW BULLS IN THERE'S BULLS IN SHAKSPEARE AND IN MILTON
6848-252323-0036 THERE'S BULLS IN THE ANCIENTS I LL POINT OUT A BULL IN ARISTOPHANES WHAT HAVE WE HERE SAID HE TURNING TO THE OTHERS A POOR CRAYTURE SAYS I LIKE GOLDSMITH'S CHEST OF DRAWERS
6848-252323-0037 WITH BRAINS REDUCED A DOABLE DEBT TO PAY TO DREAM BY NIGHT SELL SHEFFIELD WARE BY DAY WELL WITH THAT HE TOOK A FIT OF LAUGHING AND HANDING THE REST OUT OF THE BOAT
6848-252323-0038 HE MADE ME COME ALONG AT HIS SIDE DISCOORSIN ME ABOUT MY THRAVELS AND ALL I SEEN AND ALL I READ TILL WE REACHED AN ELEGANT LITTLE COTTAGE ON A BANK RIGHT OVER THE LAKE AND THEN HE BROUGHT ME IN AND MADE ME TAKE TAY WITH THE FAMILY AND I SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
6848-252323-0039 AND FOR MANY AN HOUR AFTERWARDS WHEN I JUST THINK OVER THEIR KIND WORDS AND PLEASANT FACES MORE THAN ONE OF THE COMPANY HAD DROPPED OFF ASLEEP DURING BILLY'S NARRATIVE AND OF THE OTHERS THEIR COMPLAISANCE AS LISTENERS APPEARED TAXED TO THE UTMOST
6848-252323-0040 WHILE THE CORPORAL SNORED LOUDLY LIKE A MAN WHO HAD A RIGHT TO INDULGE HIMSELF TO THE FULLEST EXTENT THERE'S THE BELL AGAIN MUTTERED ONE THAT'S FROM THE LORD'S ROOM AND CRAGGS STARTING UP BY THE INSTINCT OF HIS OFFICE HASTENED OFF
6848-76049-0000 TWO GENTLEMEN WERE COMING TOWARDS HER ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WHOSE MINDS IT CHANCED WERE VERY BUSILY OCCUPIED BY HER AFFAIRS ONE OF THESE WAS HER FATHER WHO WAS LYING IN HIS BRASS BED IN HIS COMMODIOUS CABIN ON THE HOLLANDIA
6848-76049-0001 REGRETTING HIS DIMINISHING ABILITY TO SLEEP IN THE EARLY MORNING NOW EVEN WHEN HE WAS IN THE STRONG AND SOOTHING AIR OF MID ATLANTIC AND THINKING OF V V BECAUSE SHE HAD A WAY OF COMING INTO HIS MIND WHEN IT WAS UNDEFENDED
6848-76049-0002 AND THE OTHER WAS MISTER GUNTER LAKE ON THE MEGANTIC ONE DAY OUT FROM SANDY HOOK WHO FOUND HIMSELF EQUALLY SLEEPLESS AND PREOCCUPIED AND ALTHOUGH MISTER LAKE WAS A MAN OF VAST ACTIVITIES AND COMPLICATED ENGAGEMENTS
6848-76049-0003 HE WAS COMING NOW TO EUROPE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF SEEING V V AND HAVING THINGS OUT WITH HER FULLY AND COMPLETELY BECAUSE IN SPITE OF ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED SHE MADE SUCH AN ENDLESS SERIES OF DELAYS IN COMING TO AMERICA
6848-76049-0004 OLD GRAMMONT AS HE APPEARED UPON THE PILLOW OF HIS BED BY THE LIGHT OF A ROSE SHADED BEDSIDE LAMP WAS A SMALL HEADED GREY HAIRED GENTLEMAN WITH A WRINKLED FACE AND SUNKEN BROWN EYES YEARS OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE
6848-76049-0005 MITIGATED ONLY BY SUCH EXERCISE AS THE GAME OF POKER AFFORDS HAD INTENSIFIED AN INSTINCTIVE INEXPRESSIVENESS UNDER THE MOST SOLITARY CIRCUMSTANCES OLD GRAMMONT WAS STILL INEXPRESSIVE
6848-76049-0006 HE WAS NOT EVEN TRYING TO SLEEP WHY HE MEDITATED HAD V V STAYED ON IN EUROPE SO MUCH LONGER THAN SHE NEED HAVE DONE AND WHY HAD GUNTER LAKE SUDDENLY GOT INTO A STATE OF MIND ABOUT HER
6848-76049-0007 WHY DIDN'T THE GIRL CONFIDE IN HER FATHER AT LEAST ABOUT THESE THINGS WHAT WAS AFOOT SHE HAD THROWN OVER LAKE ONCE AND IT SEEMED SHE WAS GOING TO TURN HIM DOWN AGAIN WELL
6848-76049-0008 WHATEVER ELSE YOU CALLED HER AND NO ONE COULD CALL GRAMMONT BLOOD ALL ORDINARY FLUID OLD GRAMMONT HAD NEVER HAD ANY DELUSIONS ABOUT LAKE IF LAKE'S FATHER HADN'T BEEN A BIG MAN
6848-76049-0009 LAKE WOULD NEVER HAVE COUNTED FOR ANYTHING AT ALL SUPPOSE SHE DID TURN HIM DOWN IN ITSELF THAT WASN'T A THING TO BREAK HER FATHER'S HEART WHAT DID MATTER WAS NOT WHETHER SHE THREW LAKE OVER BUT WHAT SHE THREW HIM OVER FOR
6848-76049-0010 IF IT WAS BECAUSE HE WASN'T MAN ENOUGH WELL AND GOOD BUT IF IT WAS FOR SOME OTHER LOVER SOME GOOD LOOKING WORTHLESS IMPOSTOR SOME EUROPEAN TITLE OR SUCHLIKE FOLLY
6848-76049-0011 ENTERTAINING A LOVER BEING POSSIBLY MOST SHAMEFUL THOUGHT IN LOVE LIKE SOME ORDINARY SILLY FEMALE SINKING TO KISSES TO THE DEEDS ONE COULD BUY AND PAY FOR HIS V V
6848-76049-0012 WHAT HAVE YOU FOUND OUT AGAINST HER HE HAD ASKED IN A LOW EVEN VOICE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SIR SAID THE AGENT SUDDENLY WHITE TO THE LIPS
6848-76049-0013 OLD GRAMMONT STARED AT HIS MEMORY OF THAT MOMENT FOR A WHILE THAT AFFAIR WAS ALL RIGHT QUITE ALL RIGHT OF COURSE IT WAS ALL RIGHT AND ALSO HAPPILY CASTON WAS AMONG THE DEAD
6848-76049-0014 BUT IT WAS WELL HER BROKEN ENGAGEMENT WITH LAKE HAD BEEN RESUMED AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN BROKEN OFF IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY TALK THAT FACT ANSWERED IT AND NOW THAT LAKE HAD SERVED HIS PURPOSE

6848-76049-0035 AND TELL THEM TO SEND THEIR INSTRUCTIONS TO WELLS
6880-216547-0000 THE FOLLOWING LETTER SERVED AS A PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION OF THIS MEMOIR
6880-216547-0001 PARIS JUNE THIRTIETH EIGHTEEN FORTY GENTLEMEN IN THE COURSE OF YOUR DEBATE OF THE NINTH OF MAY EIGHTEEN THIRTY THREE IN REGARD TO THE TRIENNIAL PENSION ESTABLISHED BY MADAME SUARD
6880-216547-0002 YOU EXPRESSED THE FOLLOWING WISH THE ACADEMY REQUESTS THE TITULARY TO PRESENT IT ANNUALLY DURING THE FIRST FORTNIGHT IN JULY WITH A SUCCINCT AND LOGICAL STATEMENT OF THE VARIOUS STUDIES WHICH HE HAS PURSUED DURING THE YEAR
6880-216547-0003 WHICH HAS JUST EXPIRED I NOW PROPOSE GENTLEMEN TO DISCHARGE THIS DUTY
6880-216547-0004 WHEN I SOLICITED YOUR VOTES I BOLDLY AVOWED MY INTENTION TO BEND MY EFFORTS TO THE DISCOVERY OF SOME MEANS OF AMELIORATING THE PHYSICAL
6880-216547-0005 MORAL AND INTELLECTUAL CONDITION OF THE MERE NUMEROUS AND POORER CLASSES THIS IDEA FOREIGN AS IT MAY HAVE SEEMED TO THE OBJECT OF MY CANDIDACY YOU RECEIVED FAVORABLY
6880-216547-0006 YOU CHANGED THIS FORMAL OFFER INTO AN INVIOLABLE AND SACRED OBLIGATION THENCEFORTH I UNDERSTOOD WITH HOW WORTHY AND HONORABLE A SOCIETY I HAD TO DEAL MY REGARD FOR ITS ENLIGHTENMENT MY RECOGNITION OF ITS BENEFITS
6880-216547-0007 MY ENTHUSIASM FOR ITS GLORY WERE UNBOUNDED CONVINCED AT ONCE THAT IN ORDER TO BREAK LOOSE FROM THE BEATEN PATHS OF OPINIONS AND SYSTEMS IT WAS NECESSARY TO PROCEED IN MY STUDY OF MAN AND SOCIETY
6880-216547-0008 BY SCIENTIFIC METHODS AND IN A RIGOROUS MANNER I DEVOTED ONE YEAR TO PHILOLOGY AND GRAMMAR LINGUISTICS OR THE NATURAL HISTORY OF SPEECH BEING OF ALL THE SCIENCES THAT
6880-216547-0009 SEEMED TO BEAR THE CLOSEST RELATION TO THE RESEARCHES WHICH I WAS ABOUT TO COMMENCE
6880-216547-0010 IF IT DID NOT REVEAL THE ASTONISHING SUCCESS AT LEAST BORE WITNESS TO THE THOROUGHNESS OF MY LABORS SINCE THAT TIME METAPHYSICS AND MORAL SCIENCE HAVE BEEN MY ONLY STUDIES
6880-216547-0011 MY PERCEPTION OF THE FACT THAT THESE SCIENCES THOUGH BADLY DEFINED AS TO THEIR OBJECT AND NOT CONFINED TO THEIR SPHERE ARE LIKE THE NATURAL SCIENCES SUSCEPTIBLE OF DEMONSTRATION AND CERTAINTY
6880-216547-0012 HAS ALREADY REWARDED MY EFFORTS BUT GENTLEMEN OF ALL THE MASTERS WHOM I HAVE FOLLOWED TO NONE DO I OWE SO MUCH AS TO YOU
6880-216547-0013 YOUR CO OPERATION YOUR PROGRAMMES YOUR INSTRUCTIONS IN AGREEMENT WITH MY SECRET WISHES AND MOST CHERISHED HOPES HAVE AT NO TIME FAILED TO ENLIGHTEN ME AND TO POINT OUT MY ROAD THIS MEMOIR ON PROPERTY
6880-216547-0014 IS THE CHILD OF YOUR THOUGHT
6880-216547-0015 TO WHAT CAUSES MUST WE ATTRIBUTE THE CONTINUALLY INCREASING NUMBER OF SUICIDES AND WHAT ARE THE PROPER MEANS FOR ARRESTING THE EFFECTS OF THIS MORAL CONTAGION
6880-216547-0016 THEREBY IT ASKED IN LESS GENERAL TERMS WHAT WAS THE CAUSE OF THE SOCIAL EVIL AND WHAT WAS ITS REMEDY YOU ADMITTED THAT YOURSELVES GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0017 WHEN YOUR COMMITTEE REPORTED THAT THE COMPETITORS HAD ENUMERATED WITH EXACTNESS THE IMMEDIATE AND PARTICULAR CAUSES OF SUICIDE AS WELL AS THE MEANS OF PREVENTING EACH OF THEM BUT THAT FROM THIS ENUMERATION
6880-216547-0018 CHRONICLED WITH MORE OR LESS SKILL NO POSITIVE INFORMATION HAD BEEN GAINED EITHER AS TO THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THE EVIL OR AS TO ITS REMEDY IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY NINE
6880-216547-0019 YOUR PROGRAMME ALWAYS ORIGINAL AND VARIED IN ITS ACADEMICAL EXPRESSION BECAME MORE EXACT THE INVESTIGATIONS OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY EIGHT HAD POINTED OUT AS THE CAUSES OR RATHER AS THE SYMPTOMS OF THE SOCIAL MALADY
6880-216547-0020 THE NEGLECT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF RELIGION AND MORALITY THE DESIRE FOR WEALTH THE PASSION FOR ENJOYMENT AND POLITICAL DISTURBANCES ALL THESE DATA WERE EMBODIED BY YOU IN A SINGLE PROPOSITION
6880-216547-0021 THE UTILITY OF THE CELEBRATION OF SUNDAY AS REGARDS HYGIENE MORALITY AND SOCIAL AND POLITICAL RELATION IN A CHRISTIAN TONGUE YOU ASKED GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0022 WHAT WAS THE TRUE SYSTEM OF SOCIETY A COMPETITOR
6880-216547-0023 DARED TO MAINTAIN AND BELIEVED THAT HE HAD PROVED THAT THE INSTITUTION OF A DAY OF REST AT WEEKLY INTERVALS IS INSEPARABLY BOUND UP WITH A POLITICAL SYSTEM BASED ON THE EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS
6880-216547-0024 THAT WITHOUT EQUALITY THIS INSTITUTION IS AN ANOMALY AND AN IMPOSSIBILITY THAT EQUALITY ALONE CAN REVIVE THIS ANCIENT AND MYSTERIOUS KEEPING OF THE SEVENTH DAY
6880-216547-0025 THIS ARGUMENT DID NOT MEET WITH YOUR APPROBATION SINCE WITHOUT DENYING THE RELATION POINTED OUT BY THE COMPETITOR YOU JUDGED AND RIGHTLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0026 THAT THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS NOT BEING DEMONSTRATED THE IDEAS OF THE AUTHOR WERE NOTHING MORE THAN HYPOTHESES FINALLY GENTLEMEN
6880-216547-0027 THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY YOU PRESENTED FOR COMPETITION IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS
6880-216547-0028 THE ECONOMICAL AND MORAL CONSEQUENCES IN FRANCE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME AND THOSE WHICH SEEM LIKELY TO APPEAR IN FUTURE OF THE LAW CONCERNING THE EQUAL DIVISION OF HEREDITARY PROPERTY BETWEEN THE CHILDREN
6880-216547-0029 INSTEAD OF CONFINING ONE TO COMMON PLACES WITHOUT BREADTH OR SIGNIFICANCE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOUR QUESTION SHOULD BE DEVELOPED AS FOLLOWS
6880-216547-0030 CAN IT NOT RENDER IT EQUAL FOR ALL HIS GRANDCHILDREN AND GREAT GRANDCHILDREN IF THE LAW NO LONGER HEEDS THE AGE OF ANY MEMBER OF THE FAMILY CAN IT NOT BY THE RIGHT OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0031 CEASE TO HEED IT IN THE RACE IN THE TRIBE IN THE NATION CAN EQUALITY BY THE RIGHT OF SUCCESSION BE PRESERVED BETWEEN CITIZENS AS WELL AS BETWEEN COUSINS AND BROTHERS
6880-216547-0032 IN A WORD CAN THE PRINCIPLE OF SUCCESSION BECOME A PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY TO SUM UP ALL THESE IDEAS IN ONE INCLUSIVE QUESTION WHAT IS THE PRINCIPLE OF HEREDITY
6880-216547-0033 WHAT ARE THE FOUNDATIONS OF INEQUALITY WHAT IS PROPERTY SUCH GENTLEMEN IS THE OBJECT OF THE MEMOIR THAT I OFFER YOU TO DAY
6880-216547-0034 IF I HAVE RIGHTLY GRASPED THE OBJECT OF YOUR THOUGHT IF I SUCCEED IN BRINGING TO LIGHT A TRUTH WHICH IS INDISPUTABLE BUT FROM CAUSES WHICH I AM BOLD ENOUGH TO CLAIM TO HAVE EXPLAINED
6880-216547-0035 HAS ALWAYS BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD IF BY AN INFALLIBLE METHOD OF INVESTIGATION I ESTABLISH THE DOGMA OF EQUALITY OF CONDITIONS IF I DETERMINE THE PRINCIPLE OF CIVIL LAW THE ESSENCE OF JUSTICE AND THE FORM OF SOCIETY
6880-216547-0036 TO YOU GENTLEMEN WILL REDOUND ALL THE GLORY FOR IT IS TO YOUR AID AND YOUR INSPIRATION THAT I OWE IT MY PURPOSE IN THIS WORK IS THE APPLICATION OF METHOD
6880-216547-0037 TO THE PROBLEMS OF PHILOSOPHY EVERY OTHER INTENTION IS FOREIGN TO AND EVEN ABUSIVE OF IT I HAVE SPOKEN LIGHTLY OF JURISPRUDENCE I HAD THE RIGHT
6880-216547-0038 BUT I SHOULD BE UNJUST DID I NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THIS PRETENDED SCIENCE AND THE MEN WHO PRACTISE IT DEVOTED TO STUDIES BOTH LABORIOUS AND SEVERE
6880-216547-0039 ENTITLED IN ALL RESPECTS TO THE ESTEEM OF THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS BY THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND ELOQUENCE OUR LEGISTS DESERVE BUT ONE REPROACH THAT OF AN EXCESSIVE DEFERENCE TO ARBITRARY LAWS
6880-216547-0040 AND THEIR UNWARRANTED BLUNDERS HAVE DISGUSTED ME WHOEVER KNOWING THEM PARDONS THEM MAY READ THEM I HAVE SEVERELY BLAMED THE LEARNED CHRISTIAN CHURCH
6880-216547-0041 IT WAS MY DUTY THIS BLAME RESULTS FROM THE FACTS WHICH I CALL ATTENTION TO WHY HAS THE CHURCH DECREED CONCERNING THINGS WHICH IT DOES NOT UNDERSTAND
6880-216547-0042 THE CHURCH HAS ERRED IN DOGMA AND IN MORALS PHYSICS AND MATHEMATICS TESTIFY AGAINST HER IT MAY BE WRONG FOR ME TO SAY IT BUT SURELY IT IS UNFORTUNATE FOR CHRISTIANITY THAT IT IS TRUE
6880-216547-0043 TO RESTORE RELIGION GENTLEMEN IT IS NECESSARY TO CONDEMN THE CHURCH PERHAPS YOU WILL REGRET GENTLEMEN THAT IN GIVING ALL MY ATTENTION TO METHOD AND EVIDENCE
6880-216547-0044 I HAVE TOO MUCH NEGLECTED FORM AND STYLE IN VAIN SHOULD I HAVE TRIED TO DO BETTER LITERARY HOPE AND FAITH I HAVE NONE
6880-216547-0045 THAT IS THE REASON IN MY OPINION WHY AMONG SO MANY MEN OF TALENT FRANCE TO DAY COUNTS NOT ONE GREAT WRITER
6880-216547-0046 IN A SOCIETY LIKE OURS TO SEEK FOR LITERARY GLORY SEEMS TO ME AN ANACHRONISM OF WHAT USE IS IT TO INVOKE AN ANCIENT SIBYL WHEN A MUSE IS ON THE EVE OF BIRTH
6880-216547-0047 PITIABLE ACTORS IN A TRAGEDY NEARING ITS END THAT WHICH IT BEHOOVES US TO DO IS TO PRECIPITATE THE CATASTROPHE THE MOST DESERVING AMONG US IS HE WHO PLAYS BEST THIS PART WELL
6880-216547-0048 I NO LONGER ASPIRE TO THIS SAD SUCCESS WHY SHOULD I NOT CONFESS IT GENTLEMEN I HAVE ASPIRED TO YOUR SUFFRAGES AND SOUGHT THE TITLE OF YOUR PENSIONER HATING ALL WHICH EXISTS AND FULL OF PROJECTS FOR ITS DESTRUCTION
6880-216547-0049 AND THE MOST PRECIOUS FRUIT THAT I COULD WISH TO GATHER FROM THIS MEMOIR WOULD BE THE INSPIRATION OF MY READERS WITH THAT TRANQUILLITY OF SOUL WHICH ARISES FROM THE CLEAR PERCEPTION OF EVIL AND ITS CAUSE
6880-216547-0050 AND WHICH IS MUCH MORE POWERFUL THAN PASSION AND ENTHUSIASM MY HATRED OF PRIVILEGE AND HUMAN AUTHORITY WAS UNBOUNDED PERHAPS AT TIMES I HAVE BEEN GUILTY IN MY INDIGNATION
6880-216547-0051 OF CONFOUNDING PERSONS AND THINGS AT PRESENT I CAN ONLY DESPISE AND COMPLAIN TO CEASE TO HATE I ONLY NEEDED TO KNOW
6880-216547-0052 IT IS FOR YOU NOW GENTLEMEN WHOSE MISSION AND CHARACTER ARE THE PROCLAMATION OF THE TRUTH IT IS FOR YOU TO INSTRUCT THE PEOPLE AND TO TELL THEM FOR WHAT THEY OUGHT TO HOPE
6880-216547-0053 AND WHAT THEY OUGHT TO FEAR THE PEOPLE INCAPABLE AS YET OF SOUND JUDGMENT AS TO WHAT IS BEST FOR THEM APPLAUD INDISCRIMINATELY THE MOST OPPOSITE IDEAS PROVIDED THAT IN THEM THEY GET A TASTE OF FLATTERY
6880-216547-0054 TO THEM THE LAWS OF THOUGHT ARE LIKE THE CONFINES OF THE POSSIBLE TO DAY THEY CAN NO MORE DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A SAVANT AND A SOPHIST THAN FORMERLY THEY COULD TELL A PHYSICIAN FROM A SORCERER
6880-216547-0055 INCONSIDERATELY ACCEPTING GATHERING TOGETHER AND ACCUMULATING EVERYTHING THAT IS NEW REGARDING ALL REPORTS AS TRUE
6880-216547-0056 THEY ASSEMBLE LIKE BEES AT THE SOUND OF A BASIN
6880-216547-0057 MAY YOU GENTLEMEN DESIRE EQUALITY AS I MYSELF DESIRE IT MAY YOU FOR THE ETERNAL HAPPINESS OF OUR COUNTRY BECOME ITS PROPAGATORS AND ITS HERALDS
6880-216547-0058 MAY I BE THE LAST OF YOUR PENSIONERS OF ALL THE WISHES THAT I CAN FRAME THAT GENTLEMEN IS THE MOST WORTHY OF YOU AND THE MOST HONORABLE FOR ME
6880-216547-0059 TWO MONTHS AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER THE ACADEMY IN ITS DEBATE OF AUGUST TWENTY FOURTH REPLIED TO THE ADDRESS OF ITS PENSIONER BY A NOTE THE TEXT OF WHICH I GIVE BELOW
6880-216547-0060 PUBLISHED LAST JUNE BY THE TITULARY OF THE SUARD PENSION ENTITLED WHAT IS PROPERTY AND DEDICATED BY THE AUTHOR TO THE ACADEMY HE IS OF THE OPINION THAT THE SOCIETY OWES IT TO JUSTICE
6880-216547-0061 TO EXAMPLE AND TO ITS OWN DIGNITY TO PUBLICLY DISAVOW ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ANTI SOCIAL DOCTRINES CONTAINED IN THIS PUBLICATION IN CONSEQUENCE HE DEMANDS
6880-216547-0062 IN THE MOST FORMAL MANNER THE WORK OF THE SUARD PENSIONER AS HAVING BEEN PUBLISHED WITHOUT ITS ASSENT AND AS ATTRIBUTING TO IT OPINIONS DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO THE PRINCIPLES OF EACH OF ITS MEMBERS
6880-216547-0063 IN CASE HE SHOULD PUBLISH A SECOND EDITION OF HIS BOOK TO OMIT THE DEDICATION
6880-216547-0064 THAT THIS JUDGMENT OF THE ACADEMY BE PLACED UPON THE RECORDS THESE THREE PROPOSITIONS PUT TO VOTE ARE ADOPTED
6880-216547-0065 AFTER THIS LUDICROUS DECREE WHICH ITS AUTHORS THOUGHT TO RENDER POWERFUL BY GIVING IT THE FORM OF A CONTRADICTION
6880-216547-0066 I CAN ONLY BEG THE READER NOT TO MEASURE THE INTELLIGENCE OF MY COMPATRIOTS BY THAT OF OUR ACADEMY WHILE MY PATRONS IN THE SOCIAL AND POLITICAL SCIENCES WERE FULMINATING ANATHEMAS AGAINST MY BROCHURE
6880-216547-0067 WHO DID NOT KNOW ME WHO MIGHT EVEN HAVE REGARDED HIMSELF AS PERSONALLY ATTACKED BY THE TOO SHARP JUDGMENT WHICH I HAD PASSED UPON THE ECONOMISTS A PUBLICIST AS LEARNED AS HE WAS MODEST LOVED BY THE PEOPLE WHOSE SORROWS HE FELT
6880-216547-0068 HONORED BY THE POWER WHICH HE SOUGHT TO ENLIGHTEN WITHOUT FLATTERING OR DISGRACING IT
6880-216547-0069 MEMBER OF THE INSTITUTE PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY DEFENDER OF PROPERTY TOOK UP MY DEFENCE BEFORE HIS ASSOCIATES AND BEFORE THE MINISTRY
6880-216547-0070 AND SAVED ME FROM THE BLOWS OF A JUSTICE WHICH IS ALWAYS BLIND BECAUSE IT IS ALWAYS IGNORANT
6880-216547-0071 A LETTER AS HONORABLE TO ITS AUTHOR AS IT IS FLATTERING TO HIM TO WHOM IT IS ADDRESSED PARIS MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN FORTY ONE MONSIEUR
6880-216547-0072 I HASTEN TO THANK YOU FOR FORWARDING TO ME YOUR SECOND MEMOIR UPON PROPERTY I HAVE READ IT WITH ALL THE INTEREST THAT AN ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE FIRST WOULD NATURALLY INSPIRE I AM VERY GLAD THAT YOU HAVE MODIFIED SOMEWHAT
6880-216547-0073 THE RUDENESS OF FORM WHICH GAVE TO A WORK OF SUCH GRAVITY THE MANNER AND APPEARANCE OF A PAMPHLET FOR YOU QUITE FRIGHTENED ME SIR AND YOUR TALENT WAS NEEDED TO REASSURE ME IN REGARD TO YOUR INTENTIONS
6880-216547-0074 THIS PROPOSITION NOW COMING INTO NOTICE PROPERTY IS ROBBERY WAS OF A NATURE TO REPEL FROM YOUR BOOK EVEN THOSE SERIOUS MINDS WHO DO NOT JUDGE BY APPEARANCES HAD YOU PERSISTED IN MAINTAINING IT
6880-216547-0075 IN ITS RUDE SIMPLICITY BUT IF YOU HAVE SOFTENED THE FORM YOU ARE NONE THE LESS FAITHFUL TO THE GROUND WORK OF YOUR DOCTRINES AND ALTHOUGH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO GIVE ME A SHARE IN THIS PERILOUS TEACHING
6880-216547-0076 I CANNOT ACCEPT A PARTNERSHIP WHICH AS FAR AS TALENT GOES WOULD SURELY BE A CREDIT TO ME BUT WHICH WOULD COMPROMISE ME IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS I AGREE WITH YOU IN ONE THING ONLY
6880-216547-0077 NAMELY THAT ALL KINDS OF PROPERTY GET TOO FREQUENTLY ABUSED IN THIS WORLD BUT I DO NOT REASON FROM THE ABUSE TO THE ABOLITION AN HEROIC REMEDY TOO MUCH LIKE DEATH
6880-216547-0078 WHICH CURES ALL EVILS I WILL GO FARTHER I WILL CONFESS THAT OF ALL ABUSES THE MOST HATEFUL TO ME ARE THOSE OF PROPERTY BUT ONCE MORE
6880-216547-0079 THERE IS A REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL WITHOUT VIOLATING IT ALL THE MORE WITHOUT DESTROYING IT IF THE PRESENT LAWS ALLOW ABUSE WE CAN RECONSTRUCT THEM OUR CIVIL CODE IS NOT THE KORAN
6880-216547-0080 IT IS NOT WRONG TO EXAMINE IT CHANGE THEN THE LAWS WHICH GOVERN THE USE OF PROPERTY BUT BE SPARING OF ANATHEMAS FOR LOGICALLY WHERE IS THE HONEST MAN WHOSE HANDS ARE ENTIRELY CLEAN
6880-216547-0081 DO YOU THINK THAT ONE CAN BE A ROBBER WITHOUT KNOWING IT WITHOUT WISHING IT WITHOUT SUSPECTING IT DO YOU NOT ADMIT THAT SOCIETY IN ITS PRESENT STATE LIKE EVERY MAN
6880-216547-0082 HAS IN ITS CONSTITUTION ALL KINDS OF VIRTUES AND VICES INHERITED FROM OUR ANCESTORS IS PROPERTY THEN IN YOUR EYES A THING SO SIMPLE AND SO ABSTRACT THAT YOU CAN RE KNEAD AND EQUALIZE IT
6880-216547-0083 IF I MAY SO SPEAK IN YOUR METAPHYSICAL MILL ONE WHO HAS SAID AS MANY EXCELLENT AND PRACTICAL THINGS AS OCCUR IN THESE TWO BEAUTIFUL AND PARADOXICAL IMPROVISATIONS OF YOURS CANNOT BE A PURE AND UNWAVERING UTOPIST
6880-216547-0084 YOU ARE TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE ECONOMICAL AND ACADEMICAL PHRASEOLOGY TO PLAY WITH THE HARD WORDS OF REVOLUTIONS I BELIEVE THEN THAT YOU HAVE HANDLED PROPERTY
6880-216547-0085 AS ROUSSEAU EIGHTY YEARS AGO HANDLED LETTERS WITH A MAGNIFICENT AND POETICAL DISPLAY OF WIT AND KNOWLEDGE SUCH AT LEAST IS MY OPINION
6880-216547-0086 THAT IS WHAT I SAID TO THE INSTITUTE AT THE TIME WHEN I PRESENTED MY REPORT UPON YOUR BOOK I KNEW THAT THEY WISHED TO PROCEED AGAINST YOU IN THE COURTS YOU PERHAPS DO NOT KNOW BY HOW NARROW A CHANCE I SUCCEEDED IN PREVENTING THEM
6880-216547-0087 WHAT CHAGRIN I SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE FELT IF THE KING'S COUNSEL THAT IS TO SAY THE INTELLECTUAL EXECUTIONER HAD FOLLOWED IN MY VERY TRACKS TO ATTACK YOUR BOOK AND ANNOY YOUR PERSON
6880-216547-0088 I ACTUALLY PASSED TWO TERRIBLE NIGHTS AND I SUCCEEDED IN RESTRAINING THE SECULAR ARM ONLY BY SHOWING THAT YOUR BOOK WAS AN ACADEMICAL DISSERTATION AND NOT THE MANIFESTO OF AN INCENDIARY
6880-216547-0089 YOUR STYLE IS TOO LOFTY EVER TO BE OF SERVICE TO THE MADMEN WHO IN DISCUSSING THE GRAVEST QUESTIONS OF OUR SOCIAL ORDER USE PAVING STONES AS THEIR WEAPONS
6880-216547-0090 BUT SEE TO IT SIR THAT ERE LONG THEY DO NOT COME IN SPITE OF YOU TO SEEK FOR AMMUNITION IN THIS FORMIDABLE ARSENAL AND THAT YOUR VIGOROUS METAPHYSICS FALLS NOT INTO THE HANDS OF SOME SOPHIST OF THE MARKET PLACE
6880-216547-0091 WHO MIGHT DISCUSS THE QUESTION IN THE PRESENCE OF A STARVING AUDIENCE WE SHOULD HAVE PILLAGE FOR CONCLUSION AND PERORATION
6880-216547-0092 BUT THE MAJESTIC AND IMPOSING ORDER OF HUMAN SOCIETIES THAT I SOMETIMES FIND MYSELF EMBARRASSED IN ATTACKING CERTAIN ABUSES I LIKE TO REBUILD WITH ONE HAND WHEN I AM COMPELLED TO DESTROY WITH THE OTHER
6880-216547-0093 IN PRUNING AN OLD TREE WE GUARD AGAINST DESTRUCTION OF THE BUDS AND FRUIT YOU KNOW THAT AS WELL AS ANY ONE YOU ARE A WISE AND LEARNED MAN YOU HAVE A THOUGHTFUL MIND
6880-216547-0094 THE TERMS BY WHICH YOU CHARACTERIZE THE FANATICS OF OUR DAY ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO REASSURE THE MOST SUSPICIOUS IMAGINATIONS AS TO YOUR INTENTIONS BUT YOU CONCLUDE
6880-216547-0095 IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY YOU WISH TO ABOLISH THE MOST POWERFUL MOTOR OF THE HUMAN MIND YOU ATTACK THE PATERNAL SENTIMENT IN ITS SWEETEST ILLUSIONS WITH ONE WORD YOU ARREST THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL
6880-216547-0096 AND WE BUILD HENCEFORTH UPON THE SAND INSTEAD OF ON A ROCK THAT I CANNOT AGREE TO AND FOR THAT REASON I HAVE CRITICISED YOUR BOOK SO FULL OF BEAUTIFUL PAGES
6880-216547-0097 SO BRILLIANT WITH KNOWLEDGE AND FERVOR I WISH SIR THAT MY IMPAIRED HEALTH WOULD PERMIT ME TO EXAMINE WITH YOU PAGE BY PAGE THE MEMOIR WHICH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO ADDRESS TO ME PUBLICLY AND PERSONALLY
6880-216547-0098 I DESIRE ALSO THE MERIT OF PRUDENCE YOU KNOW HOW DEEP SEATED IS THE DISEASE UNDER WHICH THE WORKING PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING I KNOW HOW MANY NOBLE HEARTS BEAT UNDER THOSE RUDE GARMENTS
6880-216547-0099 WHO RISE EARLY IN THE MORNING TO LABOR TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY STRONG I TRY TO SERVE AND ENLIGHTEN THEM WHEREAS SOME ENDEAVOR TO MISLEAD THEM
6880-216547-0100 YOU HAVE NOT WRITTEN DIRECTLY FOR THEM YOU HAVE ISSUED TWO MAGNIFICENT MANIFESTOES THE SECOND MORE GUARDED THAN THE FIRST ISSUE A THIRD MORE GUARDED THAN THE SECOND
6880-216547-0101 AND YOU WILL TAKE HIGH RANK IN SCIENCE WHOSE FIRST PRECEPT IS CALMNESS AND IMPARTIALITY FAREWELL SIR NO MAN'S ESTEEM FOR ANOTHER CAN EXCEED MINE FOR YOU BLANQUI
6880-216547-0102 I SHOULD CERTAINLY TAKE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THIS NOBLE AND ELOQUENT LETTER BUT I CONFESS THAT I AM MORE INCLINED TO REALIZE THE PREDICTION WITH WHICH IT TERMINATES THAN TO AUGMENT NEEDLESSLY THE NUMBER OF MY ANTAGONISTS
6880-216547-0103 SO MUCH CONTROVERSY FATIGUES AND WEARIES ME THE INTELLIGENCE EXPENDED IN THE WARFARE OF WORDS IS LIKE THAT EMPLOYED IN BATTLE IT IS INTELLIGENCE WASTED
6880-216547-0104 I CALL PROPERTY
6880-216547-0105 TO EACH OF US PROPERTY SEEMS A POLYGON WHOSE ANGLES NEED KNOCKING OFF BUT THE OPERATION PERFORMED
6880-216547-0106 AN HYPOTHESIS ADMITTED IN MATHEMATICS ALTHOUGH NOT PROVEN WHILE I CONSIDER THAT THIS FIGURE WILL BE A CIRCLE HONEST PEOPLE CAN AT LEAST UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER
6880-216547-0107 FOR THE REST I ALLOW THAT IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE QUESTION THE MIND MAY LEGITIMATELY HESITATE BEFORE DECIDING IN FAVOR OF THE ABOLITION OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0108 TO GAIN THE VICTORY FOR ONE'S CAUSE IT DOES NOT SUFFICE SIMPLY TO OVERTHROW A PRINCIPLE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHICH HAS THE INDISPUTABLE MERIT OF SYSTEMATICALLY RECAPITULATING OUR POLITICAL THEORIES
6880-216547-0109 IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH THE OPPOSITE PRINCIPLE AND TO FORMULATE THE SYSTEM WHICH MUST PROCEED FROM IT STILL FURTHER IT IS NECESSARY TO SHOW THE METHOD BY WHICH THE NEW SYSTEM
6880-216547-0110 WILL SATISFY ALL THE MORAL AND POLITICAL NEEDS WHICH INDUCED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FIRST ON THE FOLLOWING CONDITIONS THEN OF SUBSEQUENT EVIDENCE DEPENDS THE CORRECTNESS OF MY PRECEDING ARGUMENTS
6880-216547-0111 THE DISCOVERY OF A SYSTEM OF ABSOLUTE EQUALITY IN WHICH ALL EXISTING INSTITUTIONS SAVE PROPERTY OR THE SUM OF THE ABUSES OF PROPERTY
6880-216547-0112 NOT ONLY MAY FIND A PLACE BUT MAY THEMSELVES SERVE AS INSTRUMENTS OF EQUALITY INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY THE DIVISION OF POWER THE PUBLIC MINISTRY THE JURY SYSTEM
6880-216547-0113 ADMINISTRATIVE AND JUDICIAL ORGANIZATION THE UNITY AND COMPLETENESS OF INSTRUCTION MARRIAGE THE FAMILY HEREDITY IN DIRECT AND COLLATERAL SUCCESSION THE RIGHT OF SALE AND EXCHANGE THE RIGHT TO MAKE A WILL AND EVEN BIRTHRIGHT
6880-216547-0114 A SYSTEM WHICH BETTER THAN PROPERTY GUARANTEES THE FORMATION OF CAPITAL AND KEEPS UP THE COURAGE OF ALL
6880-216547-0115 THE ROAD THAT HE SHALL TRAVERSE WILL SUFFICE TO SHOW THE END
6925-80680-0000 ONE HOT NIGHT IN HINDUSTAN A KING AND QUEEN LAY AWAKE IN THE PALACE IN THE MIDST OF THE CITY EVERY NOW AND THEN A FAINT AIR BLEW THROUGH THE LATTICE AND THEY HOPED THEY WERE GOING TO SLEEP BUT THEY NEVER DID PRESENTLY THEY BECAME MORE BROAD AWAKE THAN EVER
6925-80680-0001 AT THE SOUND OF A HOWL OUTSIDE THE PALACE LISTEN TO THAT TIGER REMARKED THE KING TIGER REPLIED THE QUEEN HOW SHOULD THERE BE A TIGER INSIDE THE CITY IT WAS ONLY A JACKAL I TELL YOU IT WAS A TIGER SAID THE KING AND I TELL YOU THAT YOU WERE DREAMING
6925-80680-0002 IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS ANYTHING BUT A JACKAL ANSWERED THE QUEEN I SAY IT WAS A TIGER CRIED THE KING DON'T CONTRADICT ME NONSENSE SNAPPED THE QUEEN IT WAS A JACKAL AND THE DISPUTE WAXED SO WARM THAT THE KING SAID AT LAST VERY WELL
6925-80680-0003 WE'LL CALL THE GUARD AND ASK AND IF IT WAS A JACKAL I'LL LEAVE THIS KINGDOM TO YOU AND GO AWAY AND IF IT WAS A TIGER THEN YOU SHALL GO AND I WILL MARRY A NEW WIFE AS YOU LIKE ANSWERED THE QUEEN THERE ISN'T ANY DOUBT WHICH IT WAS
6925-80680-0004 SO THE KING CALLED THE TWO SOLDIERS WHO WERE ON GUARD OUTSIDE AND PUT THE QUESTION TO THEM BUT WHILST THE DISPUTE WAS GOING ON THE KING AND QUEEN HAD GOT SO EXCITED AND TALKED SO LOUD THAT THE GUARDS HAD HEARD NEARLY ALL THEY SAID AND ONE MAN OBSERVED TO THE OTHER
6925-80680-0005 MIND YOU DECLARE THAT THE KING IS RIGHT IT CERTAINLY WAS A JACKAL BUT IF WE SAY SO THE KING WILL PROBABLY NOT KEEP HIS WORD ABOUT GOING AWAY AND WE SHALL GET INTO TROUBLE SO WE HAD BETTER TAKE HIS SIDE TO THIS THE OTHER AGREED
6925-80680-0006 THE KING MADE NO REMARK BUT SENT FOR A PALANQUIN AND ORDERED THE QUEEN TO BE PLACED IN IT BIDDING THE FOUR BEARERS OF THE PALANQUIN TO TAKE HER A LONG WAY OFF INTO THE FOREST AND THERE LEAVE HER IN SPITE OF HER TEARS SHE WAS FORCED TO OBEY
6925-80680-0007 AND AWAY THE BEARERS WENT FOR THREE DAYS AND THREE NIGHTS UNTIL THEY CAME TO A DENSE WOOD
6925-80680-0008 AND STARTED HOME AGAIN NOW THE QUEEN THOUGHT TO HERSELF THAT THE KING COULD NOT MEAN TO SEND HER AWAY FOR GOOD AND THAT AS SOON AS HE HAD GOT OVER HIS FIT OF TEMPER HE WOULD SUMMON HER BACK SO SHE STAYED QUITE STILL FOR A LONG TIME LISTENING WITH ALL HER EARS FOR APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS
6925-80680-0009 BUT HEARD NONE AFTER A WHILE SHE GREW NERVOUS FOR SHE WAS ALL ALONE AND PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE PALANQUIN AND LOOKED ABOUT HER DAY WAS JUST BREAKING AND BIRDS AND INSECTS WERE BEGINNING TO STIR
6925-80680-0010 BUT ALTHOUGH THE QUEEN'S EYES WANDERED IN ALL DIRECTIONS THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY HUMAN BEING THEN HER SPIRIT GAVE WAY AND SHE BEGAN TO CRY IT SO HAPPENED THAT CLOSE TO THE SPOT WHERE THE QUEEN'S PALANQUIN HAD BEEN SET DOWN THERE DWELT A MAN WHO HAD A TINY FARM IN THE MIDST OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0011 WHERE HE AND HIS WIFE LIVED ALONE FAR FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS AS IT WAS HOT WEATHER THE FARMER HAD BEEN SLEEPING ON THE FLAT ROOF OF HIS HOUSE BUT WAS AWAKENED BY THE SOUND OF WEEPING HE JUMPED UP AND RAN DOWNSTAIRS AS FAST AS HE COULD AND INTO THE FOREST TOWARDS THE PLACE THE SOUND CAME FROM
6925-80680-0012 AND WHEN SHE HAD TOLD HER STORY THE FARMER CALLED HIS WIFE WHO LED HER TO THEIR HOUSE AND GAVE HER FOOD TO EAT AND A BED TO LIE ON AND IN THE FARM A FEW DAYS LATER A LITTLE PRINCE WAS BORN AND BY HIS MOTHER'S WISH NAMED AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0013 YEARS PASSED WITHOUT A SIGN FROM THE KING HIS WIFE MIGHT HAVE BEEN DEAD FOR ALL HE SEEMED TO CARE THOUGH THE QUEEN STILL LIVED WITH THE FARMER AND THE LITTLE PRINCE HAD BY THIS TIME GROWN UP INTO A STRONG HANDSOME AND HEALTHY YOUTH OUT IN THE FOREST THEY SEEMED FAR FROM THE WORLD
6925-80680-0014 VERY FEW EVER CAME NEAR THEM AND THE PRINCE WAS CONTINUALLY BEGGING HIS MOTHER AND THE FARMER TO BE ALLOWED TO GO AWAY AND SEEK ADVENTURES AND TO MAKE HIS OWN LIVING BUT SHE AND THE WISE FARMER ALWAYS COUNSELLED HIM TO WAIT UNTIL
6925-80680-0015 AT LAST WHEN HE WAS EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE THEY HAD NOT THE HEART TO FORBID HIM ANY LONGER
6925-80680-0016 A BIG BRASS POT TO HOLD WATER A FEW PIECES OF SILVER
6925-80680-0017 MANY A WEARY MILE HE TRAMPED DAY AFTER DAY UNTIL ONE MORNING HE SAW BEFORE HIM JUST SUCH A FOREST AS THAT IN WHICH HE HAD BEEN BORN AND BRED AND HE STEPPED JOYFULLY INTO IT LIKE ONE WHO GOES TO MEET AN OLD FRIEND
6925-80680-0018 PRESENTLY AS HE MADE HIS WAY THROUGH A THICKET HE SAW A PIGEON WHICH HE THOUGHT WOULD MAKE A GOOD DINNER SO HE FIRED A PELLET AT IT FROM HIS GALAIL BUT MISSED THE PIGEON WHICH FLUTTERED AWAY WITH A STARTLED CLATTER AT THE SAME INSTANT HE HEARD A GREAT CLAMOUR FROM BEYOND THE THICKET
6925-80680-0019 AND ON REACHING THE SPOT HE FOUND AN UGLY OLD WOMAN STREAMING WET AND CRYING LOUDLY AS SHE LIFTED FROM HER HEAD
6925-80680-0020 THE OLD WOMAN'S FACE BRIGHTENED SHE SHOWED HIM WHERE TO SEEK THE WATER AND WHEN HE RETURNED A FEW MINUTES LATER WITH HIS POT FILLED TO THE BRIM SHE LED THE WAY WITHOUT A WORD AND HE FOLLOWED IN A SHORT WHILE THEY CAME TO A HUT IN THE FOREST
6925-80680-0021 AND AS THEY DREW NEAR IT AMEER ALI BEHELD IN THE DOORWAY THE LOVELIEST DAMSEL HIS EYES HAD EVER LOOKED ON AT THE SIGHT OF A STRANGER SHE DREW HER VEIL ABOUT HER AND STEPPED INTO THE HUT AND MUCH AS HE WISHED TO SEE HER AGAIN
6925-80680-0022 AMEER ALI COULD THINK OF NO EXCUSE BY WHICH TO BRING HER BACK AND SO WITH A HEAVY HEART HE MADE HIS SALUTATION AND BADE THE OLD WOMAN FAREWELL BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE A LITTLE WAY SHE CALLED AFTER HIM IF EVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE OR DANGER
6925-80680-0023 COME TO WHERE YOU NOW STAND AND CRY FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME NOW AND I WILL LISTEN TO YOU THE PRINCE THANKED HER AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY BUT HE THOUGHT LITTLE OF THE OLD WOMAN'S SAYING AND MUCH OF THE LOVELY DAMSEL
6925-80680-0024 SHORTLY AFTERWARDS HE ARRIVED AT A CITY AND AS HE WAS NOW IN GREAT STRAITS
6925-80680-0025 THE KING SAID HE HAD PLENTY OF SERVANTS AND WANTED NO MORE
6925-80680-0026 AND PROMISED THAT HE SHOULD ENTER HIS BODYGUARD ON THE CONDITION THAT HE WOULD UNDERTAKE ANY SERVICE WHICH WAS ESPECIALLY DIFFICULT OR DANGEROUS THIS WAS JUST WHAT AMEER ALI WANTED AND HE AGREED TO DO WHATEVER THE KING MIGHT WISH
6925-80680-0027 SOON AFTER THIS ON A DARK AND STORMY NIGHT WHEN THE RIVER ROARED BENEATH THE PALACE WALLS THE SOUND OF A WOMAN WEEPING AND WAILING WAS HEARD ABOVE THE STORM THE KING ORDERED A SERVANT TO GO AND SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT THE SERVANT FALLING ON HIS KNEES IN TERROR
6925-80680-0028 BEGGED THAT HE MIGHT NOT BE SENT ON SUCH AN ERRAND PARTICULARLY ON A NIGHT SO WILD WHEN EVIL SPIRITS AND WITCHES WERE SURE TO BE ABROAD INDEED SO FRIGHTENED WAS HE THAT THE KING WHO WAS VERY KIND HEARTED BADE ANOTHER TO GO IN HIS STEAD
6925-80680-0029 BUT EACH ONE SHOWED THE SAME STRANGE FEAR THEN AMEER ALI STEPPED FORWARD THIS IS MY DUTY YOUR MAJESTY HE SAID I WILL GO THE KING NODDED AND OFF HE WENT THE NIGHT WAS AS DARK AS PITCH
6925-80680-0030 BUT HE MADE HIS WAY DOWN TO THE FORD UNDER THE PALACE WALLS AND STEPPED INTO THE FLOODED WATER INCH BY INCH AND FOOT BY FOOT HE FOUGHT HIS WAY ACROSS NOW NEARLY SWEPT OFF HIS FEET BY SOME SUDDEN SWIRL OR EDDY NOW NARROWLY ESCAPING
6925-80680-0031 BEING CAUGHT IN THE BRANCHES OF SOME FLOATING TREE THAT CAME TOSSING AND SWINGING DOWN THE STREAM AT LENGTH HE EMERGED PANTING AND DRIPPING WET ON THE OTHER SIDE CLOSE BY THE BANK STOOD A GALLOWS AND ON THE GALLOWS HUNG THE BODY OF SOME EVILDOER
6925-80680-0032 WHILST FROM THE FOOT OF IT CAME THE SOUND OF SOBBING THAT THE KING HAD HEARD
6925-80680-0033 OR OF THE ROARING RIVER AS FOR GHOSTS AND WITCHES THEY HAD NEVER TROUBLED HIM SO HE WALKED UP TOWARDS THE GALLOWS WHERE CROUCHED THE FIGURE OF THE WOMAN WHAT AILS YOU HE SAID NOW THE WOMAN WAS NOT REALLY A WOMAN AT ALL
6925-80680-0034 BUT A HORRID KIND OF WITCH WHO REALLY LIVED IN WITCHLAND AND HAD NO BUSINESS ON EARTH IF EVER A MAN STRAYED INTO WITCHLAND THE OGRESSES USED TO EAT HIM UP AND THIS OLD WITCH THOUGHT SHE WOULD LIKE TO CATCH A MAN FOR SUPPER
6925-80680-0035 IN HOPES THAT SOMEONE OUT OF PITY MIGHT COME TO HER RESCUE SO WHEN AMEER ALI QUESTIONED HER SHE REPLIED AH KIND SIR IT IS MY POOR SON WHO HANGS UPON THAT GALLOWS HELP ME TO GET HIM DOWN AND I WILL BLESS YOU FOR EVER
6925-80680-0036 AMEER ALI THOUGHT THAT HER VOICE SOUNDED RATHER EAGER
6925-80680-0037 AND BENT SO THAT THE OLD WOMAN COULD CLAMBER ON TO HIS BACK WHICH SHE DID VERY NIMBLY THEN SUDDENLY HE FELT A NOOSE SLIPPED OVER HIS NECK
6925-80680-0038 BUT AMEER ALI GAVE A SWEEP UPWARDS WITH HIS SHARP SWORD TO CUT THE ROPE THAT SHE HAD SLIPPED ROUND HIS NECK
6925-80680-0039 AND WITH A YELL OF PAIN AND ANGER SHE VANISHED INTO THE DARKNESS AMEER ALI THEN SAT DOWN TO COLLECT HIMSELF A LITTLE AND FELT UPON THE GROUND BY HIS SIDE AN ANKLET THAT HAD EVIDENTLY FALLEN OFF THE OLD WITCH'S FOOT
6925-80680-0040 AND AS THE STORM HAD BY THIS TIME PASSED OVER HE MADE HIS WAY BACK TO THE PALACE WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS STORY HE TOOK THE ANKLET OUT OF HIS POCKET AND HANDED IT TO THE KING WHO LIKE EVERYONE ELSE WAS AMAZED AT THE GLORY OF THE JEWELS WHICH COMPOSED IT INDEED
6925-80680-0041 AMEER ALI HIMSELF WAS ASTONISHED FOR HE HAD SLIPPED THE ANKLET INTO HIS POCKET IN THE DARK AND HAD NOT LOOKED AT IT SINCE THE KING WAS DELIGHTED AT ITS BEAUTY AND HAVING PRAISED AND REWARDED AMEER ALI HE GAVE THE ANKLET TO HIS DAUGHTER A PROUD AND SPOILED PRINCESS
6925-80680-0042 NOW IN THE WOMEN'S APARTMENTS IN THE PALACE THERE HUNG TWO CAGES IN ONE OF WHICH WAS A PARROT AND IN THE OTHER A STARLING AND THESE TWO BIRDS COULD TALK AS WELL AS HUMAN BEINGS THEY WERE BOTH PETS OF THE PRINCESS WHO ALWAYS FED THEM HERSELF AND THE NEXT DAY AS SHE WAS
6925-80680-0043 WALKING GRANDLY ABOUT WITH HER TREASURE TIED ROUND HER ANKLE SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY TO THE PARROT
6925-80680-0044 THAT WAS THE PARROT'S NAME HOW DO YOU THINK THE PRINCESS LOOKS IN HER NEW JEWEL THINK SNAPPED THE PARROT WHO WAS CROSS BECAUSE THEY HADN'T GIVEN HIM HIS BATH THAT MORNING I THINK SHE LOOKS LIKE A WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER WITH ONE SHOE ON AND THE OTHER OFF
6925-80680-0045 WHY DOESN'T SHE WEAR TWO OF THEM INSTEAD OF GOING ABOUT WITH ONE LEG ADORNED AND THE OTHER EMPTY WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THIS SHE BURST INTO TEARS AND SENDING FOR HER FATHER
6925-80680-0046 OR SHE WOULD DIE OF SHAME SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0047 OR HE SHOULD BE HANGED FOR THE PRINCESS WOULD CERTAINLY DIE OF DISAPPOINTMENT POOR AMEER ALI WAS GREATLY TROUBLED AT THE KING'S COMMAND BUT HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF THAT HE HAD AT ANY RATE A MONTH IN WHICH TO LAY HIS PLANS HE LEFT THE PALACE AT ONCE
6925-80680-0048 AND INQUIRED OF EVERYONE WHERE THE FINEST JEWELS WERE TO BE GOT BUT THOUGH HE SOUGHT NIGHT AND DAY HE NEVER FOUND ONE TO COMPARE WITH THE ANKLET AT LAST ONLY A WEEK REMAINED AND HE WAS IN SORE DIFFICULTY WHEN HE REMEMBERED THE FAIRY OF THE FOREST
6925-80680-0049 THEREFORE AWAY HE WENT AND AFTER A DAY'S TRAVELLING HE REACHED THE COTTAGE IN THE FOREST AND STANDING WHERE HE HAD STOOD WHEN THE OLD WOMAN CALLED TO HIM HE CRIED FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME HELP ME
6925-80680-0050 THEN THERE APPEARED IN THE DOORWAY THE BEAUTIFUL GIRL HE HAD SEEN BEFORE WHOM IN ALL HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD NEVER FORGOTTEN WHAT IS THE MATTER SHE ASKED IN A VOICE SO SOFT THAT HE LISTENED LIKE ONE STRUCK DUMB
6925-80680-0051 THEN HE TOLD HER HIS STORY AND SHE WENT WITHIN THE COTTAGE AND CAME BACK WITH TWO WANDS AND A POT OF BOILING WATER THE TWO WANDS SHE PLANTED IN THE GROUND ABOUT SIX FEET APART AND THEN TURNING TO HIM SHE SAID
6925-80680-0052 AND HOLD IT OVER THE CAULDRON AND EVERY DROP OF BLOOD THAT FALLS FROM IT INTO THE WATER WILL BECOME A JEWEL NEXT YOU MUST CHANGE THE WANDS SO THAT THE ONE THAT STOOD AT MY HEAD IS AT MY FEET AND THE ONE AT MY FEET STANDS AT MY HEAD AND PLACE THE SEVERED FOOT AGAINST THE WOUND AND IT WILL HEAL
6925-80680-0053 AND I SHALL BECOME QUITE WELL AGAIN AS BEFORE AT FIRST
6925-80680-0054 AT LENGTH SHE PERSUADED HIM TO DO HER BIDDING HE NEARLY FAINTED HIMSELF WITH HORROR WHEN HE FOUND THAT AFTER THE CRUEL BLOW WHICH LOPPED HER FOOT OFF SHE LAY AS ONE LIFELESS BUT HE HELD THE SEVERED FOOT OVER THE CAULDRON AND AS DROPS OF BLOOD FELL FROM IT
6925-80680-0055 AND HE SAW EACH TURN IN THE WATER INTO SHINING GEMS HIS HEART TOOK COURAGE VERY SOON THERE WERE PLENTY OF JEWELS IN THE CAULDRON AND HE QUICKLY CHANGED THE WANDS PLACED THE SEVERED FOOT AGAINST THE WOUND AND IMMEDIATELY THE TWO PARTS BECAME ONE AS BEFORE
6925-80680-0056 THEN THE MAIDEN OPENED HER EYES SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DRAWING HER VEIL ABOUT HER RAN INTO THE HUT AND WOULD NOT COME OUT OR SPEAK TO HIM ANY MORE
6925-80680-0057 BUT THREE RARE AND BEAUTIFUL ANKLETS AND THESE HE DULY PRESENTED TO THE KING ON THE VERY DAY THAT HIS MONTH OF GRACE WAS OVER THE KING EMBRACED HIM WARMLY AND MADE HIM RICH GIFTS AND THE NEXT DAY THE VAIN PRINCESS PUT TWO ANKLETS ON EACH FOOT
6925-80680-0058 AND STRUTTED UP AND DOWN IN THEM ADMIRING HERSELF IN THE MIRRORS THAT LINED HER ROOM
6925-80680-0059 AND NEVER RECOVERED HIS TEMPER UNTIL AFTER LUNCH SHE'S GOT ALL HER BEAUTY AT ONE END OF HER NOW IF SHE HAD A FEW OF THOSE FINE GEW GAWS ROUND HER NECK AND WRISTS SHE WOULD LOOK BETTER BUT NOW TO MY MIND
6925-80680-0060 SHE LOOKS MORE THAN EVER LIKE THE WASHERWOMAN'S DAUGHTER DRESSED UP POOR PRINCESS SHE WEPT AND STORMED AND RAVED UNTIL SHE MADE HERSELF QUITE ILL
6925-80680-0061 AND THEN SHE DECLARED TO HER FATHER THAT UNLESS SHE HAD BRACELETS AND NECKLACE TO MATCH THE ANKLETS SHE WOULD DIE AGAIN THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND ORDERED HIM TO GET A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS TO MATCH THOSE ANKLETS WITHIN A MONTH OR BE PUT TO A CRUEL DEATH
6925-80680-0062 AND AGAIN AMEER ALI SPENT NEARLY THE WHOLE MONTH SEARCHING FOR THE JEWELS BUT ALL IN VAIN AT LENGTH HE MADE HIS WAY TO THE HUT IN THE FOREST AND STOOD AND CRIED FAIRY OF THE FOREST FAIRY OF THE FOREST HELP ME
6925-80680-0063 ONCE MORE THE BEAUTIFUL MAIDEN APPEARED AT HIS SUMMONS AND ASKED WHAT HE WANTED
6925-80680-0064 AND HER HEAD HER WORDS TURNED AMEER ALI PALE WITH HORROR BUT SHE REMINDED HIM THAT NO HARM HAD COME TO HER BEFORE AND AT LAST HE CONSENTED TO DO AS SHE BADE HIM
6925-80680-0065 FROM HER SEVERED HANDS AND HEAD THERE FELL INTO THE CAULDRON BRACELETS AND CHAINS OF RUBIES AND DIAMONDS
6925-80680-0066 THEN THE HEAD AND HANDS WERE JOINED ON TO THE BODY AND LEFT NEITHER SIGN NOR SCAR FULL OF GRATITUDE AMEER ALI TRIED TO SPEAK TO HER BUT SHE RAN INTO THE HOUSE AND WOULD NOT COME BACK AND HE WAS FORCED TO LEAVE HER
6925-80680-0067 WHEN ON THE DAY APPOINTED AMEER ALI PRODUCED A NECKLACE AND BRACELETS EACH MORE BEAUTIFUL AND PRICELESS THAN THE LAST THE KING'S ASTONISHMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER SHE WAS NEARLY MAD WITH JOY
6925-80680-0068 THE VERY NEXT MORNING SHE PUT ON ALL HER FINERY AND THOUGHT THAT NOW AT LEAST THAT DISAGREEABLE PARROT COULD FIND NO FAULT WITH HER APPEARANCE AND SHE LISTENED EAGERLY WHEN SHE HEARD THE STARLING SAY
6925-80680-0069 HOW DO YOU THINK OUR PRINCESS IS LOOKING NOW VERY FINE NO DOUBT GRUMBLED THE PARROT BUT WHAT IS THE USE OF DRESSING UP LIKE THAT FOR ONESELF ONLY SHE OUGHT TO HAVE A HUSBAND WHY DOESN'T SHE MARRY THE MAN WHO GOT HER ALL THESE SPLENDID THINGS
6925-80680-0070 THEN THE PRINCESS SENT FOR HER FATHER AND TOLD HIM THAT SHE WISHED TO MARRY AMEER ALI
6925-80680-0071 SO THE KING SENT FOR AMEER ALI AND TOLD HIM THAT WITHIN A MONTH HE PROPOSED TO DO HIM THE HONOUR OF MARRYING HIM TO THE PRINCESS AND MAKING HIM HEIR TO THE THRONE ON HEARING THIS SPEECH
6925-80680-0072 AMEER ALI BOWED LOW AND ANSWERED THAT HE HAD DONE AND WOULD DO THE KING ALL THE SERVICE THAT LAY IN HIS POWER SAVE ONLY THIS ONE THING THE KING WHO CONSIDERED HIS DAUGHTER'S HAND A PRIZE FOR ANY MAN FLEW INTO A PASSION AND THE PRINCESS WAS MORE FURIOUS STILL
6925-80680-0073 AMEER ALI WAS INSTANTLY THROWN INTO THE MOST DISMAL PRISON THAT THEY COULD FIND AND ORDERED TO BE KEPT THERE UNTIL THE KING HAD TIME TO THINK IN WHAT WAY HE SHOULD BE PUT TO DEATH MEANWHILE THE KING DETERMINED THAT THE PRINCESS OUGHT IN ANY CASE TO BE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY
6925-80680-0074 SO HE SENT FORTH HERALDS THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES PROCLAIMING THAT ON A CERTAIN DAY ANY PERSON FITTED FOR A BRIDEGROOM AND HEIR TO THE THRONE SHOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT THE PALACE WHEN THE DAY CAME ALL THE COURT WERE GATHERED TOGETHER AND A GREAT CROWD ASSEMBLED OF MEN YOUNG AND OLD
6925-80680-0075 WHO THOUGHT THAT THEY HAD AS GOOD A CHANCE AS ANYONE ELSE TO GAIN BOTH THE THRONE AND THE PRINCESS AS SOON AS THE KING WAS SEATED HE CALLED UPON AN USHER TO SUMMON THE FIRST CLAIMANT BUT JUST THEN A FARMER WHO STOOD IN FRONT OF THE CROWD CRIED OUT THAT HE HAD A PETITION TO OFFER
6925-80680-0076 WELL HASTEN THEN SAID THE KING I HAVE NO TIME TO WASTE YOUR MAJESTY SAID THE FARMER HAS NOW LIVED AND ADMINISTERED JUSTICE LONG IN THIS CITY
6925-80680-0077 WHILST JACKALS HUNT IN EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE PICKED UP
6925-80680-0078 NO YOUR MAJESTY ANSWERED THE FARMER I WOULD ONLY REMIND YOUR MAJESTY THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF JACKALS GATHERED TO DAY TO TRY AND CLAIM YOUR DAUGHTER AND KINGDOM EVERY CITY HAS SENT THEM AND THEY WAIT HUNGRY AND EAGER BUT DO NOT O KING MISTAKE OR PRETEND AGAIN
6925-80680-0079 TO MISTAKE THE HOWL OF A JACKAL FOR THE HUNTING CRY OF A TIGER THE KING TURNED FIRST RED AND THEN PALE THERE IS CONTINUED THE FARMER A ROYAL TIGER BRED IN THE FOREST WHO HAS THE FIRST AND ONLY TRUE CLAIM TO YOUR THRONE WHERE
6925-80680-0080 GROWING PALE AS HE LISTENED IN PRISON REPLIED THE FARMER IF YOUR MAJESTY WILL CLEAR THIS COURT OF THE JACKALS I WILL EXPLAIN CLEAR THE COURT COMMANDED THE KING AND VERY UNWILLINGLY THE VISITORS LEFT THE PALACE NOW
6925-80680-0081 THEN THE FARMER TOLD THE KING AND HIS MINISTERS HOW HE HAD RESCUED THE QUEEN AND BROUGHT UP AMEER ALI AND HE FETCHED THE OLD QUEEN HERSELF WHOM HE HAD LEFT OUTSIDE AT THE SIGHT OF HER THE KING WAS FILLED WITH SHAME AND SELF REPROACH AND WISHED HE COULD HAVE LIVED HIS LIFE OVER AGAIN
6925-80680-0082 AND NOT HAVE MARRIED THE MOTHER OF THE PROUD PRINCESS WHO CAUSED HIM ENDLESS TROUBLE UNTIL HER DEATH MY DAY IS PAST SAID HE AND HE GAVE UP HIS CROWN TO HIS SON AMEER ALI WHO WENT ONCE MORE AND CALLED TO THE FOREST FAIRY TO PROVIDE HIM WITH A QUEEN TO SHARE HIS THRONE
6925-80680-0083 THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON I WILL MARRY SAID HE AND THIS TIME THE MAIDEN DID NOT RUN AWAY BUT AGREED TO BE HIS WIFE SO THE TWO WERE MARRIED WITHOUT DELAY AND LIVED LONG AND REIGNED HAPPILY AS FOR THE OLD WOMAN WHOSE PITCHER AMEER ALI HAD BROKEN
6925-80680-0084 SHE WAS THE FOREST MAIDEN'S FAIRY GODMOTHER AND WHEN SHE WAS NO LONGER NEEDED TO LOOK AFTER THE GIRL SHE GLADLY RETURNED TO FAIRYLAND THE OLD KING HAS NEVER BEEN HEARD TO CONTRADICT HIS WIFE ANY MORE IF HE EVEN LOOKS AS IF HE DOES NOT AGREE WITH HER
6925-80680-0085 SHE SMILES AT HIM AND SAYS IS IT THE TIGER THEN OR THE JACKAL

696-92939-0020 AND FURNISHING THEM WITH GUIDES TO HELP THEM TO THE DUTCH FRONTIER WHENCE THEY MIGHT ESCAPE INTO HOLLAND AND RETURN TO ENGLAND THIS WAS THE GERMAN STATEMENT IF WHAT THEY SAID WERE TRUE THERE WAS STILL NO CAUSE FOR KILLING THE UNFORTUNATE WOMAN IN THEIR POWER
696-92939-0021 FOR SHE WAS NOT ACCUSED AT ANY TIME OF HAVING BEEN A SPY BUT THEY HAD PLANNED TO TRY HER FOR HER LIFE AND MISTER WHITLOCK SOON GUESSED THIS IN SPITE OF THE FACT THAT THE GERMANS KEPT THEIR PREPARATIONS FROM HIM SO FAR AS POSSIBLE

696-92939-0031 ONLY TO LEARN LATER THAT IT HAD INDEED BEEN DECLARED AND THAT MISS CAVELL WOULD FACE A FIRING SQUAD AT TWO O'CLOCK THE FOLLOWING MORNING MISTER WHITLOCK THEN URGED BARON VON DER LANCKEN
696-92939-0032 TO MITIGATE THE SENTENCE AND AT ELEVEN IN THE EVENING HE WAS TOLD THAT VON BISSING REFUSED TO DO ANYTHING TO SAVE MISS CAVELL'S LIFE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE GOVERNOR DENIED THIS APPEAL EDITH CAVELL WAS ALLOWED TO SEE A BRITISH CHAPLAIN SHE TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS NOT IN THE LEAST AFRAID OF DEATH
696-92939-0033 AND WILLINGLY GAVE HER LIFE FOR HER COUNTRY HER WORDS RESEMBLED THOSE OF FLORENCE NIGHTINGALE THAT HAVE BEEN QUOTED ELSEWHERE IN THIS BOOK DEATH SHE SAID WAS WELL KNOWN TO HER AND SHE HAD SEEN IT SO OFTEN THAT IT WAS NOT STRANGE OR FEARFUL TO HER
696-92939-0034 EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH HER EYES BANDAGED MISS CAVELL WAS LED OUT TO FACE THE RIFLES OF THE HUNS SHE WORE AN ENGLISH FLAG OVER HER BOSOM ONLY GERMANS WERE WITNESSES OF THE EXECUTION BUT THE GERMAN CHAPLAIN WHO ATTENDED SAID THAT SHE DIED LIKE A HEROINE
696-92939-0035 WHEN HER DEATH BECAME KNOWN THE ENTIRE CIVILIZED WORLD WAS SHOCKED AND HORRIFIED IN ENGLAND THIS MURDER DID MORE TO STIMULATE RECRUITING THAN ANYTHING ELSE UP TO THAT TIME ALL DAY LONG LINES OF MEN WAITED TO SIGN THE PAPERS OF ENLISTMENT
696-92939-0036 AND IN MISS CAVELL'S HOME TOWN EVERY ELIGIBLE MAN WAS SWORN INTO THE ARMY A BITTER DENUNCIATION OF THE GERMAN ACT WAS MADE BY SIR EDWARD GREY THE GERMANS THEMSELVES HAD ONLY A POOR EXCUSE FOR WHAT THEY HAD DONE
696-92939-0037 IN BRIEF THE CASE AGAINST THE GERMAN AUTHORITIES IS AS FOLLOWS THEY HAD NOT PREVIOUSLY INFLICTED THE DEATH PENALTY FOR THE OFFENSE OF WHICH MISS CAVELL WAS ACCUSED THEY HAD KEPT HER IN SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND PREVENTED HER FROM CONSULTING AN ADVOCATE UP TO THE TIME OF HER TRIAL
696-92939-0038 SHE WAS TRIED WITH GREAT HASTE AND WITH GREAT SECRECY AND AFTER THE TRIAL THE SENTENCE WAS CARRIED OUT FAR MORE SPEEDILY THAN USUAL MOREOVER THEY HAD DECEIVED MISTER WHITLOCK AND THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE AMERICAN LEGATION AND HAD DONE SO DELIBERATELY
696-92939-0039 AFTER THE EXECUTION THEY REFUSED TO RETURN THE BODY BUT THE NAME OF EDITH CAVELL HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S GREAT NAMES AND HER FAME GROWS BRIGHTER AS TIME PASSES
696-93314-0000 THE TWO WERE ALONE IN THE GRASSY COURTYARD OF THE RUINED CASTLE THE REST OF THE PICNIC PARTY HAD WANDERED AWAY FROM THEM OR THEY FROM IT OUT OF THE GREEN GROWN MOUND OF FALLEN MASONRY BY THE CORNER OF THE CHAPEL A GREAT MAY BUSH GREW
696-93314-0001 SILVERED AND PEARLED ON EVERY SCENTED STILL SPRAY THE SKY WAS DEEP CLEAR STRONG BLUE ABOVE AND AGAINST THE BLUE THE WALLFLOWERS SHONE BRAVELY FROM THE CRACKS AND CREVICES OF RUINED ARCH AND WALL AND BUTTRESS
696-93314-0002 THEY SHINE LIKE GOLD SHE SAID
696-93314-0003 DO YOU WANT SOME HE SAID AND ON THE INSTANT HIS HAND HAD FOUND A STRONG JUTTING STONE HIS FOOT A FIRM LEDGE AND SHE SAW HIS FIGURE GREY FLANNEL AGAINST GREY STONE GO UP THE WALL TOWARDS THE YELLOW FLOWERS
696-93314-0004 OH DON'T SHE CRIED I DON'T REALLY WANT THEM PLEASE NOT I WISH THEN SHE STOPPED BECAUSE HE WAS ALREADY SOME TWELVE FEET FROM THE GROUND AND SHE KNEW THAT ONE SHOULD NOT SPEAK TO A MAN WHO IS CLIMBING RUINED WALLS
696-93314-0005 HAD LOVED HIM THESE TWO YEARS HAD LOVED HIM SINCE THE DAY OF THEIR FIRST MEETING AND THAT WAS JUST AS LONG AS HE HAD LOVED HER BUT HE HAD NEVER TOLD HIS LOVE THERE IS A CODE OF HONOUR RIGHT OR WRONG
696-93314-0006 AND IT FORBIDS A MAN WITH AN INCOME OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY A YEAR TO SPEAK OF LOVE TO A GIRL WHO IS RECKONED AN HEIRESS THERE ARE PLENTY WHO TRANSGRESS THE CODE BUT THEY ARE IN ALL THE OTHER STORIES
696-93314-0007 HE DROVE HIS PASSION ON THE CURB AND MASTERED IT YET THE QUESTIONS DOES SHE LOVE ME DOES SHE KNOW I LOVE HER DOES SHE WONDER WHY I DON'T SPEAK AND THE COUNTER QUESTIONS WILL SHE THINK I DON'T CARE
696-93314-0008 WHEN WE LET OUR EMOTIONS PLAY THE PRIMITIVE GAMES WITH US BUT ALWAYS THE MORNING BROUGHT STRENGTH TO KEEP TO HIS RESOLUTION HE SAW HER THREE TIMES A YEAR WHEN CHRISTMAS EASTER AND MIDSUMMER BROUGHT HER TO STAY WITH AN AUNT BROUGHT HIM HOME TO HIS PEOPLE FOR HOLIDAYS
696-93314-0009 AND THOUGH HE HAD DENIED HIMSELF THE JOY OF SPEAKING IN WORDS HE HAD LET HIS EYES SPEAK MORE THAN HE KNEW AND NOW HE HAD REACHED THE WALLFLOWERS HIGH UP AND WAS PLUCKING THEM AND THROWING THEM DOWN SO THAT THEY FELL IN A WAVERING BRIGHT SHOWER ROUND HER FEET
696-93314-0010 THERE WAS NO SOUND AT ALL BUT THE GRATING OF HIS FEET AS HE SET THEM ON THE STONES AND THE MOVEMENT NOW AND THEN OF A BIRD IN THE IVY THEN CAME A RUSTLE A GRITTY CLATTER LOUD FALLING STONES HIS FOOT HAD SLIPPED AND HE HAD FALLEN
696-93314-0011 NO HE WAS HANGING BY HIS HANDS ABOVE THE GREAT REFECTORY ARCH AND HIS BODY SWUNG HEAVILY WITH THE IMPETUS OF THE CHECKED FALL HE WAS MOVING ALONG NOW SLOWLY HANGING BY HIS HANDS NOW HE GRASPED AN IVY ROOT ANOTHER
696-93314-0012 AND PULLED HIMSELF UP TILL HIS KNEE WAS ON THE MOULDING OF THE ARCH SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED ANYONE WHO HAD TOLD HER THAT ONLY TWO MINUTES HAD BEEN LIVED BETWEEN THE MOMENT OF HIS STUMBLE AND THE OTHER MOMENT WHEN HIS FOOT TOUCHED THE GRASS
696-93314-0013 CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARMS JUST ABOVE THE ELBOW SHOOK HIM ANGRILY AS ONE SHAKES A NAUGHTY CHILD LOOKED HIM ONCE IN THE EYES AND BURIED HER FACE IN HIS NECK SOBBING LONG DRY BREATHLESS SOBS EVEN THEN HE TRIED TO BE STRONG
696-93314-0014 DON'T HE SAID TENDERLY DON'T WORRY IT'S ALL RIGHT I WAS A FOOL PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER THERE'S SOMEONE COMING I DON'T CARE SHE SAID
696-93314-0015 FOR THE TOUCH OF HIS CHEEK PRESSED AGAINST HER HAIR TOLD HER ALL THAT SHE WANTED TO KNOW LET THEM COME I DON'T CARE OH HOW COULD YOU BE SO SILLY AND HORRID
696-93314-0016 OH HOW COULD YOU OF COURSE A REALLY HONOURABLE YOUNG MAN
696-93314-0017 HE DIDN'T HE ACCEPTED IT WITH HIS ARMS ROUND HER AND HIS LIPS AGAINST THE FACE WHERE THE TEARS NOW RAN WARM AND SALT IT WAS ONE OF THE IMMORTAL MOMENTS THE PICTURE WAS CHARMING TOO
696-93314-0018 A PICTURE TO WRING THE HEART OF THE ONLOOKER WITH ENVY OR SYMPATHY ACCORDING TO HIS NATURE BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE ONLOOKER A MAN OF FORTY OR THEREABOUTS WHO PAUSED FOR AN INSTANT UNDER THE GREAT GATE OF THE CASTLE AND TOOK IN THE FULL CHARM AND MEANING OF THE SCENE
696-93314-0019 HE TURNED AWAY AND WENT BACK ALONG THE GREEN PATH WITH HELL IN HIS HEART THE OTHER TWO WERE IN PARADISE THE ONLOOKER FELL LIKE THE THIRD IN EDEN THE SERPENT IN FACT TWO MILES AWAY HE STOPPED AND LIT A PIPE
696-93314-0020 IT'S GOT TO BE BORNE I SUPPOSE HE SAID LIKE ALL THE REST OF IT SHE'S HAPPY ENOUGH I OUGHT TO BE GLAD ANYWAY I CAN'T STOP IT PERHAPS HE SWORE A LITTLE
696-93314-0021 IF HE DID THE LESS PRECISE AND DEVOTIONAL MAY PARDON HIM HE HAD LOVED THE GIRL SINCE HER EARLY TEENS AND IT WAS ONLY YESTERDAY'S POST THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM THE APPOINTMENT THAT ONE MIGHT MARRY ON THE APPOINTMENT HAD COME THROUGH HER FATHER
696-93314-0022 THE LOVER WHO CAME TO HIS LOVE OVER STREWN WALLFLOWERS DESIRED ALWAYS AS HAS BEEN SEEN TO ACT UP TO HIS MORAL IDEAS SO HE TOOK NEXT DAY A MUCH EARLIER TRAIN THAN WAS AT ALL PLEASANT
696-93314-0023 AND CALLED ON HER FATHER TO EXPLAIN HIS POSITION AND SET FORTH HIS PROSPECTS HIS COMING WAS HERALDED BY A LETTER FROM HER ONE MUST NOT QUOTE IT IT IS NOT PROPER TO READ OTHER PEOPLE'S LETTERS ESPECIALLY LETTERS TO A TRUSTED FATHER FROM A CHILD ONLY AND ADORED
696-93314-0024 ITS EFFECT MAY BE INDICATED BRIEFLY IT SHOWED THE FATHER THAT THE GIRL'S HAPPINESS HAD HAD TWO LONG YEARS IN WHICH TO LEARN TO GROW ROUND THE THOUGHT OF THE YOUNG MAN WHOM HE NOW FACED FOR THE FIRST TIME ODD
696-93314-0025 FOR TO THE FATHER HE SEEMED JUST LIKE OTHER YOUNG MEN IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT THERE WERE SO MANY MORE OF THE SAME PATTERN FROM WHOM SHE MIGHT HAVE CHOSEN AND MANY OF THEM WELL OFF TOO HOWEVER THE LETTER LAY IN THE PROSPEROUS POCKET BOOK IN THE BREAST OF THE FATHER'S FROCK COAT
696-93314-0026 AND THE LOVER WAS RECEIVED AS THOUGH THAT LETTER WERE A CHARM TO ENSURE SUCCESS A FAULTY OR AT LEAST A SLOW WORKING CHARM HOWEVER FOR THE FATHER DID NOT LIFT A BAG OF GOLD FROM HIS SAFE AND SAY TAKE HER TAKE THIS ALSO BE HAPPY
696-93314-0027 HE ONLY CONSENTED TO A PROVISIONAL ENGAGEMENT TOOK AN EARNEST INTEREST IN THE YOUNG MAN'S AFFAIRS AND OFFERED TO MAKE HIS DAUGHTER AN ANNUAL ALLOWANCE ON HER MARRIAGE AT MY DEATH SHE WILL HAVE MORE HE SAID
696-93314-0028 THE YOUNG MAN MADE A REVERENT NOTE OF THE NAME AND THE INTERVIEW SEEMED PLAYED OUT IT'S A COMPLICATED NUISANCE THE FATHER MUSED IT ISN'T EVEN AS IF I KNEW ANYTHING OF THE CHAP I OUGHTN'T TO HAVE ALLOWED THE CHILD TO MAKE THESE LONG VISITS TO HER AUNT
696-93314-0029 BUT AS UNCOMFORTABLE AS TOOTHACHE ALL THE SAME HE HAD ANOTHER CALLER THAT AFTERNOON HE WHOM WE KNOW AS THE ONLOOKER CAME TO THANK HIM FOR THE INFLUENCE THAT HAD GOT HIM THE APPOINTMENT AS DOCTOR TO THE INFLUENTIAL INSURANCE COMPANY THE FATHER OPENED HIS HEART TO THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0030 BUT I DON'T SEE HOW TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IT REALLY IS RATHER AMUSING THAT I I SHOULD HAVE TO TAP HIS BEASTLY CHEST AND LISTEN TO HIS CURSED LUNGS AND ASK SYMPATHETIC QUESTIONS ABOUT HIS IDIOTIC INFANT ILLNESSES
696-93314-0031 ONE THING HE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO REMEMBER THOSE PRETTY VIVIDLY THE CONFOUNDED PUP THE ONLOOKER HAD NEVER DONE ANYTHING WRONGER THAN YOU HAVE DONE MY GOOD READER AND HE NEVER EXPECTED TO MEET A GIANT TEMPTATION ANY MORE THAN YOU DO
696-93314-0032 WHAT DID HE DIE OF FOR THE ANSWER WAS HEART AND IN IT THE DEVIL ROSE AND SHOWED THE ONLOOKER THE REALLY ONLY TRUE AND ARTISTIC WAY TO DEVELOP THE ACTION IN THIS SITUATION SO DRAMATIC IN ITS POSSIBILITIES
696-93314-0033 THE ILLUMINATIVE FLASH OF TEMPTATION WAS SO SUDDEN SO BRILLIANT THAT THE DOCTOR ONLOOKER CLOSED HIS SOUL'S EYES AND YIELDED WITHOUT EVEN THE LEAST PRETENCE OF RESISTANCE HE TOOK HIS STETHOSCOPE FROM THE TABLE
696-93314-0034 HE WALKED WITH MORE THAN HIS ORDINARY FIRMNESS OF GAIT AS A MAN DOES WHO IS JUST DRUNK ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT HE MUST TRY TO LOOK SOBER HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET CERTAIN WORDS RINGING IN HIS EARS HEART AFFECTED PROBABLY HEREDITARY WEAKNESS
696-93314-0035 NO OFFICE IN THE WORLD WOULD INSURE YOU AND SO IT WAS ALL OVER THE DREAMS THE HOPES THE PALPITATING FAITH IN A BEAUTIFUL FUTURE HIS DAYS MIGHT BE LONG THEY MIGHT BE BRIEF BUT BE HIS LIFE LONG OR SHORT HE MUST LIVE IT ALONE
696-93314-0036 HE HAD A LITTLE FIGHT WITH HIMSELF AS HE WENT DOWN WIMPOLE STREET THEN HE HAILED A HANSOM AND WENT AND TOLD HER FATHER WHO QUITE AGREED WITH HIM THAT IT WAS ALL OVER THE FATHER WONDERED AT HIMSELF FOR BEING MORE SORRY THAN GLAD
696-93314-0037 SHE SAID WHY YOU WANT ME MORE THAN EVER BUT I MAY DIE AT ANY MOMENT SO MAY I AND YOU MAY LIVE TO BE A HUNDRED I'LL TAKE MY CHANCE
696-93314-0038 OH DON'T YOU SEE TOO THAT IF THERE IS ONLY A LITTLE TIME WE OUGHT TO SPEND IT TOGETHER IT'S IMPOSSIBLE HE SAID IT'S NO GOOD I MUST SET MY TEETH AND BEAR IT AND YOU I HOPE IT WON'T BE AS HARD FOR YOU AS IT WILL FOR ME
696-93314-0039 BUT YOU CAN'T GIVE ME UP IF I WON'T BE GIVEN UP CAN YOU HIS SMILE STRUCK HER DUMB IT WAS MORE CONVINCING THAN HIS WORDS
696-93314-0040 YOU'LL FORGIVE ME WON'T YOU I DIDN'T KNOW AND OH WHAT'S THE USE OF TALKING YET THEY TALKED FOR HOURS CONVENTIONALLY HE SHOULD HAVE TORN HIMSELF AWAY UNABLE TO BEAR THE STRAIN OF HIS AGONY
696-93314-0041 AS A MATTER OF FACT HE SAT BY HER HOLDING HER HAND IT WAS FOR THE LAST TIME THE LAST LAST TIME THERE WAS REALLY A THIRD AT THAT INTERVIEW THE ONLOOKER HAD IMAGINATION ENOUGH TO SEE THE SCENE BETWEEN THE PARTING LOVERS
696-93314-0042 THEY PARTED AND NOW THE ONLOOKER DARED NOT MEET HER DARED NOT CALL AT THE HOUSE AS HE HAD USED TO DO AT LAST THE FATHER PRESSED HIM HE WENT HE MET HER AND IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD MET THE GHOST OF HER WHOM HE HAD LOVED
696-93314-0043 HER EYES HAD BLUE MARKS UNDER THEM HER CHIN HAD GROWN MORE POINTED HER NOSE SHARPER THERE WAS A NEW LINE ON HER FOREHEAD AND HER EYES HAD CHANGED OVER THE WINE HE HEARD FROM THE FATHER THAT SHE WAS PINING FOR THE LOVER WHO HAD INHERITED HEART DISEASE
696-93314-0044 I SUPPOSE IT WAS YOU WHO SAW HIM BY THE WAY SAID HE A TALL WELL SET UP YOUNG FELLOW DARK NOT BAD LOOKING I I DON'T REMEMBER LIED THE ONLOOKER
696-93314-0045 WITH THE EYES OF HIS MEMORY ON THE WHITE FACE OF THE MAN HE HAD STABBED NOW THE LOVER AND THE ONLOOKER HAD EACH HIS OWN BURDEN TO BEAR AND THE LOVER'S WAS THE EASIER HE WORKED STILL THOUGH THERE WAS NOW NOTHING TO WORK FOR MORE
696-93314-0046 HE WORKED AS HE HAD NEVER WORKED IN HIS LIFE BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT IF HE DID NOT TAKE TO WORK HE SHOULD TAKE TO DRINK OR WORSE DEVILS AND HE SET HIS TEETH AND SWORE THAT HER LOVER SHOULD NOT BE DEGRADED HE KNEW THAT SHE LOVED HIM AND THERE WAS A KIND OF FIERCE PAIN PLEASURE
696-93314-0047 LIKE THAT OF SCRATCHING A SORE IN THE THOUGHT THAT SHE WAS AS WRETCHED AS HE WAS THAT DIVIDED IN ALL ELSE THEY WERE YET UNITED IN THEIR SUFFERING HE THOUGHT IT MADE HIM MORE MISERABLE TO KNOW OF HER MISERY BUT IT DIDN'T HE NEVER SAW HER BUT HE DREAMED OF HER
696-93314-0048 AND SOMETIMES THE DREAMS GOT OUT OF HAND AND CARRIED HIM A THOUSAND WORLDS FROM ALL THAT LAY BETWEEN THEM THEN HE HAD TO WAKE UP AND THAT WAS BAD BUT THE ONLOOKER WAS NO DREAMER AND HE SAW HER ABOUT THREE TIMES A WEEK
696-93314-0049 COVERING A CLEAR CUT MASK OF SET ENDURANCE AND THERE WAS NO WORK THAT COULD SHUT OUT THAT SIGHT NO TEMPTATION OF THE WORLD THE FLESH OR THE DEVIL TO GIVE HIM EVEN THE RELIEF OF A FIGHT HE HAD NO TEMPTATIONS HE HAD NEVER HAD BUT THE ONE
696-93314-0050 HIS SOUL WAS NAKED TO THE BITTER WIND OF THE ACTUAL AND THE DAYS WENT BY WENT BY AND EVERY DAY HE KNEW MORE AND MORE SURELY THAT HE HAD LIED AND THROWN AWAY HIS SOUL AND THAT THE WAGES OF SIN WERE DEATH AND NO OTHER THING WHATEVER
696-93314-0051 AND GRADUALLY LITTLE BY LITTLE THE WHOLE WORTH OF LIFE SEEMED TO LIE IN THE FAINT FAR CHANCE OF HIS BEING ABLE TO UNDO THE ONE TRIUMPHANTLY IMPULSIVE AND UNREASONING ACTION OF HIS LIFE
696-93314-0052 BUT THERE ARE SOME ACTS THAT THERE IS NO UNDOING AND THE HELL THAT HAD BURNED IN HIS HEART SO FIERCELY WHEN HE HAD SEEN HER IN THE OTHER MAN'S ARMS BURNED NOW WITH NEW BRIGHT LIGHTS AND INFERNAL FLICKERING FLAME TONGUES AND AT LAST OUT OF HELL
696-93314-0053 THE ONLOOKER REACHED OUT HIS HANDS AND CAUGHT AT PRAYER HE CAUGHT AT IT AS A DROWNING MAN CATCHES AT A WHITE GLEAM IN THE BLACK OF THE SURGING SEA ABOUT HIM IT MAY BE A PAINTED SPAR IT MAY BE EMPTY FOAM THE ONLOOKER PRAYED
696-93314-0054 YES SPEAKING PROFESSIONALLY I THINK YOU ARE WRONG YOU LESSEN YOUR CHANCES OF LIFE WHY DON'T YOU TRY A COMPLETE CHANGE BECAUSE IF YOU MUST KNOW MY CHANCES OF LIFE HAVE CEASED TO INTEREST ME
696-93314-0055 THE LOVER WAS SHORT WITH THE ONLOOKER BUT HE PERSISTED WELL IF ONE ISN'T INTERESTED IN ONE'S LIFE ONE MAY BE INTERESTED IN ONE'S DEATH OR THE MANNER OF IT IN YOUR PLACE I SHOULD ENLIST
696-93314-0056 IT'S BETTER TO DIE OF A BULLET IN SOUTH AFRICA THAN OF FRIGHT IN LONDON THAT ROUSED THE LOVER AS IT WAS MEANT TO DO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT BUSINESS IT IS OF YOURS SIR HE SAID
696-93314-0057 BUT IT'S YOUR BUSINESS TO KNOW THAT THEY WOULDN'T PASS A MAN WITH A HEART LIKE MINE I DON'T KNOW THEY'RE NOT SO PARTICULAR JUST NOW THEY WANT MEN I SHOULD TRY IT IF I WERE YOU IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COMPLETE CHANGE YOU'LL GO ALL TO PIECES
696-93314-0058 THAT'S ALL THE ONLOOKER GOT OUT AT THE NEXT STATION SHORT OF OWNING TO HIS OWN LIE HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD TO INSURE ITS BEING FOUND OUT FOR THE LIE IT WAS OR AT LEAST FOR A MISTAKE
696-93314-0059 AND WHEN HE HAD DONE WHAT HE COULD HE SAW THAT THE LOVER MIGHT NOT FIND IT OUT MIGHT BE PASSED FOR THE ARMY MIGHT GO TO THE FRONT MIGHT BE KILLED AND THEN WELL I'VE DONE MY BEST ANYHOW HE SAID TO HIMSELF
696-93314-0060 AND HIMSELF ANSWERED HIM LIAR YOU HAVE NOT DONE YOUR BEST YOU WILL HAVE TO EAT YOUR LIE YES THOUGH IT WILL SMASH YOUR LIFE AND RUIN YOU SOCIALLY AND PROFESSIONALLY YOU WILL HAVE TO TELL HIM YOU LIED AND TELL HIM WHY
696-93314-0061 YOU WILL NEVER LET HIM GO TO SOUTH AFRICA WITHOUT TELLING HIM THE TRUTH AND YOU KNOW IT WELL YOU KNOW BEST I SUPPOSE HE SAID TO HIMSELF BUT ARE YOU PERFECTLY CERTAIN
696-93314-0062 YE'LL MAK A FINE SOLDIER MY LAD I THINK NOT SAID THE LOVER AND HE WENT OUT FROM THE PRESENCE THIS TIME HE REELED LIKE A MAN TOO DRUNK TO CARE HOW DRUNK HE LOOKS HE DROVE IN CABS FROM HARLEY STREET TO WIMPOLE STREET
696-93314-0063 WHEN HE HAD TOLD THE GIRL EVERYTHING AND WHEN SHE WAS ABLE TO DO ANYTHING BUT LAUGH AND CRY AND CLING TO HIM WITH THIN HANDS SHE SAID DEAR I DO SO HATE TO THINK BADLY OF ANYONE BUT DO YOU REALLY THINK THAT MAN WAS MISTAKEN
696-93314-0064 HE'S VERY VERY CLEVER MY CHILD
696-93314-0065 DON'T MEAN THAT I KNOW YOU'RE ALL RIGHT THANK GOD OH THANK GOD I MEAN DON'T YOU THINK HE MAY HAVE LIED TO YOU TO PREVENT YOUR MARRYING ME
696-93314-0066 WHY SHOULD HE HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM THREE WEEKS AGO HE'S A VERY OLD FRIEND OF OURS I DO HATE TO BE SUSPICIOUS BUT IT IS ODD AND THEN HIS TRYING TO GET YOU TO SOUTH AFRICA
696-93314-0067 I'M CERTAIN HE WANTED YOU OUT OF THE WAY HE WANTED YOU TO GET KILLED OH HOW CAN PEOPLE BE SO CRUEL
7059-77897-0000 OH NO I DON'T CARE ANYTHING ABOUT HIM SAID MISSUS MUNGER TOUCHING HER PONY WITH THE TIP OF HER WHIP LASH HE'S AN ODIOUS LITTLE CREATURE AND I KNEW THAT HE WOULD GO FOR THE DANCE AND SUPPER BECAUSE MISTER PECK WAS OPPOSED TO THEM HE'S ONE OF THE ANTI PECK PARTY IN HIS CHURCH
7059-77897-0001 AND THAT IS THE REASON I SPOKE TO HIM BUT I MEANT THE OTHER GENTLEMEN YOU SAW HOW THEY TOOK IT I SAW THAT THEY BOTH MADE FUN OF IT SAID ANNIE YES THAT'S JUST THE POINT
7059-77897-0002 IT THROWS A NEW LIGHT ON IT AND IF THAT'S THE WAY NICE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO LOOK AT IT WHY WE MUST GIVE UP THE IDEA I'M QUITE PREPARED TO DO SO BUT I WANT TO SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON FIRST MISSUS MUNGER SAID ANNIE UNEASILY
7059-77897-0003 I WOULD RATHER NOT SEE MISSUS WILMINGTON WITH YOU ON THIS SUBJECT I SHOULD BE OF NO USE
7059-77897-0004 AND SHE LAID HER ARM ACROSS ANNIE'S LAP AS IF TO PREVENT HER JUMPING OUT OF THE PHAETON AS MISSUS WILMINGTON'S OLD FRIEND YOU WILL HAVE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE WITH HER BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT I WISH TO INFLUENCE HER IN FAVOUR OF THE SUPPER AND DANCE I DON'T KNOW THAT I BELIEVE IN THEM SAID ANNIE
7059-77897-0005 COWED AND TROUBLED BY THE AFFAIR THAT DOESN'T MAKE THE SLIGHTEST DIFFERENCE SAID MISSUS MUNGER IMPARTIALLY ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO IS TO KEEP STILL I WILL PUT THE CASE TO HER SHE CHECKED THE PONY BEFORE THE BAR WHICH THE FLAGMAN AT THE RAILROAD CROSSING HAD LET DOWN
7059-77897-0006 WHILE A LONG FREIGHT TRAIN CLATTERED DEAFENINGLY BY AND THEN DROVE BUMPING AND JOUNCING ACROSS THE TRACKS I SUPPOSE YOU REMEMBER WHAT OVER THE TRACK MEANS IN HATBORO OH YES SAID ANNIE WITH A SMILE SOCIAL PERDITION AT THE LEAST
7059-77897-0007 YES IT ISN'T SO BAD AS IT USED TO BE SOCIALLY MISTER WILMINGTON HAS BUILT A VERY FINE HOUSE ON THIS SIDE AND THERE ARE SEVERAL PRETTY QUEEN ANNE COTTAGES GOING UP THEY DROVE ALONG UNDER THE ELMS WHICH HERE STOOD SOMEWHAT AT RANDOM ABOUT THE WIDE GRASSLESS STREET
7059-77897-0008 BETWEEN THE HIGH WINDOWY BULKS OF THE SHOE SHOPS AND HAT SHOPS THE DUST GRADUALLY FREED ITSELF FROM THE CINDERS ABOUT THE TRACKS AND IT HARDENED INTO A HANDSOME NEWLY MADE ROAD BEYOND THE HOUSES OF THE SHOP HANDS
7059-77897-0009 THE LAWN BEFORE IT SLOPED DOWN TO THE ROAD WHERE IT ENDED SMOOTHLY AT THE BRINK OF A NEAT STONE WALL A BLACK ASPHALT PATH CURVED FROM THE STEPS BY WHICH YOU MOUNTED FROM THE STREET TO THE STEPS BY WHICH YOU MOUNTED TO THE HEAVY PORTICO
7059-77897-0010 BEFORE THE MASSIVE BLACK WALNUT DOORS THE LADIES WERE SHOWN INTO THE MUSIC ROOM FROM WHICH THE NOTES OF A PIANO WERE SOUNDING WHEN THEY RANG AND MISSUS WILMINGTON ROSE FROM THE INSTRUMENT TO MEET THEM A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN STANDING BESIDE HER TURNED AWAY
7059-77897-0011 MISSUS WILMINGTON WAS DRESSED IN A LIGHT MORNING DRESS WITH A WATTEAU FALL WHOSE DELICATE RUSSETS AND FADED REDS AND YELLOWS HEIGHTENED THE RICHNESS OF HER COMPLEXION AND HAIR WHY ANNIE SHE SAID HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU
7059-77897-0012 AND YOU TOO MISSUS MUNGER HOW VURRY NICE HER WORDS TOOK VALUE FROM THE THICK MELLOW TONES OF HER VOICE AND PASSED FOR MUCH MORE THAN THEY WERE WORTH INTRINSICALLY

7059-77897-0014 MISTER WILMINGTON AND MISSUS MUNGER ARE OLD FRIENDS THE YOUNG FELLOW BOWED SILENTLY AND ANNIE INSTANTLY TOOK A DISLIKE TO HIM HIS HEAVY JAW LONG EYES AND LOW FOREHEAD ALMOST HIDDEN UNDER A THICK BANG HE SAT DOWN CORNERWISE ON A CHAIR
7059-77897-0015 AND HAVING PREVIOUSLY COMMITTED MISSUS WILMINGTON IN FAVOUR OF THE GENERAL SCHEME ASKED HER WHAT SHE THOUGHT OF THAT PART MISTER JACK WILMINGTON ANSWERED FOR HER I SHOULD THINK YOU HAD A RIGHT TO DO WHAT YOU PLEASE ABOUT IT IT'S NONE OF THE HANDS BUSINESS IF YOU DON'T CHOOSE TO ASK THEM
7059-77897-0016 YES THAT'S WHAT ANY ONE WOULD THINK IN THE ABSTRACT SAID MISSUS MUNGER NOW LITTLE BOY

7059-77897-0020 AND THERE'S NO USE TRYING TO DENY IT AS MISTER PUTNEY SAYS HE AND I HAVE OUR RECORD AND WE DON'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY PRETENCES AND THE QUESTION IS WHETHER I OUGHT TO GO BACK ON MY FELLOW HANDS OH

7059-77900-0000 MISS NORTHWICK CALLED UPON ANNIE DURING THE WEEK WITH EXCUSES FOR HER DELAY AND FOR COMING ALONE SHE SEEMED TO HAVE INTENTIONS OF BEING POLITE BUT SHE CONSTANTLY BETRAYED HER WANT OF INTEREST IN ANNIE AND DISAPPOINTED AN EXPECTATION OF REFINEMENT
7059-77900-0001 WHICH HER PHYSICAL DELICACY AWAKENED SHE ASKED HER HOW SHE EVER CAME TO TAKE UP THE SOCIAL UNION AND ANSWERED FOR HER THAT OF COURSE IT HAD THE ATTRACTION OF THE THEATRICALS AND WENT ON TO TALK OF HER SISTER'S PART IN THEM
7059-77900-0002 THE RELATION OF THE NORTHWICK FAMILY TO THE COMING ENTERTAINMENT AND AN IMPRESSION OF FRAIL MOTTLED WRISTS AND HIGH THIN CHEEKS AND AN ABSENCE OF MODELLING UNDER AFFLUENT DRAPERY WAS THE MAIN EFFECT OF MISS NORTHWICK'S VISIT WHEN ANNIE RETURNED IT
7059-77900-0003 SHE MET THE YOUNGER SISTER WHOM SHE FOUND A GREAT BEAUTY SHE SEEMED VERY COLD AND OF A HAUTEUR WHICH SHE SUBDUED WITH DIFFICULTY BUT SHE WAS MORE CONSECUTIVELY POLITE THAN HER SISTER AND ANNIE WATCHED WITH FASCINATION HER TURNS OF THE HEAD
7059-77900-0004 HER MOVEMENTS OF LEOPARD SWIFTNESS AND ELASTICITY THE CHANGING LIGHTS OF HER COMPLEXION THE CURVES OF HER FINE LIPS THE FLUTTERING OF HER THIN NOSTRILS A VERY NEW BASKET PHAETON STOOD GLITTERING AT ANNIE'S DOOR WHEN SHE GOT HOME
7059-77900-0005 AND MISSUS WILMINGTON PUT HER HEAD OUT OF THE OPEN PARLOUR WINDOW HOW D'YE DO ANNIE SHE DRAWLED IN HER TENDER VOICE WON'T YOU COME IN YOU SEE I'M IN POSSESSION

7059-77900-0012 WE'LL JUST GO ROUND THERE AND KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONE I OUGHT TO SHOW OFF MY NEW PHAETON TO MISTER WILMINGTON FIRST OF ALL HE GAVE IT TO ME IT WOULD BE KIND OF CONJUGAL OR FILIAL OR SOMETHING
7059-77900-0013 YOU KNOW MISTER WILMINGTON AND I ARE NOT EXACTLY CONTEMPORARIES ANNIE I HEARD HE WAS SOMEWHAT YOUR SENIOR SAID ANNIE RELUCTANTLY LYRA LAUGHED
7059-77900-0014 THEY CAME ROUND INTO THE REGION OF THE SHOPS AND LYRA CHECKED HER PONY IN FRONT OF HER HUSBAND'S FACTORY IT WAS NOT IMPOSINGLY LARGE BUT AS MISSUS WILMINGTON CAUSED ANNIE TO OBSERVE IT WAS AS BIG AS THE HAT SHOPS AND AS UGLY AS THE SHOE SHOPS
7059-77900-0015 THE STRUCTURE TREMBLED WITH THE OPERATION OF ITS INDUSTRY AND AS THEY MOUNTED THE WOODEN STEPS TO THE OPEN OUTSIDE DOOR AN INNER DOOR SWUNG AJAR FOR A MOMENT AND LET OUT A ROAR MINGLED OF THE HUM AND WHIRL
7059-77900-0016 AND FINDING ITS FIRST APARTMENT EMPTY
7059-77900-0017 WHERE HER HUSBAND SAT WRITING AT A TABLE GEORGE I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO MISS KILBURN
7059-77900-0018 WITH THE HABIT HE HAD OF TOUCHING IT THERE WITH THE TIP OF HIS TONGUE MADE ANNIE THINK OF A CAT THAT HAD BEEN AT THE CREAM I'VE BEEN HOPING TO CALL WITH MISSUS WILMINGTON TO PAY MY RESPECTS BUT I'VE BEEN AWAY A GREAT DEAL THIS SEASON AND AND
7059-77900-0019 WE'RE ALL VERY HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HOME AGAIN MISS KILBURN I'VE OFTEN HEARD MY WIFE SPEAK OF YOUR OLD DAYS TOGETHER AT HATBORO THEY FENCED WITH SOME POLITE FEINTS OF INTEREST IN EACH OTHER THE OLD MAN STANDING BESIDE HIS WRITING TABLE
7059-77900-0020 AND STAYING HIMSELF WITH A SHAKING HAND UPON IT LYRA INTERRUPTED THEM WELL I THINK NOW THAT ANNIE IS HERE WE'D BETTER NOT LET HER GET AWAY WITHOUT SHOWING HER THE WORKS OH OH DECIDEDLY
7059-77900-0021 I'LL GO WITH YOU WITH GREAT PLEASURE AH HE BUSTLED ABOUT PUTTING THE THINGS TOGETHER ON HIS TABLE AND THEN REACHING FOR THE PANAMA HAT ON A HOOK BEHIND IT THERE WAS SOMETHING PATHETIC IN HIS EAGERNESS TO DO WHAT LYRA BADE HIM
7059-77900-0022 I'LL SHOW THEM THROUGH HE SAID TO HIS UNCLE AND THE OLD MAN ASSENTED WITH WELL PERHAPS YOU'D BETTER JACK AND WENT BACK TO HIS ROOM THE WILMINGTON STOCKING MILLS SPUN THEIR OWN THREADS
7059-77900-0023 AND THE FIRST ROOM WAS LIKE WHAT ANNIE HAD SEEN BEFORE IN COTTON FACTORIES WITH A FAINT SMELL OF OIL FROM THE MACHINERY AND A FINE SNOW OF FLUFF IN THE AIR AND CATCHING TO THE WHITE WASHED WALLS AND THE FOUL WINDOW SASHES
7059-77900-0024 THE TIRELESS MACHINES MARCHED BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE FLOOR AND THE MEN WHO WATCHED THEM WITH SUICIDAL INTENSITY RAN AFTER THEM BAREFOOTED WHEN THEY MADE OFF WITH A BROKEN THREAD SPLICED IT AND THEN ESCAPED FROM THEM TO THEIR STATIONS AGAIN
7059-77900-0025 THEY LOOKED AFTER LYRA AND HER NEPHEW FROM UNDER COTTON FROWSED BANGS THEY ALL SEEMED TO KNOW HER AND RETURNED HER EASY KINDLY GREETINGS WITH AN EFFECT OF LIKING
7059-77900-0026 FROM TIME TO TIME AT LYRA'S BIDDING THE YOUNG FELLOW EXPLAINED TO ANNIE SOME CURIOUS FEATURE OF THE PROCESSES
7059-77900-0027 EXCEPT WHEN JACK WILMINGTON CURTLY ORDERED THEM TO DO THIS OR THAT IN ILLUSTRATION OF SOME POINT HE WAS EXPLAINING SHE WEARIED HERSELF AS PEOPLE DO IN SUCH PLACES IN EXPRESSING HER WONDER AT THE INGENUITY OF THE MACHINERY
7059-77900-0028 IT WAS A RELIEF TO GET AWAY FROM IT ALL INTO THE ROOM COOL AND QUIET WHERE HALF A DOZEN NEAT GIRLS WERE COUNTING AND STAMPING THE STOCKINGS WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS HERE'S WHERE I USED TO WORK SAID LYRA
7059-77900-0029 AND HERE'S WHERE I FIRST MET MISTER WILMINGTON THE PLACE IS FULL OF ROMANTIC ASSOCIATIONS THE STOCKINGS ARE ALL ONE SIZE ANNIE
7059-77900-0030 I DON'T WELL THEY'RE NOT DREAMS EXACTLY ANNIE WHEN ALL'S SAID AND DONE FOR THEM WHEN THEY LEFT THE MILL SHE ASKED ANNIE TO COME HOME TO TEA WITH HER SAYING
7059-77900-0031 AS IF FROM A PERCEPTION OF HER DISLIKE FOR THE YOUNG FELLOW THAT JACK WAS GOING TO BOSTON THEY HAD A LONG EVENING TOGETHER AFTER MISTER WILMINGTON TOOK HIMSELF OFF AFTER TEA TO HIS STUDY AS HE CALLED IT
7059-77900-0032 AND REMAINED SHUT IN THERE ANNIE WAS UNEASILY AWARE OF HIM FROM TIME TO TIME BUT LYRA HAD APPARENTLY NO MORE DISTURBANCE FROM HIS ABSENCE THAN FROM HIS PRESENCE WHICH SHE HAD MANAGED WITH A FRANK ACCEPTANCE OF EVERYTHING IT SUGGESTED
7059-77900-0033 SHE TALKED FREELY OF HER MARRIAGE NOT AS IF IT WERE LIKE OTHERS BUT FOR WHAT IT WAS SHE SHOWED ANNIE OVER THE HOUSE AND SHE ENDED WITH A DISPLAY OF THE RICH DRESSES WHICH HE WAS ALWAYS BUYING HER AND WHICH SHE NEVER WORE BECAUSE SHE NEVER WENT ANYWHERE
7059-77900-0034 ANNIE SAID SHE THOUGHT SHE WOULD AT LEAST LIKE TO GO TO THE SEASIDE SOMEWHERE DURING THE SUMMER BUT NO LYRA SAID IT WOULD BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE AND YOU KNOW ANNIE I ALWAYS DID HATE TROUBLE
7059-77900-0035 AND I DON'T WANT TO BE POKED INTO A HOTEL SO I STAY IN HATBORO SHE SAID THAT SHE HAD ALWAYS BEEN A VILLAGE GIRL AND DID NOT MISS THE INTERESTS OF A LARGER LIFE AS SHE CAUGHT GLIMPSES OF THEM IN SOUTH HATBORO OR WANT THE BOTHER OF THEM
7059-77900-0036 SHE SAID SHE STUDIED MUSIC A LITTLE AND CONFESSED THAT SHE READ A GOOD DEAL NOVELS MOSTLY THOUGH THE LIBRARY WAS HANDSOMELY EQUIPPED WITH WELL BOUND GENERAL LITERATURE AT MOMENTS IT ALL SEEMED NO HARM
7059-77900-0037 AT OTHERS THE LUXURY IN WHICH THIS LIFE WAS SO CONTENTEDLY SUNK OPPRESSED ANNIE LIKE A THICK CLOSE AIR YET SHE KNEW THAT LYRA WAS KIND TO MANY OF THE POOR PEOPLE ABOUT HER AND DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD AS THE PHRASE IS
7059-77900-0038 WITH THE SUPERFLUITY WHICH IT INVOLVED NO SELF DENIAL TO GIVE FROM BUT MISTER PECK HAD GIVEN HER A POINT OF VIEW AND THOUGH SHE BELIEVED SHE DID NOT AGREE WITH HIM SHE COULD NOT ESCAPE FROM IT
7059-77900-0039 OUGHT TO BE TACIT OR EXPLICIT IN THE KISSING AND EMBRACING BETWEEN ROMEO AND JULIET
7059-77900-0040 OH THEN SAID ANNIE PERHAPS HE ACCOUNTS FOR HER PLAYING JULIET
7059-77900-0041 OH IT'S AT THE REHEARSALS YOU KNOW THAT THE FUN IS
7059-77900-0042 ANNIE LAY AWAKE A LONG TIME THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SURE THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO LIKE LYRA IF SHE DID NOT APPROVE OF HER AND THAT SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE GONE HOME TO TEA WITH HER AND SPENT THE EVENING WITH HER UNLESS SHE FULLY RESPECTED HER
7059-88364-0000 AROUND LOS ANGELES THE GREATEST AND MOST CHARACTERISTIC MOVING PICTURE COLONIES ARE BEING BUILT EACH PHOTOPLAY MAGAZINE HAS ITS CALIFORNIA LETTER TELLING OF THE PUTTING UP OF NEW STUDIOS AND THE TRANSFER OF ACTORS
7059-88364-0001 WITH MUCH SLAP YOU ON THE BACK PERSONAL GOSSIP THIS IS THE OUTGROWTH OF THE FACT THAT EVERY TYPE OF THE PHOTOPLAY BUT THE INTIMATE IS FOUNDED ON SOME PHASE OF THE OUT OF DOORS BEING THUS DEPENDENT
7059-88364-0002 THE PLANT CAN BEST BE SET UP WHERE THERE IS NO WINTER BESIDES THIS THE LOS ANGELES REGION HAS THE SEA THE MOUNTAINS THE DESERT AND MANY KINDS OF GROVE AND FIELD LANDSCAPE AND ARCHITECTURE ARE SUB TROPICAL
7059-88364-0003 BUT FOR A DESCRIPTION OF CALIFORNIA ASK ANY TRAVELLER OR STUDY THE BACKGROUND OF ALMOST ANY PHOTOPLAY IF THE PHOTOPLAY IS THE CONSISTENT UTTERANCE OF ITS SCENES IF THE ACTORS ARE INCARNATIONS OF THE LAND THEY WALK UPON
7059-88364-0004 AS THEY SHOULD BE CALIFORNIA INDEED STANDS A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THROUGH THE FILMS AN UTTERANCE OF HER OWN WILL THIS LAND FURTHEST WEST BE THE FIRST TO CAPTURE THE INNER SPIRIT OF THIS NEWEST AND MOST CURIOUS OF THE ARTS
7059-88364-0005 ALREADY THE CALIFORNIA SORT IN THE COMMERCIAL CHANNELS HAS BECOME THE BROADLY ACCEPTED IF MEDIOCRE NATIONAL FORM PEOPLE WHO REVERE THE PILGRIM FATHERS OF SIXTEEN TWENTY
7059-88364-0006 HAVE OFTEN WISHED THOSE GENTLEMEN HAD MOORED THEIR BARK IN THE REGION OF LOS ANGELES RATHER THAN PLYMOUTH ROCK THAT BOSTON HAD BEEN FOUNDED THERE AT LAST THAT LANDING IS ACHIEVED
7059-88364-0007 PATRIOTIC ART STUDENTS HAVE DISCUSSED WITH MINGLED IRONY AND ADMIRATION THE BOSTON DOMINATION OF THE ONLY AMERICAN CULTURE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY NAMELY LITERATURE INDIANAPOLIS HAS HAD HER DAY SINCE THEN
7059-88364-0008 CHICAGO IS LIFTING HER HEAD NEVERTHELESS BOSTON STILL CONTROLS THE TEXT BOOK IN ENGLISH AND DOMINATES OUR HIGH SCHOOLS IRONIC FEELINGS IN THIS MATTER ON THE PART OF WESTERN MEN ARE BASED SOMEWHAT ON ENVY AND ILLEGITIMATE CUSSEDNESS
7059-88364-0009 BUT ARE ALSO GROUNDED IN THE HONEST HOPE OF A HEALTHFUL RIVALRY THEY WANT NEW ROMANTICISTS AND ARTISTS AS INDIGENOUS TO THEIR SOIL AS WAS HAWTHORNE TO WITCH HAUNTED SALEM OR LONGFELLOW TO THE CHESTNUTS OF HIS NATIVE HEATH
7059-88364-0010 WHATEVER MAY BE SAID OF THE PATRIARCHS FROM OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES TO AMOS BRONSON ALCOTT THEY WERE TRUE SONS OF THE NEW ENGLAND STONE FENCES AND MEETING HOUSES THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BORN OR NURTURED ANYWHERE ELSE ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH
7059-88364-0011 SOME OF US VIEW WITH A PECULIAR THRILL THE PROSPECT THAT LOS ANGELES MAY BECOME THE BOSTON OF THE PHOTOPLAY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE BETTER TO SAY THE FLORENCE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA REMINDS ONE
7059-88364-0012 YET THERE IS A DIFFERENCE THE PRESENT DAY MAN IN THE STREET MAN ABOUT TOWN CALIFORNIAN HAS AN OBVIOUS MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIM THAT IS ALLIED TO THE EUCALYPTUS TREE THE POMEGRANATE CALIFORNIA IS A GILDED STATE
7059-88364-0013 IT HAS NOT THE SORDIDNESS OF GOLD AS HAS WALL STREET BUT IT IS THE EMBODIMENT OF THE NATURAL ORE THAT THE RAGGED PROSPECTOR FINDS THE GOLD OF CALIFORNIA IS THE COLOR OF THE ORANGE THE GLITTER OF DAWN IN THE YOSEMITE
7059-88364-0014 THE HUE OF THE GOLDEN GATE THAT OPENS THE SUNSET WAY TO MYSTIC AND TERRIBLE CATHAY AND HINDUSTAN THE ENEMY OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THE STATE IS MAGNIFICENT BUT THIN
7059-88364-0015 HE DECLARES IT IS AS THOUGH IT WERE PAINTED ON A BROBDINGNAGIAN PIECE OF GILT PAPER AND HE WHO DAMPENS HIS FINGER AND THRUSTS IT THROUGH FINDS AN ALKALI VALLEY ON THE OTHER SIDE THE LONELY PRICKLY PEAR AND A HEAP OF ASHES FROM A DESERTED CAMP FIRE
7059-88364-0016 HE SAYS THE CITIZENS OF THIS STATE LACK THE RICHNESS OF AN AESTHETIC AND RELIGIOUS TRADITION HE SAYS THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR TIME BUT EVEN THESE THINGS MAKE FOR COINCIDENCE
7059-88364-0017 AS THE SHADOW IT THROWS UPON THE SCREEN THIS NEWNESS CALIFORNIA HAS IN COMMON WITH ALL PHOTOPLAYS IT IS THRILLINGLY POSSIBLE FOR THE STATE AND THE ART TO ACQUIRE SPIRITUAL TRADITION AND DEPTH TOGETHER
7059-88364-0018 PART OF THE THINNESS OF CALIFORNIA IS NOT ONLY ITS YOUTH BUT THE RESULT OF THE PHYSICAL FACT THAT THE HUMAN RACE IS THERE SPREAD OVER SO MANY ACRES OF LAND THEY TRY NOT ONLY TO COUNT THEIR MINES AND ENUMERATE THEIR PALM TREES
7059-88364-0019 BUT THEY COUNT THE MILES OF THEIR SEA COAST AND THE ACRES UNDER CULTIVATION AND THE HEIGHT OF THE PEAKS AND REVEL IN LARGE STATISTICS AND THE BIGNESS GENERALLY AND FORGET HOW A FEW MEN RATTLE AROUND IN A GREAT DEAL OF SCENERY
7059-88364-0020 THEY SHOUT THEIR STATISTICS ACROSS THE ROCKIES AND THE DESERTS TO NEW YORK THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS NON EXISTENT TO THE CALIFORNIAN HIS FELLOW FEELING IS FOR THE OPPOSITE COAST LINE
7059-88364-0021 THROUGH THE GEOGRAPHICAL ACCIDENT OF SEPARATION BY MOUNTAIN AND DESERT FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY HE BECOMES A MERE SHOUTER HURRAHING SO ASSIDUOUSLY THAT ALL VARIETY IN THE VOICE IS LOST
7059-88364-0022 THEY WILL BE A DIFFERENT SET OF VIRTUES FROM THOSE OF NEW ENGLAND THERE IS NO MORE NATURAL PLACE FOR THE SCATTERING OF CONFETTI THAN THIS STATE EXCEPT THE MOVING PICTURE SCENE ITSELF BOTH HAVE A GENIUS FOR GARDENS AND DANCING AND CARNIVAL
7059-88364-0023 WHEN THE CALIFORNIAN RELEGATES THE DRAMATIC TO SECONDARY SCENES BOTH IN HIS LIFE AND HIS PHOTOPLAY AND TURNS TO THE GENUINELY EPIC AND LYRIC
7059-88364-0024 HE AND THIS INSTRUMENT MAY FIND THEIR IMMORTALITY TOGETHER AS NEW ENGLAND FOUND ITS SOUL IN THE ESSAYS OF EMERSON
7059-88364-0025 THROUGH ALL FOUR SEASONS FAIRY BEAUTY OVERWHELMS THE LUMBERING GRAND STAND PLAYERS THE TINIEST GARDEN IS A JEWELLED PATHWAY OF WONDER BUT THE CALIFORNIAN CANNOT SHOUT
7059-88364-0026 ORANGE BLOSSOMS ORANGE BLOSSOMS HELIOTROPE HELIOTROPE HE CANNOT BOOM FORTH ROSELEAVES ROSELEAVES SO THAT HE DOES THEIR BEAUTIES JUSTICE
7059-88364-0027 HERE IS WHERE THE PHOTOPLAY CAN BEGIN TO GIVE HIM A MORE DELICATE UTTERANCE AND HE CAN GO ON INTO STRANGER THINGS AND EVOLVE ALL THE SPLENDOR FILMS INTO HIGHER TYPES FOR THE VERY NAME OF CALIFORNIA IS SPLENDOR
7059-88364-0028 THE CALIFORNIA PHOTO PLAYWRIGHT CAN BASE HIS CROWD PICTURE UPON THE CITY WORSHIPPING MOBS OF SAN FRANCISCO HE CAN DERIVE HIS PATRIOTIC AND RELIGIOUS SPLENDORS FROM SOMETHING OLDER AND MORE MAGNIFICENT
7059-88364-0029 THAN THE AISLES OF THE ROMANESQUE NAMELY THE GROVES OF THE GIANT REDWOODS THE CAMPAIGN FOR A BEAUTIFUL NATION COULD VERY WELL EMANATE FROM THE WEST COAST WHERE WITH THE SLIGHTEST CARE
7059-88364-0030 GROW UP MODELS FOR ALL THE WORLD OF PLANT ARRANGEMENT AND TREE LUXURY OUR MECHANICAL EAST IS REPROVED OUR TENSION IS RELAXED OUR UGLINESS IS CHALLENGED EVERY TIME WE LOOK UPON THOSE GARDEN PATHS AND FORESTS
7059-88364-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE FOR LOS ANGELES TO LAY HOLD OF THE MOTION PICTURE AS OUR NATIONAL TEXT BOOK IN ART AS BOSTON APPROPRIATED TO HERSELF THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE NATIONAL TEXT BOOKS OF LITERATURE
7059-88364-0032 IF CALIFORNIA HAS A SHINING SOUL AND NOT MERELY A GOLDEN BODY LET HER FORGET HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD MELODRAMATICS AND TURN TO HER POETS WHO UNDERSTAND THE HEART UNDERNEATH THE GLORY EDWIN MARKHAM
7059-88364-0033 THE DEAN OF AMERICAN SINGERS CLARK ASHTON SMITH THE YOUNG STAR TREADER GEORGE STERLING THAT SON OF ANCIENT MERLIN HAVE IN THEIR SONGS THE SEEDS OF BETTER SCENARIOS THAN CALIFORNIA HAS SENT US
7059-88364-0034 THERE ARE TWO POEMS BY GEORGE STERLING THAT I HAVE HAD IN MIND FOR MANY A DAY AS CONCEPTIONS THAT SHOULD INSPIRE MYSTIC FILMS AKIN TO THEM THESE POEMS ARE THE NIGHT SENTRIES AND
7067-76047-0000 AFTER TWENTY FOUR EVENTFUL HOURS OUR TWO STUDENTS OF HUMAN MOTIVES FOUND THEMSELVES TOGETHER AGAIN BY THE FIREPLACE IN THE OLD GEORGE SMOKING ROOM THEY HAD RESUMED THEIR OVERNIGHT CONVERSATION IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE TENSION
7067-76047-0001 A BROAD AND ORIGINAL THINKER AS YOU ARE THOUGHT IS ONE MATTER RASH INCONSIDERATE ACTION QUITE ANOTHER AND ABOVE ALL IF I SPEND ANOTHER DAY IN OR NEAR THE COMPANY OF MISS
7067-76047-0002 AND BIT HIS LOWER LIP AND CONSIDERED WE MIGHT DROP BELINDA HE SUGGESTED TURNING TO HIS FRIEND AND SPEAKING IN LOW CONFIDENTIAL TONES SHE IS QUITE A MANAGEABLE PERSON QUITE
7067-76047-0003 SHE COULD FOR EXAMPLE BE LEFT BEHIND WITH THE LUGGAGE AND SENT ON BY TRAIN I DO NOT KNOW IF YOU REALIZE HOW THE LAND LIES IN THAT QUARTER IT NEEDS ONLY A WORD TO MISS GRAMMONT THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE REPLY
7067-76047-0004 FOR A MOMENT HE HAD A WILD HOPE THAT HIS COMPANION WOULD AGREE AND THEN HE PERCEIVED THAT THE DOCTOR'S SILENCE MEANT ONLY THE PREPARATION OF AN ULTIMATUM I OBJECT TO MISS GRAMMONT AND THAT SIDE OF THE THING MORE THAN I DO TO MISS SEYFFERT
7067-76047-0005 SIR RICHMOND SAID NOTHING IT MAY HELP YOU TO SEE THIS AFFAIR FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ANGLE IF I TELL YOU THAT TWICE TODAY MISS SEYFFERT HAS ASKED ME IF YOU WERE A MARRIED MAN AND OF COURSE YOU TOLD HER I WAS
7067-76047-0006 ON THE SECOND OCCASION SIR RICHMOND SMILED AGAIN FRANKLY SAID THE DOCTOR THIS ADVENTURE IS ALTOGETHER UNCONGENIAL TO ME IT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN MY LIFE THIS HIGHWAY COUPLING
7067-76047-0007 DON'T YOU THINK SAID SIR RICHMOND THAT YOU ARE ATTACHING RATHER TOO MUCH WHAT SHALL I SAY ROMANTIC FLIRTATIOUS MEANING TO THIS AFFAIR
7067-76047-0008 BUT ISN'T YOUR ATTITUDE RATHER UNFAIR UNJUST INDEED AND ALMOST INSULTING TO THIS MISS GRAMMONT AFTER ALL SHE'S A YOUNG LADY OF VERY GOOD SOCIAL POSITION INDEED
7067-76047-0009 SHE DOESN'T STRIKE YOU DOES SHE AS AN UNDIGNIFIED OR HELPLESS HUMAN BEING HER MANNERS SUGGEST A PERSON OF CONSIDERABLE SELF CONTROL AND KNOWING LESS OF ME THAN YOU DO SHE PROBABLY REGARDS ME AS ALMOST AS SAFE AS A MAIDEN AUNT SAY
7067-76047-0010 I'M TWICE HER AGE WE ARE A PARTY OF FOUR THERE ARE CONVENTIONS THERE ARE CONSIDERATIONS AREN'T YOU REALLY MY DEAR MARTINEAU OVERDOING ALL THIS SIDE OF THIS VERY PLEASANT LITTLE ENLARGEMENT OF OUR INTERESTS
7067-76047-0011 AM I SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND BROUGHT A SCRUTINIZING EYE TO BEAR ON SIR RICHMOND'S FACE I WANT TO GO ON TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT FOR A DAY OR SO SIR RICHMOND ADMITTED THEN I SHALL PREFER TO LEAVE YOUR PARTY
7067-76047-0012 THERE WERE SOME MOMENTS OF SILENCE I AM REALLY VERY SORRY TO FIND MYSELF IN THIS DILEMMA SAID SIR RICHMOND WITH A NOTE OF GENUINE REGRET IN HIS VOICE IT IS NOT A DILEMMA SAID DOCTOR MARTINEAU WITH A CORRESPONDING LOSS OF ASPERITY
7067-76047-0013 I GRANT YOU WE DISCOVER WE DIFFER UPON A QUESTION OF TASTE AND CONVENIENCE BUT BEFORE I SUGGESTED THIS TRIP I HAD INTENDED TO SPEND A LITTLE TIME WITH MY OLD FRIEND SIR KENELM LATTER AT BOURNEMOUTH NOTHING SIMPLER THAN TO GO TO HIM NOW
7067-76047-0014 I SHALL BE SORRY ALL THE SAME I COULD HAVE WISHED SAID THE DOCTOR THAT THESE LADIES HAD HAPPENED A LITTLE LATER THE MATTER WAS SETTLED NOTHING MORE OF A PRACTICAL NATURE REMAINED TO BE SAID
7067-76047-0015 BUT NEITHER GENTLEMAN WISHED TO BREAK OFF WITH A HARSH AND BARE DECISION WHEN THE NEW AGE IS HERE SAID SIR RICHMOND THEN SURELY A FRIENDSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN WILL NOT BE SUBJECTED TO THE THE INCONVENIENCES YOUR PRESENT CODE WOULD SET ABOUT IT
7067-76047-0016 AND HONOUR THAN THEY HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE IN MATTERS OF PROPERTY ECONOMICS AND PUBLIC CONDUCT IT WILL PROBABLY BE JUST THE REVERSE THEN THERE WILL BE MUCH MORE COLLECTIVE CONTROL AND MUCH MORE INSISTENCE LEGAL INSISTENCE UPON INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY
7067-76047-0017 BUT WE ARE NOT LIVING IN A NEW AGE YET WE ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP RUINS OF A VERY OLD ONE AND YOU IF YOU WILL FORGIVE ME ARE LIVING IN THE PATCHED UP REMAINS OF A LIFE THAT HAD ALREADY HAD ITS COMPLICATIONS
7067-76047-0018 THIS YOUNG LADY WHOSE CHARM AND CLEVERNESS I ADMIT BEHAVES AS IF THE NEW AGE WERE ALREADY HERE WELL THAT MAY BE A VERY DANGEROUS MISTAKE BOTH FOR HER AND FOR YOU THIS AFFAIR IF IT GOES ON FOR A FEW DAYS MORE
7067-76047-0019 MAY INVOLVE VERY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES INDEED WITH WHICH I FOR ONE DO NOT WISH TO BE INVOLVED SIR RICHMOND UPON THE HEARTHRUG HAD A CURIOUS FEELING THAT HE WAS BACK IN THE HEAD MASTER'S STUDY AT CAXTON
7067-76047-0020 AND IN MANY WAYS INTERESTING I HAVE BEEN WATCHING HER I HAVE NOT BEEN FAVOURED WITH VERY MUCH OF HER ATTENTION BUT THAT FACT HAS ENABLED ME TO SEE HER IN PROFILE
7067-76047-0021 MISS SEYFFERT IS A FAIRLY CRUDE MIXTURE OF FRANKNESS INSINCERITY AND SELF EXPLANATORY EGOTISM AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DISREGARD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF THE CONVERSATION SHE HAS ADDRESSED TO ME
7067-76047-0022 NOW I GUESS THIS MISS GRAMMONT HAS HAD NO MOTHER SINCE SHE WAS QUITE LITTLE YOUR GUESSES DOCTOR ARE APT TO BE PRETTY GOOD SAID SIR RICHMOND YOU KNOW THAT SHE HAS TOLD ME AS MUCH
7067-76047-0023 WELL SHE IMPRESSED ME AS HAVING THE AIR OF A GIRL WHO HAS HAD TO SOLVE MANY PROBLEMS FOR WHICH THE NORMAL MOTHER PROVIDES READY MADE SOLUTIONS THAT IS HOW I INFERRED THAT THERE WAS NO MOTHER I DON'T THINK THERE HAS BEEN ANY STEPMOTHER
7067-76047-0024 HER MANNER WITH MISS SEYFFERT AN EXCELLENT MANNER FOR MISS SEYFFERT BY THE BYE ISN'T THE SORT OF MANNER ANYONE ACQUIRES IN A DAY OR FOR ONE PERSON ONLY SHE IS A VERY SURE AND COMMANDING YOUNG WOMAN SIR RICHMOND NODDED
7067-76047-0025 I SUPPOSE HER FATHER ADORES AND NEGLECTS HER AND WHENEVER SHE HAS WANTED A COMPANION OR GOVERNESS BUTCHERED THE THING HAS BEEN DONE THESE BUSINESS AMERICANS I AM TOLD NEGLECT THEIR WOMENKIND GIVE THEM MONEY AND POWER LET THEM LOOSE ON THE WORLD
7067-76047-0026 IT IS A SORT OF MORAL LAZINESS MASQUERADING AS AFFECTION STILL I SUPPOSE CUSTOM AND TRADITION KEPT THIS GIRL IN HER PLACE AND SHE WAS PETTED HONOURED AMUSED
7067-76047-0027 TALKED ABOUT BUT NOT IN A HARMFUL WAY AND RATHER BORED RIGHT UP TO THE TIME WHEN AMERICA CAME INTO THE WAR THEORETICALLY SHE HAD A TREMENDOUSLY GOOD TIME I THINK THIS MUST BE NEAR THE TRUTH OF HER BIOGRAPHY SAID SIR RICHMOND
7067-76047-0028 I MEAN THAT SHE WAS SURROUNDED BY A RETINUE OF MEN WHO WANTED TO MARRY HER OR WHO BEHAVED AS THOUGH THEY WANTED TO MARRY HER OR WHO MADE HER HAPPINESS AND HER GRATIFICATIONS AND HER CONDESCENSIONS SEEM A MATTER OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THEM
7067-76047-0029 SHE HAD THE FLATTERY OF AN EXTREMELY UNCRITICAL AND UNEXACTING ADMIRATION THAT IS THE SORT OF THING THAT GRATIFIES A SILLY WOMAN EXTREMELY MISS GRAMMONT IS NOT SILLY
7067-76047-0030 PROBABLY BORED HER MORE THAN SHE REALIZED TO ANYONE TOO INTELLIGENT TO BE STEADILY EXCITED BY BUYING THINGS AND WEARING THINGS AND DANCING AND PLAYING GAMES AND GOING TO PLACES OF ENTERTAINMENT AND BEING GIVEN FLOWERS SWEETS JEWELLERY
7067-76047-0031 AND THAT SHE HAD ALREADY READ AND THOUGHT RATHER MORE THAN MOST YOUNG WOMEN IN HER POSITION BEFORE SHE WAS TWENTY I GUESS SHE WAS ALREADY LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE INTERESTING IN THE WAY OF MEN THAN A RICH ADMIRER WITH AN AUTOMOBILE FULL OF PRESENTS THOSE WHO SEEK FIND
7067-76047-0032 WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE FOUND WHAT WOULD A RICH GIRL FIND OUT THERE IN AMERICA I DON'T KNOW I HAVEN'T THE MATERIAL TO GUESS WITH IN LONDON A GIRL MIGHT FIND A CONSIDERABLE VARIETY OF ACTIVE INTERESTING MEN RISING POLITICIANS UNIVERSITY MEN OF DISTINCTION
7067-76047-0033 SHE WOULD FIND THAT LIFE WAS WORTH WHILE TO SUCH PEOPLE IN A WAY THAT MADE THE ORDINARY ENTERTAINMENTS AND AMUSEMENTS OF HER LIFE A MONSTROUS SILLY WASTE OF TIME WITH THE FACILITY OF HER SEX SHE WOULD PICK UP FROM ONE OF THEM THE IDEA THAT MADE LIFE WORTH WHILE FOR HIM
7067-76047-0034 HARSH EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE AND VERY PROFOUND MENTAL DISTURBANCE THERE HAVE BEEN LOVE EXPERIENCES EXPERIENCES THAT WERE SOMETHING MORE THAN THE TREATS AND ATTENTIONS AND PROPOSALS THAT MADE UP HER LIFE WHEN SHE WAS SHELTERED OVER THERE
7067-76047-0035 AND SOMETHING MORE THAN THAT WHAT IT IS I DON'T KNOW THE WAR HAS TURNED AN UGLY FACE TO HER SHE HAS SEEN DEATH AND SUFFERING AND RUIN PERHAPS SHE HAS SEEN PEOPLE SHE KNEW KILLED PERHAPS THE MAN HAS BEEN KILLED
7067-76047-0036 OR SHE HAS MET WITH COWARDICE OR CRUELTY OR TREACHERY WHERE SHE DIDN'T EXPECT IT SHE HAS BEEN SHOCKED OUT OF THE FIRST CONFIDENCE OF YOUTH SHE HAS CEASED TO TAKE THE WORLD FOR GRANTED IT HASN'T BROKEN HER BUT IT HAS MATURED HER
7067-76047-0037 THAT I THINK IS WHY HISTORY HAS BECOME REAL TO HER WHICH SO ATTRACTS YOU IN HER HISTORY FOR HER HAS CEASED TO BE A FABRIC OF PICTURESQUE INCIDENTS IT IS THE STUDY OF A TRAGIC STRUGGLE THAT STILL GOES ON
7067-76047-0038 SHE SEES HISTORY AS YOU SEE IT AND I SEE IT SHE IS A VERY GROWN UP YOUNG WOMAN IT'S JUST THAT SAID SIR RICHMOND IT'S JUST THAT IF YOU SEE AS MUCH IN MISS GRAMMONT AS ALL THAT WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO COME ON WITH US YOU SEE THE INTEREST OF HER
7067-76047-0039 I SEE A LOT MORE THAN THAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT AN ADVANTAGE IT IS TO BE AS I AM RATHER COLD AND UNRESPONSIVE TO WOMEN AND UNATTRACTIVE AND NEGLIGIBLE NEGLIGIBLE THAT IS THE EXACT WORD TO THEM YOU CAN'T LOOK AT A WOMAN FOR FIVE MINUTES
7067-76047-0040 SEEMS TO IMPLY NECESSARILY A CERTAIN IMAGINATIVE FIXITY MISS GRAMMONT HAS AN IMPULSIVE AND ADVENTUROUS CHARACTER AND AS I HAVE BEEN SAYING SHE WAS A SPOILT CHILD WITH NO DISCIPLINE
7067-76047-0041 YOU ALSO ARE A PERSON OF HIGH INTELLIGENCE AND DEFECTIVE CONTROLS SHE IS VERY MUCH AT LOOSE ENDS YOU ON ACCOUNT OF THE ILLNESS OF THAT RATHER FORGOTTEN LADY MISS MARTIN LEEDS
7067-76047-0042 YOU I SAY ARE ALSO AT LOOSE ENDS CAN YOU DENY IT MY DEAR SIR DON'T WE BOTH KNOW THAT EVER SINCE WE LEFT LONDON YOU HAVE BEEN READY TO FALL IN LOVE WITH ANY PRETTY THING IN PETTICOATS THAT SEEMED TO PROMISE YOU THREE HA'PORTH OF KINDNESS
7067-76047-0043 GROTESQUELY HAPPEN HE SAID SHE KNOWS NOTHING OF MARTIN LEEDS YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT AND THEN HE ADDED IF SHE AND YOU FALL IN LOVE
7067-76047-0044 AS THE PHRASE GOES WHAT IS TO FOLLOW THERE WAS A PAUSE SIR RICHMOND LOOKED AT HIS TOES FOR A MOMENT OR SO AS IF HE TOOK COUNSEL WITH THEM AND THEN DECIDED TO TAKE OFFENCE
7067-76047-0045 REALLY HE SAID THIS IS PREPOSTEROUS YOU TALK OF FALLING IN LOVE AS THOUGH IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR A MAN AND WOMAN TO BE DEEPLY INTERESTED IN EACH OTHER WITHOUT THAT AND THE GULF IN OUR AGES IN OUR QUALITY
7067-76047-0046 FROM THE PSYCHOLOGIST OF A NEW AGE I FIND THIS AMAZING ARE MEN AND WOMEN TO GO ON FOR EVER SEPARATED BY THIS POSSIBILITY INTO TWO HARDLY COMMUNICATING AND YET INTERPENETRATING WORLDS
7067-76047-0047 IS THERE NEVER TO BE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN WITHOUT PASSION YOU OUGHT TO KNOW EVEN BETTER THAN I DO THAT THERE IS NOT FOR SUCH PEOPLE AS YOU TWO ANYHOW
7067-76047-0048 AND AT PRESENT THE WORLD IS NOT PREPARED TO TOLERATE FRIENDSHIP AND COMPANIONSHIP WITH THAT ACCOMPANIMENT THAT IS THE CORE OF THIS SITUATION A PAUSE FELL BETWEEN THE TWO GENTLEMEN
7067-76047-0049 THEY HAD SMOOTHED OVER THE EXTREME HARSHNESS OF THEIR SEPARATION AND THERE WAS VERY LITTLE MORE TO BE SAID WELL SAID SIR RICHMOND IN CONCLUSION I AM VERY SORRY INDEED MARTINEAU
7067-76048-0000 I LEAVE YOU TO IT HIS ROUND FACE BETRAYED LITTLE OR NO VESTIGES OF HIS OVERNIGHT IRRITATION OUGHT YOU TO LEAVE ME TO IT SMILED SIR RICHMOND I SHALL BE INTERESTED TO LEARN WHAT HAPPENS BUT IF YOU WON'T STAY TO SEE
7067-76048-0001 NOW SIR PLEASE SAID THE GUARD RESPECTFULLY BUT FIRMLY AND DOCTOR MARTINEAU GOT IN SIR RICHMOND WALKED THOUGHTFULLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS THE EXIT WHAT ELSE COULD I DO HE ASKED ALOUD TO NOBODY IN PARTICULAR
7067-76048-0002 SECTION TWO FOR THE BETTER PART OF FORTY HOURS SIR RICHMOND HAD EITHER BEEN TALKING TO MISS GRAMMONT OR CARRYING ON IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH HER IN HER ABSENCE
7067-76048-0003 AND SHE REPEATED NO REMEMBERED COMMENTS AND PROPHETS OF HER CONTEMPORARIES ABOUT HERSELF SHE EITHER CONCEALED OR SHE HAD LOST ANY GREAT INTEREST IN HER OWN PERSONALITY
7067-76048-0004 BUT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN AND CURIOUS ABOUT THE PEOPLE SHE HAD MET IN LIFE AND HER TALK OF THEM REFLECTED A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF LIGHT UPON HER OWN UPBRINGING AND EXPERIENCES AND HER LIKING FOR SIR RICHMOND WAS PLEASINGLY MANIFEST
7067-76048-0005 SHE LIKED HIS TURN OF THOUGHT SHE WATCHED HIM WITH A FAINT SMILE ON HER LIPS AS HE SPOKE AND SHE SPREAD HER OPINIONS BEFORE HIM CAREFULLY IN THAT SOFT VOICE OF HERS LIKE A SHY CHILD SHOWING ITS TREASURES TO SOME SUDDENLY TRUSTED AND FAVOURED VISITOR
7067-76048-0006 AS A CRISIS IN WHICH THEY WERE CALLED UPON TO DO SOMETHING THEY DID NOT YET CLEARLY KNOW WHAT INTO THIS TOPIC THEY PEERED AS INTO SOME DEEP POOL SIDE BY SIDE AND IN IT THEY SAW EACH OTHER REFLECTED
7067-76048-0007 ITS DELIGHT WAS PARTICULARLY MANIFEST IN THE CREAM AND SALAD IT PRODUCED FOR LUNCH BOTH MISS GRAMMONT AND MISS SEYFFERT DISPLAYED AN INTELLIGENT INTEREST IN THEIR FOOD AFTER LUNCH THEY HAD ALL GONE OUT TO THE STONES AND THE WALL
7067-76048-0008 TO A HAPPY USE BY CLAMBERING TO THE TOP OF IT AND SLIDING ON THEIR LITTLE BEHINDS DOWN ITS SMOOTH AND SLOPING SIDE AMIDST MUCH MIRTHFUL SQUEALING
7067-76048-0009 SIR RICHMOND AND MISS GRAMMONT HAD WALKED ROUND THE OLD CIRCUMVALLATION TOGETHER BUT BELINDA SEYFFERT HAD STRAYED AWAY FROM THEM PROFESSING AN INTEREST IN FLOWERS
7067-76048-0010 THAT IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE TO TAKE THIS CONFUSED OLD WORLD AND RESHAPE IT SET IT MARCHING TOWARDS THAT NEW WORLD OF YOURS OF TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FULLY DEVELOPED BEAUTIFUL AND HAPPY PEOPLE WHY NOT
7067-76048-0011 NOBODY IS DOING ANYTHING WITH THE WORLD EXCEPT MUDDLE ABOUT WHY NOT GIVE IT A DIRECTION YOU'D TAKE IT IN YOUR HANDS LIKE CLAY OBDURATE CLAY WITH A SORT OF RECALCITRANT UNINTELLIGENT LIFE OF ITS OWN
7067-76048-0012 HER IMAGINATION GLOWED IN HER EYES AND WARMED HER VOICE I BELIEVE WHAT YOU SAY IS POSSIBLE IF PEOPLE DARE I AM TIRED OF FOLLOWING LITTLE MOTIVES THAT ARE LIKE FLAMES THAT GO OUT WHEN YOU GET TO THEM
7067-76048-0013 I AM TIRED OF SEEING ALL THE WORLD DOING THE SAME I AM TIRED OF A WORLD IN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING GREAT BUT GREAT DISASTERS HERE IS SOMETHING MANKIND CAN ATTEMPT THAT WE CAN ATTEMPT AND WILL I BELIEVE THAT AS MANKIND GROWS UP
7067-76048-0014 AND PRIDE OURSELVES UPON OUR FREEDOM FROM THE SIN OF PRESUMPTION NOT QUITE THAT WELL HOW DO YOU PUT IT WE ARE AFRAID SHE SAID IT'S TOO VAST WE WANT BRIGHT LITTLE LIVES OF OUR OWN
7067-76048-0015 SENSIBLE LITTLE PIGGY WIGGYS WE HAVE A RIGHT TO LIFE AND HAPPINESS FIRST SAID SIR RICHMOND AS MUCH RIGHT AS A PIG HAS TO FOOD BUT WHETHER WE GET LIFE AND HAPPINESS OR FAIL TO GET THEM WE HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0016 WHO HAVE IMAGINATIONS WANT SOMETHING MORE NOWADAYS OF COURSE WE WANT BRIGHT LIVES OF COURSE WE WANT HAPPINESS JUST AS WE WANT FOOD JUST AS WE WANT SLEEP BUT WHEN WE HAVE EATEN WHEN WE HAVE SLEPT WHEN WE HAVE JOLLY THINGS ABOUT US IT IS NOTHING
7067-76048-0017 WE HAVE BEEN MADE AN EXCEPTION OF AND GOT OUR RATIONS THE BIG THING CONFRONTS US STILL
7067-76048-0018 I DO NOT KNOW WHY IT SHOULD BE SO BUT I AM COMPELLED BY SOMETHING IN MY NATURE TO WANT TO SERVE THIS IDEA OF A NEW AGE FOR MANKIND I WANT IT AS MY CULMINATING WANT I WANT A WORLD IN ORDER
7067-76048-0019 A DISCIPLINED MANKIND GOING ON TO GREATER THINGS DON'T YOU NOW YOU TELL ME OF IT SHE SAID WITH A SMILE I DO BUT BEFORE NO YOU'VE MADE IT CLEAR IT WASN'T CLEAR BEFORE
7067-76048-0020 I'VE BEEN TALKING OF THIS SORT OF THING WITH MY FRIEND DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND I'VE BEEN THINKING AS WELL AS TALKING THAT PERHAPS IS WHY I'M SO CLEAR AND POSITIVE I DON'T COMPLAIN THAT YOU ARE CLEAR AND POSITIVE I'VE BEEN COMING ALONG THE SAME WAY
7067-76048-0021 IT'S REFRESHING TO MEET YOU I FOUND IT REFRESHING TO MEET MARTINEAU A TWINGE OF CONSCIENCE ABOUT DOCTOR MARTINEAU TURNED SIR RICHMOND INTO A NEW CHANNEL HE'S A MOST INTERESTING MAN HE SAID RATHER SHY IN SOME RESPECTS
7067-76048-0022 DEVOTED TO HIS WORK AND HE'S WRITING A BOOK WHICH HAS SATURATED HIM IN THESE IDEAS ONLY TWO NIGHTS AGO WE STOOD HERE AND TALKED ABOUT IT THE PSYCHOLOGY OF A NEW AGE THE WORLD HE BELIEVES IS ENTERING UPON A NEW PHASE IN ITS HISTORY
7067-76048-0023 THE ADOLESCENCE SO TO SPEAK OF MANKIND IT IS AN IDEA THAT SEIZES THE IMAGINATION THERE IS A FLOW OF NEW IDEAS ABROAD HE THINKS WIDENING REALIZATIONS UNPRECEDENTED HOPES AND FEARS
7067-76048-0024 THERE IS A CONSCIOUSNESS OF NEW POWERS AND NEW RESPONSIBILITIES WE ARE SHARING THE ADOLESCENCE OF OUR RACE IT IS GIVING HISTORY A NEW AND MORE INTIMATE MEANING FOR US
7067-76048-0025 MAKING THEM MATTER AS FORMERLY THEY DIDN'T SEEM TO MATTER THAT IDEA OF THE BRIGHT LITTLE PRIVATE LIFE HAS TO GO BY THE BOARD I SUPPOSE IT HAS SHE SAID MEDITATIVELY AS THOUGH SHE HAD BEEN THINKING OVER SOME SUCH QUESTION BEFORE
7067-76048-0026 INCIDENTALLY HE SMILED I WANT TO GET A LASSO OVER THE NECK OF THAT VERY FORCIBLE AND BARBARIC PERSON YOUR FATHER I AM DOING MY BEST TO HELP LAY THE FOUNDATION OF A SCIENTIFIC WORLD CONTROL OF FUEL PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
7067-76048-0027 BUT CONTROLLING FATHER AS DISTINGUISHED FROM MANAGING HIM SHE REVIEWED SOME PRIVATE AND AMUSING MEMORIES HE IS A MOST INTRACTABLE MAN SECTION THREE
7067-76048-0028 THEY HAD GONE ON TO TALK OF HER FATHER AND OF THE TYPES OF MEN WHO CONTROLLED INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS SHE HAD HAD PLENTIFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR OBSERVATION IN THEIR HOMES AND HER OWN
7067-76048-0029 GUNTER LAKE THE BIG BANKER SHE KNEW PARTICULARLY WELL BECAUSE IT SEEMED SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED OR WAS ENGAGED TO MARRY HIM ALL THESE PEOPLE SHE SAID ARE PUSHING THINGS ABOUT AFFECTING MILLIONS OF LIVES
7067-76048-0030 YOU WILL FIND MY FATHER EXTREMELY DIFFICULT BUT SOME OF OUR YOUNGER MEN WOULD LOVE IT AND SHE WENT ON THERE ARE AMERICAN WOMEN WHO'D LOVE IT TOO WE'RE PETTED WE'RE KEPT OUT OF THINGS WE AREN'T PLACED
7067-76048-0031 WE DON'T GET ENOUGH TO DO WE'RE SPENDERS AND WASTERS NOT ALWAYS FROM CHOICE WHILE THESE FATHERS AND BROTHERS AND HUSBANDS OF OURS PLAY ABOUT WITH THE FUEL AND POWER AND LIFE AND HOPE OF THE WORLD AS THOUGH IT WAS A GAME OF POKER
7067-76048-0032 WITH ALL THE EMPTY UNSPEAKABLE SOLEMNITY OF THE MALE AND TREAT US AS THOUGH WE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED IF THEY BRING HOME PART OF THE WINNINGS THAT CAN'T GO ON SHE SAID HER EYES WENT BACK TO THE LONG LOW UNDULATING SKYLINE OF THE DOWNS
7067-76048-0033 SHE SPOKE AS THOUGH SHE TOOK UP THE THREAD OF SOME CONTROVERSY THAT HAD PLAYED A LARGE PART IN HER LIFE THAT ISN'T GOING ON SHE SAID WITH AN EFFECT OF CONCLUSIVE DECISION
7067-76048-0034 SIR RICHMOND RECALLED THAT LITTLE SPEECH NOW AS HE RETURNED FROM SALISBURY STATION TO THE OLD GEORGE AFTER HIS FAREWELL TO MARTINEAU HE RECALLED TOO THE SOFT FIRMNESS OF HER PROFILE AND THE DELICATE LINE OF HER LIFTED CHIN
7067-76048-0035 HE FELT THAT THIS TIME AT ANY RATE HE WAS NOT BEING DECEIVED BY THE OUTWARD SHOWS OF A CHARMING HUMAN BEING THIS YOUNG WOMAN HAD REAL FIRMNESS OF CHARACTER TO BACK UP HER FREE AND INDEPENDENT JUDGMENTS
7067-76048-0036 IN THE COMPOSITION OF SO SURE AND GALLANT A PERSONALITY MARTINEAU WAS VERY FINE MINDED IN MANY RESPECTS BUT HE WAS AN OLD MAID AND LIKE ALL OLD MAIDS HE SAW MAN AND WOMAN IN EVERY ENCOUNTER
7067-76048-0037 BUT PASSION WAS A THING MEN AND WOMEN FELL BACK UPON WHEN THEY HAD NOTHING ELSE IN COMMON WHEN THEY THOUGHT IN THE PLEASANTEST HARMONY AND EVERY REMARK SEEMED TO WEAVE A FRESH THREAD OF COMMON INTEREST THEN IT WASN'T SO NECESSARY IT MIGHT HAPPEN
7067-76048-0038 HER VIEWS ABOUT AMERICA AND ABOUT HER OWN PLACE IN THE WORLD SEEMED EQUALLY FRESH AND ORIGINAL TO SIR RICHMOND I REALIZE I'VE GOT TO BE A RESPONSIBLE AMERICAN CITIZEN SHE HAD SAID
7067-76048-0039 THAT DIDN'T MEAN THAT SHE ATTACHED VERY MUCH IMPORTANCE TO HER RECENTLY ACQUIRED VOTE SHE EVIDENTLY CLASSIFIED VOTERS INTO THE IRRESPONSIBLE WHO JUST HAD VOTES AND THE RESPONSIBLE WHO ALSO HAD A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PROPERTY AS WELL
7067-76048-0040 SHE HAD NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT THE POWER OF THE FORMER CLASS IT DIDN'T EXIST THEY WERE STEERED TO THEIR DECISIONS BY PEOPLE EMPLOYED DIRECTED OR STIMULATED BY FATHER AND HIS FRIENDS AND ASSOCIATES THE OWNERS OF AMERICA THE REAL RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS
7067-76048-0041 OR THEY FELL A PREY TO THE MERELY ADVENTUROUS LEADING OF REVOLUTIONARIES BUT ANYHOW THEY WERE STEERED SHE HERSELF IT WAS CLEAR WAS BOUND TO BECOME A VERY RESPONSIBLE CITIZEN INDEED
7067-76048-0042 SHE WOULD SOME DAY SHE LAUGHED BE SWIMMING IN OIL AND SUCH LIKE PROPERTY HER INTEREST IN SIR RICHMOND'S SCHEMES FOR A SCIENTIFIC WORLD MANAGEMENT OF FUEL WAS THEREFORE SHE REALIZED A VERY DIRECT ONE BUT IT WAS REMARKABLE TO FIND A YOUNG WOMAN SEEING IT LIKE THAT
7067-76048-0043 FATHER IT SEEMED VARIED VERY MUCH IN HIS ATTITUDE TOWARDS HER HE DESPISED AND DISTRUSTED WOMEN GENERALLY AND IT WAS EVIDENT HE HAD MADE IT QUITE CLEAR TO HER HOW GRAVE AN ERROR IT WAS ON HER PART TO PERSIST IN BEING A DAUGHTER AND NOT A SON
7067-76048-0044 AT MOMENTS IT SEEMED TO SIR RICHMOND THAT SHE WAS DISPOSED TO AGREE WITH FATHER UPON THAT WHEN MISTER GRAMMONT'S SENSE OF HER REGRETTABLE FEMININITY WAS UPPERMOST
7067-76048-0045 AND THEN HE WOULD DIRECT HIS ATTENTION TO A KIND OF MASCULINIZATION OF HIS DAUGHTER AND TO SCHEMES FOR GIVING HER THE COMPLETEST CONTROL OF ALL HE HAD TO LEAVE HER PROVIDED SHE NEVER MARRIED NOR FELL UNDER MASCULINE SWAY AFTER ALL
7067-76048-0046 HE WOULD REFLECT AS HE HESITATED OVER THE PRACTICABILITY OF HIS LIFE'S IDEAL THERE WAS HETTY GREEN THIS LATTER IDEA HAD REFT HER SUDDENLY AT THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN FROM THE EDUCATIONAL CARE OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEWOMAN WARRANTED TO FIT HER FOR MARRIAGE WITH ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
7067-76048-0047 AFTER A SWIFT BUT COMPETENT TRAINING INTO A SHIRT WAIST AND AN OFFICE DOWN TOWN SHE HAD BEEN ENTRUSTED AT FIRST TO A HARVESTER CONCERN INDEPENDENT OF MISTER GRAMMONT BECAUSE HE FEARED HIS OWN PEOPLE WOULDN'T TRAIN HER HARD
7067-76048-0048 SHE HAD WORKED FOR ORDINARY WAGES AND ORDINARY HOURS AND AT THE END OF THE DAY SHE MENTIONED CASUALLY A LARGE AUTOMOBILE WITH TWO MENSERVANTS
7067-76048-0049 THIS MASCULINIZATION IDEA HAD ALSO SENT HER ON A COMMISSION OF ENQUIRY INTO MEXICO THERE APPARENTLY SHE HAD REALLY DONE RESPONSIBLE WORK BUT UPON THE QUESTION OF LABOUR MISTER GRAMMONT WAS FIERCE
7067-76048-0050 HE DISCOVERED HIS DAUGHTER DISPLAYING WHAT HE CONSIDERED AN IMPROPER FAMILIARITY WITH SOCIALIST IDEAS
7067-76048-0051 AND THE IDEA OF A MATRIMONIAL ALLIANCE WITH GUNTER LAKE GUNTER LAKE SIR RICHMOND GATHERED WASN'T HALF A BAD FELLOW GENERALLY IT WOULD SEEM MISS GRAMMONT LIKED HIM AND SHE HAD A WAY OF SPEAKING ABOUT HIM THAT SUGGESTED THAT IN SOME WAY
7067-76048-0052 MISTER LAKE HAD BEEN RATHER HARDLY USED AND HAD ACQUIRED MERIT BY HIS BEHAVIOUR UNDER BAD TREATMENT THERE WAS SOME STORY HOWEVER CONNECTED WITH HER WAR SERVICES IN EUROPE UPON WHICH MISS GRAMMONT WAS EVIDENTLY INDISPOSED TO DWELL
7067-76048-0053 STILL QUITE VAGUELY GUESSING SO MUCH FACT ABOUT MISS GRAMMONT AS WE HAVE GIVEN HAD FLOATED UP IN FRAGMENTS AND PIECED ITSELF TOGETHER IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND IN THE COURSE OF A DAY AND A HALF THE FRAGMENTS CAME UP AS ALLUSIONS OR BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION
7067-76048-0054 THE SUSTAINING TOPIC WAS THIS NEW AGE SIR RICHMOND FORE SHADOWED THIS WORLD UNDER SCIENTIFIC CONTROL THE UTOPIA OF FULLY DEVELOPED PEOPLE FULLY DEVELOPING THE RESOURCES OF THE EARTH
7067-76048-0055 FOR A NUMBER OF TRIVIAL REASONS SIR RICHMOND FOUND HIMSELF ASCRIBING THE PROJECT OF THIS NEW AGE ALMOST WHOLLY TO DOCTOR MARTINEAU AND PRESENTING IT AS A MUCH COMPLETER SCHEME THAN HE WAS JUSTIFIED IN DOING IT WAS TRUE THAT DOCTOR MARTINEAU HAD NOT SAID MANY OF THE THINGS SIR RICHMOND ASCRIBED TO HIM
7067-76048-0056 BUT ALSO IT WAS TRUE THAT THEY HAD NOT CRYSTALLIZED OUT IN SIR RICHMOND'S MIND BEFORE HIS TALKS WITH DOCTOR MARTINEAU THE IDEA OF A NEW AGE NECESSARILY CARRIES WITH IT THE IDEA OF FRESH RULES OF CONDUCT AND OF DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HUMAN BEINGS
7067-76048-0057 AND IT THROWS THOSE WHO TALK ABOUT IT INTO THE COMPANIONSHIP OF A COMMON ENTERPRISE TO MORROW THE NEW AGE WILL BE HERE NO DOUBT BUT TODAY IT IS THE HOPE AND ADVENTURE OF ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS SO THAT IT WAS NATURAL FOR MISS GRAMMONT AND SIR RICHMOND TO ASK
7067-76048-0058 WHAT ARE WE TO DO WITH SUCH TYPES AS FATHER AND TO FALL INTO AN IDIOM THAT ASSUMED A JOINT ENTERPRISE THEY HAD AGREED BY A TACIT CONSENT TO A COMMON CONCEPTION OF THE WORLD THEY DESIRED AS A WORLD SCIENTIFICALLY ORDERED
7067-76048-0059 AN IMMENSE ORGANIZATION OF MATURE COMMONSENSE HEALTHY AND SECURE GATHERING KNOWLEDGE AND POWER FOR CREATIVE ADVENTURES AS YET BEYOND DREAMING
7067-76048-0060 AND REPLACEABLE STRUCTURES INDEED BOTH THESE TWO PEOPLE FOUND THEMSELVES THINKING IN THIS FASHION WITH AN UNWONTED COURAGE AND FREEDOM BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE HAD BEEN DISPOSED TO THINK IN THIS FASHION BEFORE
7078-271888-0000 WOMAN'S VANITY OFTEN OUTRUNS HER NATURAL DIFFIDENCE AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HER GREAT BEAUTY STIFLES THE CONSCIENCE OF MODESTY VISITORS TO THE ACADEMY KNOW THE PICTURE CIRCE SEATED
7078-271888-0001 WITH HER BACK TO A GREAT CIRCULAR MIRROR PRESENTS A HALF DRAPED FIGURE OF MARVELLOUS DELICATE COLOURING AND BEAUTY OF OUTLINE ONE HAND HOLDS ALOFT A GOLDEN WINE GOBLET AND THE OTHER A TAPERING WAND
7078-271888-0002 WHILE UPON THE TESSELATED PAVEMENT BEFORE THE DAIS PURPLE GRAPES AND YELLOW ROSES HAVE BEEN STREWN THE BLACK HAIR OF THE DAUGHTER OF PERSEIS FALLS IN PROFUSION ABOUT HER BARE SHOULDERS AND STRAYS OVER HER BREAST
7078-271888-0003 BUT HER FEATURES ARE HIDDEN BY A HALF MASK OF BLACK SILK THE LIPS WITH THEIR ARC DE CUPIDON ARE SLIGHTLY PARTED DISCLOSING AN EVEN ROW OF PEARLY TEETH
7078-271888-0004 OF THE THOUSANDS WHO HAVE GAZED UPON IT IN ADMIRATION NONE KNOWS THE SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE STORY CONNECTED WITH IT AS I HAVE BEEN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH IT FROM THE DAY IT WAS OUTLINED IN CHARCOAL
7078-271888-0005 UNTIL THE EVENING IT WAS PACKED IN A CRATE AND SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE IT IS PERHAPS APROPOS THAT I SHOULD RELATE THE NARRATIVE THE STUDIO OF MY OLD FRIEND DICK CARRUTHERS THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT
7078-271888-0006 IS ON CAMPDEN HILL KENSINGTON WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED YARDS OF WHERE I RESIDE AND IN THE CENTRE OF AN AESTHETIC ARTISTIC COLONY WE HAVE BEEN CHUMS FOR YEARS FOR ON MANY OCCASIONS HE HAS DISPLAYED HIS TALENT AS A BLACK AND WHITE ARTIST
7078-271888-0007 IN ILLUSTRATING MY ARTICLES AND STORIES IN VARIOUS MAGAZINES HE IS A POPULAR PAINTER AND AS HANDSOME A MAN AS EVER HAD A PICTURE ON THE LINE THREE YEARS AGO WHEN THE PROLOGUE OF THIS SECRET DRAMA WAS ENACTED
7078-271888-0008 HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF COMING OVER WHEN THE LIGHT HAD FADED TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE AND DISCUSS ART AND LITERATURE WITH ME I WAS GLAD OF A CHAT AFTER A HARD DAY'S WORK AT MY WRITING TABLE BUT HIS COMPANIONSHIP HAD ONE DRAWBACK
7078-271888-0009 HE DRIVELLED OVER A GIRL HE LOVED AND WAS FOREVER SUGGESTING THAT I MIGHT TAKE HER AS A CHARACTER AND DRAG HER INTO THE NOVEL UPON WHICH I WAS ENGAGED ONE DAY HE DREW A CABINET PHOTOGRAPH CAREFULLY FROM HIS POCKET
7078-271888-0010 AND PLACED IT UPON THE BLOTTING PAD BEFORE ME THE GIRL HE LOVED BAH I KNEW HER THOUGH I DID NOT TELL HIM SO SHE WAS A DARK HAIRED PINK AND WHITE BEAUTY THAT FLITTED THROUGH ARTISTIC BOHEMIA LIKE A BUTTERFLY IN A HOTHOUSE
7078-271888-0011 THE SIGHT OF THE PICTURED FACE BROUGHT BACK TO ME THE MEMORY OF DAYS LONG PAST OF A CLOSED CHAPTER IN MY LIFE'S HISTORY I REMEMBERED THE FIRST TIME I SAW ETHEL BROUGHTON FULLY FIVE YEARS BEFORE SHE WORE A SOILED PINK WRAPPER
7078-271888-0012 HER SATIN SLIPPERS WERE TRODDEN DOWN AT HEEL AND SHE HAD A BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE AT HER ELBOW AT THAT TIME HER LOVER GRANDILOQUENT AND IMPECUNIOUS MISTER HARRY ORANMORE A BAD BUT HANDSOME ACTOR HAD BEEN UNTRUE TO HER
7078-271888-0013 AND SHE A THIRD RATE ACTRESS WHO HAD AN INGENUE PART AT A STRAND THEATRE
7078-271888-0014 BUT SHE SCARCELY HEEDED ME PROBABLY SHE WAS THINKING OF ORANMORE FOR SHE CLASPED HER SLIM FINGERS ROUND HER SUFFERING THROAT AND OFFERED UP AN OCCASIONAL SOB FOLLOWING IT WITH A SILENT BUT PROTRACTED DRAUGHT FROM HER GLASS
7078-271888-0015 THE RESULT OF THIS INTERVIEW WAS BUT NATURAL DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY I SYMPATHISED WITH HER ENDEAVOURED TO CHEER HER AND CONCLUDED BY FALLING VIOLENTLY IN LOVE WITH HER AT THAT TIME I WAS WRITING NUMBERS OF DRAMATIC CRITICISMS
7078-271888-0016 AND I CONFESS I USED WHAT WEIGHT MY OPINIONS POSSESSED FOR THE PURPOSE OF HER ADVANCEMENT IT IS NEEDLESS TO REFER TO THE SMOOTH AND UNINTERRUPTED COURSE OF OUR LOVE SUFFICE IT TO SAY THAT WE WERE BOTH BOHEMIANS
7078-271888-0017 AND THAT WITHIN A YEAR I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF SITTING BEFORE THE FOOTLIGHTS WATCHING HER MAKE HER DEBUT AS LEADING LADY AT A WEST END THEATRE AND A FEW DAYS LATER OF OBSERVING HER PHOTOGRAPH EXHIBITED IN SHOP WINDOWS AMONG THOSE OF OTHER STAGE BEAUTIES
7078-271888-0018 BUT ALAS THOSE HALCYON DAYS WERE ALL TOO BRIEF SUDDENLY THE SCALES FELL FROM MY EYES A SCENE OCCURRED BETWEEN US AND WE PARTED TO THINK THAT SIN SHOULD LIE FOR YEARS IN THE BLOOD
7078-271888-0019 JUST AS ARSENIC DOES IN A CORPSE WHEN I DISCOVERED THAT DICK CARRUTHERS WAS WASTING THE VERY HONEST AND ARDENT EMOTIONS OF HIS HEART AT THIS FEVERISH FAIRY'S SHRINE I RESOLVED TO TAKE HIM ASIDE AND WITHOUT ADMITTING THAT I KNEW HER
7078-271888-0020 GIVE HIM A VERBAL DRUBBING I DID SO BUT HE BIT HIS MOUSTACHE FIERCELY AND TURNED UPON ME SHE IS CHARMING HE SAID AND I LOVE HER AH I KNOW THE TYPE
7078-271888-0021 YOU KNOW NOTHING OLD FELLOW HE EXCLAIMED FLUSHING ANGRILY BUT HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS
7078-271888-0022 YOU SHALL SEE HER BEFORE LONG HIS GAZE GREW BRIGHT SOFT AND VAGUE AS ONE WHO CATCHES GLIMPSES OF THE FLOATING GARMENTS OF SUPERNATURAL MYSTERIES AH SHE IS LOVELY ONLY AN ARTIST CAN APPRECIATE HER BEAUTY
7078-271888-0023 HEEDLESS OF EVERYTHING UNDER THE SPELL SHE HAD CAST ABOUT HIM ONE NIGHT NOT LONG AFTER I HAD EXPRESSED MY SENTIMENTS TO HIM REGARDING HIS INFATUATION I ENTERED HIS STUDIO AND FOUND HIS GODDESS SEATED BY THE FIRE WITH HER SHAPELY FEET UPON THE FENDER
7078-271888-0024 AND HOLDING A LIGHTED CIGARETTE BETWEEN HER DAINTY FINGERS DICK FLUNG DOWN HIS PALETTE AND CAME FORWARD TO INTRODUCE ME HER DARK EYES MET MINE AND WE TACITLY AGREED NOT TO RECOGNISE EACH OTHER THEREFORE WE BOWED AS PERFECT STRANGERS
7078-271888-0025 I CAUGHT HER GLANCING FURTIVELY AT ME UNDER HER LONG LASHES SHE HAD GROWN EVEN HANDSOMER THAN WHEN LAST I HAD SEEN HER AND WAS THE PICTURE OF THE ROMANTIC BOHEMIENNE HER DRESS WAS OF BLACK GAUZE THROUGH WHICH THE MILKY WHITENESS OF HER FIGURE SEEMED TO SHINE
7078-271888-0026 YET AS SHE TURNED HER BEAUTIFUL FACE TOWARDS ME I WAS STRUCK BY THE COMPLETE EFFECT OF PHYSICAL AND MORAL FRAILTY THAT SHE PRESENTED SHE EXPRESSED PLEASURE AT MEETING ME REMARKING THAT SHE HAD READ MY LAST NOVEL AND HAD BEEN KEENLY INTERESTED IN IT
7078-271888-0027 WHEN I HAD BRIEFLY ACKNOWLEDGED THE COMPLIMENT SHE PAID ME SHE SAID ONE THING ALWAYS STRIKES ME IN READING YOUR STORIES YOUR WOMEN ARE INEVITABLY FALSE AND FICKLE PERHAPS HOWEVER YOU WRITE FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
7078-271888-0028 OF THE FAILINGS OF MY SEX SHE LAUGHED GLANCING SHARPLY AT HER I SAW THAT HER EYES DID NOT WAVER IT IS TRUE I ONCE KNEW A WOMAN WHO PROVED FALSE AND INFAMOUS I REPLIED WITH SOME EMPHASIS
7078-271888-0029 AND YOU AVENGE YOURSELF BY REVILING ALL OF US IT IS REALLY TOO BAD SHE SAID POUTING LIKE A SPOILED CHILD BY JOVE OLD FELLOW DICK CHIMED IN DO TELL US ABOUT YOUR ROMANCE IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO KNOW THE REASON
7078-271888-0030 YOU SET YOUR FACE AGAINST ALL THE FAIR ONES BUT I SUCCEEDED IN TURNING THE CONVERSATION INTO ANOTHER CHANNEL
7078-271888-0031 SO MAKING AN EXCUSE I BADE THEM AU REVOIR AND RETURNED TO MY OWN BOOK LINED DEN UNLOCKING A DRAWER IN MY WRITING TABLE I TOOK OUT A PACKET OF LETTERS THAT STILL EMITTED A STALE ODOUR OF VIOLETS
7078-271888-0032 THEN I LIT MY PIPE AND ONE BY ONE READ THEM THROUGH PAUSING AND PONDERING OVER THE DECLARATIONS OF PASSIONATE LOVE THEY CONTAINED FAR INTO THE NIGHT I SAT REVIEWING THE ROMANCE OF BYGONE DAYS UNTIL I CAME TO THE LAST LETTER
7078-271888-0033 IT WAS A COLD FORMAL NOTE MERELY A FEW LINES OF HURRIED SCRAWL AND READ YOU ARE RIGHT I HAVE BEEN FALSE TO YOU THINK NO MORE OF ME BY THE TIME YOU RECEIVE THIS I SHALL BE ON MY WAY TO NEW YORK
7078-271888-0034 NEVERTHELESS YOU WILL BE ALWAYS REMEMBERED BY YOURS UNWORTHILY ETHEL BITTER MEMORIES OF THE PAST OVERWHELMED ME BUT AT LAST GROWING IMPATIENT AND TOSSING THE LETTERS BACK INTO THE DRAWER
7078-271888-0035 I STROVE TO FORGET THE CLOCK HAD STRUCK TWO AND MY READING LAMP WAS BURNING LOW AND SPUTTERING WHEN I ROSE TO RETIRE FOR THE NIGHT I CONFESS THAT MY FRAME OF MIND SURPRISED ME INASMUCH AS I ACTUALLY FOUND MYSELF
7078-271888-0036 STILL LOVING HER GOOD AFTERNOON I HOPE I DON'T DISTURB YOU LOOKING UP FROM MY WORK I SAW ETHEL NOT AT ALL PRAY SIT DOWN I SAID COLDLY
7078-271888-0037 MOTIONING HER TO AN ARMCHAIR TO WHAT DO I OWE THE HONOUR OF THIS VISIT SHE PULLED OFF HER LONG GLOVES AND LET HER SEALSKIN CAPE FALL AT HER FEET WHILE I PUT DOWN MY PEN AND RISING STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE FIRE
7078-271888-0038 WITH HER SHE HAD BROUGHT THE ODOUR OF VIOLETS THE SAME THAT I REMEMBERED YEARS AGO THE SAME PERFUME THAT ALWAYS STIRRED SAD MEMORIES WITHIN ME YOU DON'T WELCOME ME VERY WARMLY SHE SAID IN A DISAPPOINTED TONE
7078-271888-0039 AS SHE GRASPED MY HAND AND LOOKED STEADILY INTO MY EYES NO I SAID STERNLY LAST NIGHT I TOLD YOU THAT A WOMAN HAD EMBITTERED MY LIFE THE WOMAN I REFERRED TO WAS YOURSELF AH
7078-271888-0040 SHE SAID STRIVING TO SUPPRESS A SOB FORGIVE ME I I WAS MAD THEN I LOVED YOU BUT I DID NOT APPREHEND THE CONSEQUENCE LOVE WHAT NONSENSE TO SPEAK OF IT WHEN THROUGH YOUR BASENESS
7078-271888-0041 I HAVE BEEN ALMOST RUINED THINK OF YOUR ACTIONS ON THE DAY BEFORE YOU LEFT ME HOW YOU TOOK FROM THAT DRAWER A SIGNED BLANK CHEQUE WITH WHICH YOU DREW SIX HUNDRED POUNDS NEARLY ALL THE MONEY I POSSESSED AND THEN FLED WITH YOUR LOVER
7078-271888-0042 IS THAT THE WAY A WOMAN SHOWS HER AFFECTION HER HEAD WAS BOWED IN HUMILIATION FORGIVE ME HAROLD SHE SAID WITH INTENSE EARNESTNESS I ADMIT THAT I WRONGED YOU CRUELLY THAT I DISCARDED THE HONEST LOVE YOU GAVE ME
7078-271888-0043 BUT YOU YOU DO NOT KNOW HOW WEAK WE WOMEN ARE WHEN TEMPTATION IS IN OUR PATH CANNOT I NOW MAKE AMENDS I SHOOK MY HEAD SADLY
7078-271888-0044 SHE IMPLORED TEARFULLY AT LEAST I AM HONEST MY OBJECT IN COMING THIS AFTERNOON WAS TO REPAY THE MONEY I I BORROWED
7078-271888-0045 I ASKED HESITATING TO RECEIVE IT I HAVE EARNED IT HONESTLY EVERY PENNY SHE REPLIED SINCE WE PARTED I HAVE BECOME POPULAR IN AMERICA AND PLAYED LEAD IN NEARLY ALL THE GREAT CITIES
7078-271888-0046 DURING THE YEARS THAT HAVE GONE I HAVE MANY MANY TIMES WONDERED WHAT HAD BECOME OF YOU FOR IN YOUR WRITINGS I READ PLAINLY HOW SOURED AND EMBITTERED YOU HAD BECOME AND WHERE IS ORANMORE DEAD
7078-271888-0047 HE CONTRACTED TYPHOID WHILE WE WERE PLAYING IN SAN FRANCISCO AND IT TERMINATED FATALLY ETHEL I SAID GRAVELY TAKING HER HAND IN MINE YOU HAVE FASCINATED DICK CARRUTHERS MY FRIEND
7078-271888-0048 AND YOU WILL TREAT HIM AS YOU TREATED ME NO NO I LOVE HIM SHE SAID IN A FIERCE HALF WHISPER ADDING
7078-271888-0049 I WILL BE TRUE TO HIM IF HE MARRIES ME HE SHALL NEVER HAVE CAUSE FOR REGRET NEVER SUPPOSE I TOLD HIM WHAT WOULD HE THINK OF YOU YOU WILL NOT SHE CRIED CLINGING TO ME YOU ARE TOO HONOURABLE FOR THAT
7078-271888-0050 PROMISE TO KEEP MY SECRET FOR THE PRESENT I WILL PRESERVE SILENCE I ANSWERED MY HEART SOFTENING TOWARDS HER BUT I CANNOT PROMISE THAT I WILL NEVER TELL HIM
7078-271888-0051 WHAT CHARACTER DO YOU THINK WOULD BEST SUIT ME WELL
7078-271888-0052 THE WOMAN WHO BROKE MEN'S HEARTS I REPLIED MISCHIEVOUSLY EXCELLENT I SHALL BE ABLE TO ASSUME THAT CHARACTER WELL SHE SAID WITH A GRIM SMILE I WILL TELL HIM SPRING CAME AND WENT
7078-271888-0053 BUT I SAW VERY LITTLE OF DICK HE HAD RECEIVED A COMMISSION FROM ONE OF THE ILLUSTRATED PAPERS TO MAKE A SERIES OF SKETCHES OF SCENERY IN SCOTLAND
7078-271888-0054 WHENEVER HE PAID FLYING VISITS TO LONDON HOWEVER HE ALWAYS LOOKED ME UP BUT STRANGELY ENOUGH NEVER MENTIONED ETHEL NEVERTHELESS I ASCERTAINED THAT THEY FREQUENTLY MET
7078-271888-0055 AT THE CLOSE OF A BLUE SUMMER'S DAY WHEN THE DREAMY GOLDEN HAZE WRAPPED THE CITY IN A MYSTIC CHARM I CALLED AT THE STUDIO HAVING HEARD THAT HE HAD RETURNED AND WAS SETTLING DOWN TO WORK WHEN I ENTERED DICK WAS STANDING BEFORE HIS EASEL

7078-271888-0060 PRESENTLY SHE REAPPEARED AND WE WENT TO DINE TOGETHER AT A RESTAURANT IN PICCADILLY AFTERWARDS VISITING A THEATRE AND SPENDING A VERY PLEASANT EVENING POOR DICK I WAS SORRY THAT HE WAS SO INFATUATED
7078-271888-0061 HE WAS SUCH A LARGE HEARTED HONEST FELLOW THAT I FELT QUITE PAINED WHEN I ANTICIPATED THE AWAKENING THAT MUST INEVITABLY COME SOONER OR LATER HE KNEW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF HER PAST AND WAS QUITE IGNORANT THAT SHE HAD BEEN A POPULAR ACTRESS
7078-271888-0062 IN THE MONTHS THAT FOLLOWED I VISITED THE STUDIO ALMOST DAILY AND WATCHED THE GROWTH OF THE PICTURE
7078-271888-0063 THE DELICATE TINTS OF THE NECK AND ARMS WERE REPRODUCED WITH A SKILL THAT BETRAYED THE MASTER HAND
7078-271888-0064 I RETURNED HOME FROM A STROLL ACROSS KENSINGTON GARDENS
7078-271888-0065 HEARD SOME ONE PLAYING UPON MY PIANO AND A SWEET SOPRANO VOICE SINGING TROTERE'S IN OLD MADRID I RECOGNISED THE CLEAR TONES AS THOSE OF ETHEL AH HAROLD SHE CRIED JUMPING UP AS I ENTERED THE ROOM

7078-271888-0070 TEARS WELLED IN HER EYES SHE NODDED BUT DID NOT REPLY A DRY GREY DAY IN MARCH IT WAS SHOW SUNDAY THAT INSTITUTION IN THE ART WORLD WHEN THE PAINTER OPENS HIS STUDIO TO HIS FRIENDS AND THE PUBLIC
7078-271888-0071 TO SHOW THEM THE PICTURE HE IS ABOUT TO SEND TO THE ACADEMY THE EXHIBITION IS IN MANY INSTANCES BUT THE SHOWING BEFOREHAND OF THE GARLANDS OF VICTORY IN A BATTLE WHICH IS DOOMED TO BE LOST FOR WHEN THE OPENING DAY COMES
7078-271888-0072 HAS NO SUCH ORDEAL TO FACE HE NEVER READS HIS NEW ROMANCE TO HIS FRIENDS NOR DO HIS WELL WISHERS APPLAUD IN ADVANCE REVIEWERS HAVE FIRST TILT AT ADVANCE COPIES AND VERY PROPERLY
7078-271888-0073 FROM MORN TILL EVE ON SHOW SUNDAY CAMPDEN HILL IS ALWAYS BLOCKED BY THE CARRIAGES OF THE CURIOUS AND STUDIOS ARE BESIEGED BY FASHIONABLE CROWDS WHOSE CHATTER AND LAUGHTER MINGLES PLEASANTLY WITH THE CLINKING OF TEA CUPS
7078-271888-0074 ON THIS OCCASION AS ON PREVIOUS ONES I ASSISTED DICK TO RECEIVE HIS VISITORS BUT UNFORTUNATELY ETHEL HAD BEEN TAKEN SUDDENLY UNWELL AND COULD NOT ATTEND MY ANTICIPATIONS PROVED CORRECT
7078-271888-0075 THE OPINIONS OF CRITICS WHO DROPPED IN WERE UNANIMOUS THAT IT WAS THE ARTIST'S MASTERPIECE AND THAT THE EXPRESSION AND GENERAL CONCEPTION WERE MARVELLOUS A VERDICT ENDORSED BY GUSHING SOCIETY WOMEN BORED CLUB MEN AND THE INANE JEUNESSE DOREE
7078-271888-0076 A SCRAP OF CONVERSATION I OVERHEARD IN THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON HOWEVER CAUSED ME TO PONDER AN ELDERLY MAN EVIDENTLY A FOREIGNER WEARING THE VIOLET RIBBON OF THE FRENCH ACADEMY IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
7078-271888-0077 WAS STANDING WITH A YOUNG GIRL IN THE CROWD AROUND THE EASEL WHY LOOK PAPA THAT FACE THE GIRL CRIED WHEN HER EYES FELL UPON THE CANVAS IT IS HER PORTRAIT SURELY THE SIGNORE CANNOT KNOW DIO
7078-271888-0078 EXCLAIMED THE OLD MAN EVIDENTLY RECOGNISING THE FEATURES THE PICTURE IS INDEED MAGNIFICENT

7078-271888-0080 IN SURPRISE I GLANCED UP FROM MY WORK OF ROMANCE WEAVING ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING AND SAW DICK PALE AND AGITATED STANDING AT MY ELBOW THE LETTER HE PLACED BEFORE ME WAS IN A WOMAN'S HAND AND EMITTED THE FAINTEST BREATH OF VIOLETS
7078-271888-0081 A GLANCE WAS SUFFICIENT TO RECOGNISE THAT THE SPRAWLY WRITING WAS ETHEL'S TAKING IT UP I EAGERLY READ THE FOLLOWING LINES IT CONTAINED DEAR DICK I REGRET TO TELL YOU THAT CIRCUMSTANCES PRECLUDE ME FROM EVER MEETING YOU AGAIN
7078-271888-0082 I AM GOING FAR AWAY WHERE YOU CANNOT FIND ME IT WAS FOOLISH FOR US TO HAVE LOVED THEREFORE FORGET ME THAT YOU MAY MEET SOME ONE FAR WORTHIER THAN MYSELF
7078-271888-0083 MAY BRING YOU FAME AND FORTUNE IS THE MOST SINCERE HOPE OF YOUR MODELS ETHEL I WARNED YOU AGAINST YOUR INFATUATION OLD FELLOW I SAID SERIOUSLY BUT I COULDN'T HELP IT I I LOVED HER
7078-271888-0084 WHILE HIS FACE ASSUMED A HARD DETERMINED EXPRESSION
7078-271888-0085 AND SHE HAD HER FOOT UPON MY NECK BUT IT IS ALL OVER HE ADDED BITTERLY I SHALL THINK NO MORE OF HER THEN HE WISHED ME AN ABRUPT FAREWELL AND LEFT
7078-271888-0086 THAT EVENING I CALLED AT DICK'S HOUSE BUT WAS INFORMED BY HIS HOUSEKEEPER THAT HE HAD PACKED HIS BAG AND DEPARTED STATING THAT HE WOULD NOT RETURN FOR AT LEAST A MONTH PERHAPS LONGER WHEN I ENTERED THE STUDIO GLOOMY IN THE TWILIGHT
7078-271888-0087 AND THAT IT WAS STANDING IN A CORNER WITH ITS FACE TO THE WALL
7078-271888-0088 AND WHEN I DID SO I DISCOVERED TO MY DISMAY THAT IN HIS FRENZY OF MAD DESPAIR
7078-271888-0089 AND DRAWN IT ACROSS THE FACE MAKING A GREAT UGLY DISFIGURING DAUB OVER THE FOREHEAD AND EYEBROWS UTTERLY RUINING THE FEATURES AND PRODUCING A CURIOUSLY FORBIDDING EFFECT THE COLOUR WAS NOT DRY
7078-271888-0090 THEREFORE I WAS ENABLED TO REMOVE THE GREATER PORTION OF IT WITH A SILK HANDKERCHIEF BUT I SAW WITH REGRET THAT THE TINTS OF THE FOREHEAD HAD BEEN IRRETRIEVABLY RUINED RENDERING THE PICTURE VALUELESS THE DAYS WENT BY
7078-271888-0091 THE LIMIT FOR SENDING IN TO THE ACADEMY WAS APPROACHING BUT DICK DID NOT WRITE AND I COULD ONLY WONDER VAGUELY WHERE HE WAS WANDERING IT WAS A GREAT PITY I THOUGHT THAT SUCH A FINE WORK SHOULD NOT BE EXHIBITED
7078-271888-0092 YET THE WILFUL OBLITERATION HAD UTTERLY SPOILED IT WHILE SITTING IN HIS STUDIO MUSING ONE DAY IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THE FLAW UPON THE FOREHEAD COULD BE HIDDEN IT MIGHT AFTER ALL BE SENT FOR THE INSPECTION OF THE HANGING COMMITTEE
7078-271888-0093 TAKING IT UP I EXAMINED IT MINUTELY IN THE LIGHT THE IDEA OF PLACING A HALF MASK UPON THE FACE SUGGESTED ITSELF AND WITHOUT DELAY I PROCEEDED TO CARRY IT INTO EFFECT
7078-271888-0094 ENABLED ME TO PAINT IN THE HALF LIGHTS UPON THE BLACK SILK AND THE LAUGHING EYES BEING FORTUNATELY INTACT I ALLOWED THEM TO PEER THROUGH THE APERTURES THE EFFECT PRODUCED WAS STARTLING
7078-271888-0095 THE MASK SEEMED TO INCREASE THE RECKLESS DIABLERIE OF ITS WEARER AND ENHANCE THE FAIRNESS OF THE COMPLEXION WHILE IT ADDED AN AIR OF MYSTERY NOT AT ALL UNPLEASING TO THE EYE A FEW DAYS LATER I DISPATCHED IT TO THE ACADEMY
7078-271888-0096 AND WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE OPENING DAY WHEN I EXPERIENCED THE MINGLED SURPRISE AND SATISFACTION OF SEEING IT HUNG UPON THE LINE
7078-271888-0097 WAS PRONOUNCED ONE OF THE PICTURES OF THE YEAR THOUSANDS ADMIRED IT THE PAPERS WERE FULL OF LAUDATORY NOTICES BUT THE MAN WHO PAINTED IT UNAWARE OF THE FAME HE HAD SUDDENLY ACHIEVED WAS HIDING HIS SORROW SOMEWHERE IN THE VOSGES
7078-271888-0098 A STRAY COPY OF AN ENGLISH NEWSPAPER CONTAINING A NOTICE OF HIS WORK WHICH DICK PICKED UP IN A HOTEL HOWEVER CAUSED HIM TO RETURN HE BURST INTO MY ROOM UNCEREMONIOUSLY ONE MORNING STILL ATTIRED IN HIS TRAVELLING ULSTER
7078-271888-0099 I SAW THAT HE WAS HAGGARD EYED AND WILD LOOKING FROM HIS CONVERSATION I KNEW THAT TIME HAD NOT HEALED THE WOUND IN HIS HEART I SHALL NEVER BE ABLE TO THANK YOU SUFFICIENTLY OLD CHAP FOR TOUCHING UP MY DAUB
7078-271888-0100 IT SEEMS THAT THE PUBLIC ADMIRE HER AS MUCH AS I HAVE DONE I I SHALL FIND HER SOME DAY THEN SHE WILL RETURN TO ME STILL THINKING OF HER I OBSERVED REPROACHFULLY YES ALWAYS
7078-271888-0101 ALWAYS HE REPLIED SHAKING HIS HEAD SORROWFULLY I I CANNOT FORGET DICK'S POPULARITY STEADILY INCREASED LUCRATIVE COMMISSIONS POURED IN UPON HIM AND HE SETTLED DOWN TO SUCH HARD
7078-271888-0102 METHODICAL WORK THAT I BEGAN TO THINK HE HAD FORGOTTEN THE WOMAN WHO HAD ENMESHED HIM WITH BEAMING FACE HE CAME TO ME ONE SUMMER'S MORNING AND ANNOUNCED THAT ALTHOUGH THE COMMITTEE OF THE CHANTREY BEQUEST HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE THE MASKED CIRCE HE
7078-271888-0103 THE WELL KNOWN ANGLO ITALIAN MILLIONAIRE AND ART PATRON SAYING THAT HE DESIRED TO BUY IT AND ASKING HIM TO GO DOWN TO OXTED PARK HIS SEAT IN SURREY TO ARRANGE THE PRICE I AM GOING TO DAY HE SAID YOU MASKED HER
7078-271888-0104 AND CONGRATULATED DICK WARMLY UPON HIS MASTERPIECE IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE MEANT TO SECURE IT AT ANY COST
7078-271888-0105 MY COMPANION HAD A CHEQUE FOR FOUR FIGURES IN HIS POCKET WE WERE ABOUT TO MAKE OUR ADIEUX BUT THE COUNT WOULD NOT HEAR OF IT DINNER WILL BE READY ALMOST IMMEDIATELY HE SAID YOU MUST STAY
7078-271888-0106 AH HERE'S THE COUNTESS EXCLAIMED THE MILLIONAIRE STEPPING FORWARD TO INTRODUCE US WE TURNED AND SAW A PALE BEAUTIFUL WOMAN ATTIRED IN A HANDSOME DINNER GOWN ETHEL YOU

7078-271888-0108 AND EXPLANATION AND WE LEFT THE COUNT WHO KNEELING BESIDE HIS WIFE AND ENDEAVOURING TO RESUSCITATE HER WAS COMPLETELY MYSTIFIED AT THE STRANGE RECOGNITION DICK ALMOST BESIDE HIMSELF WITH GRIEF

7078-271888-0110 TO INQUIRE AFTER THE COUNTESS'S HEALTH THE FOOTMAN LOOKED PALE AND GRAVE WHEN I ASKED AFTER HER LADYSHIP I MUCH REGRET TO INFORM YOU SIR THAT MY MISTRESS IS DEAD HE SAID

7078-271888-0112 BUT BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL LIFE WAS EXTINCT THE COUNT IS INSANE WITH GRIEF MORE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THE MAID DISCOVERED THAT HER LADYSHIP HAD LEFT A LETTER TO SOME MAN SHE CALLS DICK TELLING HIM THAT SHE LOVED HIM
7078-271888-0113 AND COULD LIVE NO LONGER DICK RARELY SMILES AND IS INVARIABLY GLOOMY AND SAD POOR FELLOW THE COUNT IGNORANT OF THE TRUTH HAS HUNG HIS LATEST PURCHASE
7078-271888-0114 IN THE PRIVATE GALLERY OF HIS GREAT PALACE IN ROME LITTLE DREAMING THAT
7113-86041-0000 RUBEZAHL OVER ALL THE VAST UNDER WORLD THE MOUNTAIN GNOME RUBEZAHL WAS LORD AND BUSY ENOUGH THE CARE OF HIS DOMINIONS KEPT HIM THERE WERE THE ENDLESS TREASURE CHAMBERS TO BE GONE THROUGH
7113-86041-0001 AND THE HOSTS OF GNOMES TO BE KEPT TO THEIR TASKS SOME BUILT STRONG BARRIERS TO HOLD BACK THE FIERY VAPOURS TO CHANGE DULL STONES TO PRECIOUS METAL OR WERE HARD AT WORK FILLING EVERY CRANNY OF THE ROCKS WITH DIAMONDS AND RUBIES
7113-86041-0002 FOR RUBEZAHL LOVED ALL PRETTY THINGS SOMETIMES THE FANCY WOULD TAKE HIM TO LEAVE THOSE GLOOMY REGIONS AND COME OUT UPON THE GREEN EARTH FOR A WHILE AND BASK IN THE SUNSHINE AND HEAR THE BIRDS SING
7113-86041-0003 AND AS GNOMES LIVE MANY HUNDREDS OF YEARS HE SAW STRANGE THINGS FOR THE FIRST TIME HE CAME UP THE GREAT HILLS WERE COVERED WITH THICK FORESTS
7113-86041-0004 TO HEAR THE THUNDER OF THEIR FALL ECHOING AMONG THE HILLS BUT THE NEXT TIME HE VENTURED ABOVE GROUND WHAT WAS HIS SURPRISE TO FIND EVERYTHING CHANGED THE DARK WOODS WERE HEWN DOWN
7113-86041-0005 AND IN THEIR PLACE APPEARED BLOSSOMING ORCHARDS SURROUNDING COSY LOOKING THATCHED COTTAGES FOR EVERY CHIMNEY THE BLUE SMOKE CURLED PEACEFULLY INTO THE AIR SHEEP AND OXEN FED IN THE FLOWERY MEADOWS
7113-86041-0006 CAME THE MUSIC OF THE SHEPHERD'S PIPE THE STRANGENESS AND PLEASANTNESS OF THE SIGHT SO DELIGHTED THE GNOME THAT HE NEVER THOUGHT OF RESENTING THE INTRUSION OF THESE UNEXPECTED GUESTS WHO WITHOUT SAYING BY YOUR LEAVE OR WITH YOUR LEAVE
7113-86041-0007 NOR DID HE WISH TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR DOINGS BUT LEFT THEM IN QUIET POSSESSION OF THEIR HOMES AS A GOOD HOUSEHOLDER LEAVES IN PEACE THE SWALLOWS WHO HAVE BUILT THEIR NESTS UNDER HIS EAVES
7113-86041-0008 HE WAS INDEED GREATLY MINDED TO MAKE FRIENDS WITH THIS BEING CALLED MAN SO TAKING THE FORM OF AN OLD FIELD LABOURER HE ENTERED THE SERVICE OF A FARMER UNDER HIS CARE ALL THE CROPS FLOURISHED EXCEEDINGLY
7113-86041-0009 BUT THE MASTER PROVED TO BE WASTEFUL AND UNGRATEFUL AND RUBEZAHL SOON LEFT HIM AND WENT TO BE SHEPHERD TO HIS NEXT NEIGHBOUR
7113-86041-0010 AND WHERE AMONG THE HILLS TO LOOK FOR ANY WHO STRAYED AWAY THAT THEY TOO PROSPERED UNDER HIS CARE AND NOT ONE WAS LOST OR TORN BY WOLVES BUT THIS NEW MASTER WAS A HARD MAN AND BEGRUDGED HIM HIS WELL EARNED WAGES
7113-86041-0011 SO HE RAN AWAY AND WENT TO SERVE THE JUDGE HERE HE UPHELD THE LAW WITH MIGHT AND MAIN AND WAS A TERROR TO THIEVES AND EVILDOERS BUT THE JUDGE WAS A BAD MAN WHO TOOK BRIBES AND DESPISED THE LAW
7113-86041-0012 DOWN TO HIS UNDERGROUND PALACE VERY MUCH DISAPPOINTED BY HIS FIRST EXPERIENCE OF MANKIND BUT AS TIME WENT ON HE FORGOT THE DISAGREEABLE THINGS THAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM AND THOUGHT HE WOULD TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE UPPER WORLD
7113-86041-0013 WHERE STOOD A CHARMING MAIDEN FRESH AS THE SPRING AND BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK UPON AROUND HER UPON THE GRASS LAY HER YOUNG COMPANIONS AS IF THEY HAD THROWN THEMSELVES DOWN TO REST AFTER SOME MERRY GAME
7113-86041-0014 BEYOND THEM FLOWED A LITTLE BROOK INTO WHICH A WATERFALL LEAPT FROM A HIGH ROCK FILLING THE AIR WITH ITS PLEASANT SOUND AND MAKING A COOLNESS EVEN IN THE SULTRY NOONTIDE
7113-86041-0015 THE SIGHT OF THE MAIDEN SO PLEASED THE GNOME THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME HE WISHED HIMSELF A MORTAL AND LONGING FOR A BETTER VIEW OF THE GAY COMPANY HE CHANGED HIMSELF INTO A RAVEN
7113-86041-0016 HE COULD ONLY SEE WITH A RAVEN'S EYES AND FEEL AS A RAVEN FEELS AND A NEST OF FIELD MICE AT THE FOOT OF THE TREE INTERESTED HIM FAR MORE THAN THE SPORT OF THE MAIDENS
7113-86041-0017 WHEN HE UNDERSTOOD THIS HE FLEW DOWN AGAIN IN A GREAT HURRY INTO THE THICKET AND TOOK THE FORM OF A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN THAT WAS THE BEST WAY AND HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE GIRL THEN AND THERE
7113-86041-0018 THE FAIR MAIDEN WAS THE DAUGHTER OF THE KING OF THE COUNTRY AND SHE OFTEN WANDERED IN THE FOREST WITH HER PLAY FELLOWS GATHERING THE WILD FLOWERS AND FRUITS TILL THE MIDDAY HEAT DROVE THE MERRY BAND TO THE SHADY LAWN
7113-86041-0019 BY THE BROOK TO REST OR TO BATHE IN THE COOL WATERS ON THIS PARTICULAR MORNING THE FANCY TOOK THEM TO WANDER OFF AGAIN INTO THE WOOD THIS
7113-86041-0020 STEPPING OUT OF HIS HIDING PLACE
7113-86041-0021 WEAVING HIS MAGIC SPELLS TILL SLOWLY ALL ABOUT HIM CHANGED AND WHEN THE MAIDENS RETURNED AT NOON TO THEIR FAVOURITE RESTING PLACE THEY STOOD LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND ALMOST FANCIED THAT THEY MUST BE DREAMING
7113-86041-0022 THE RED ROCKS HAD BECOME WHITE MARBLE AND ALABASTER THE STREAM THAT MURMURED AND STRUGGLED BEFORE IN ITS ROCKY BED FLOWED IN SILENCE NOW IN ITS SMOOTH CHANNEL FROM WHICH A CLEAR FOUNTAIN LEAPT
7113-86041-0023 AS THE WANDERING BREEZE SCATTERED IT DAISIES AND FORGET ME NOTS FRINGED ITS BRINK WHILE TALL HEDGES OF ROSES AND JASMINE RINGED IT ROUND MAKING THE SWEETEST AND DAINTIEST BOWER IMAGINABLE
7113-86041-0024 WERE SPREAD OUT STRANGE FRUITS AND SWEETMEATS THE VERY SIGHT OF WHICH MADE THE PRINCESS LONG TO TASTE THEM SHE HESITATED A WHILE HOWEVER SCARCELY ABLE TO BELIEVE HER EYES
7113-86041-0025 BUT AT LENGTH CURIOSITY PREVAILED AND SHE AND HER COMPANIONS EXPLORED TO THEIR HEART'S CONTENT
7113-86041-0026 RUNNING HITHER AND THITHER IN HIGH GLEE AND CALLING MERRILY TO EACH OTHER AT LAST WHEN THEY WERE QUITE WEARY THE PRINCESS CRIED OUT SUDDENLY THAT NOTHING WOULD CONTENT HER BUT TO BATHE IN THE MARBLE POOL
7113-86041-0027 WHICH CERTAINLY DID LOOK VERY INVITING AND THEY ALL WENT GAILY TO THIS NEW AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS WAS READY FIRST BUT SCARCELY HAD SHE SLIPPED OVER THE RIM OF THE POOL WHEN DOWN DOWN DOWN SHE SANK
7113-86041-0028 AND VANISHED IN ITS DEPTHS BEFORE HER FRIGHTENED PLAYMATES COULD SEIZE HER BY SO MUCH AS A LOCK OF HER FLOATING GOLDEN HAIR LOUDLY DID THEY WEEP AND WAIL RUNNING ABOUT THE BRINK OF THE POOL WHICH LOOKED SO SHALLOW AND SO CLEAR
7113-86041-0029 BUT WHICH HAD SWALLOWED UP THEIR PRINCESS BEFORE THEIR EYES THEY EVEN SPRANG INTO THE WATER AND TRIED TO DIVE AFTER HER BUT IN VAIN THEY ONLY FLOATED LIKE CORKS IN THE ENCHANTED POOL AND COULD NOT KEEP UNDER WATER FOR A SECOND
7113-86041-0030 THEY SAW AT LAST THAT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO CARRY TO THE KING THE SAD TIDINGS OF HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER'S DISAPPEARANCE AND WHAT GREAT WEEPING AND LAMENTATION THERE WAS IN THE PALACE WHEN THE DREADFUL NEWS WAS TOLD
7113-86041-0031 THE SCENE OF THIS STRANGE ADVENTURE THINKING AS PEOPLE WILL IN SORROW THAT THERE MIGHT BE SOME MISTAKE AFTER ALL BUT WHEN HE REACHED THE SPOT BEHOLD ALL WAS CHANGED AGAIN
7113-86041-0032 THE GLITTERING GROTTO DESCRIBED TO HIM BY THE MAIDENS HAD COMPLETELY VANISHED AND SO HAD THE MARBLE BATH THE BOWER OF JASMINE INSTEAD ALL WAS A TANGLE OF FLOWERS AS IT HAD BEEN OF OLD
7113-86041-0033 THE KING WAS SO MUCH PERPLEXED THAT HE THREATENED THE PRINCESS'S PLAYFELLOWS WITH ALL SORTS OF PUNISHMENTS IF THEY WOULD NOT CONFESS SOMETHING ABOUT HER DISAPPEARANCE BUT AS THEY ONLY REPEATED THE SAME STORY HE PRESENTLY PUT DOWN THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE WORK OF SOME
7113-86041-0034 SPRITE OR GOBLIN AND TRIED TO CONSOLE HIMSELF FOR HIS LOSS BY ORDERING A GRAND HUNT FOR KINGS CANNOT BEAR TO BE TROUBLED ABOUT ANYTHING LONG MEANWHILE THE PRINCESS WAS NOT AT ALL UNHAPPY
7113-86041-0035 THEY SWAM WITH HER QUICKLY BY STRANGE UNDERGROUND WAYS TO A PALACE SO SPLENDID THAT HER FATHER'S SEEMED BUT A POOR COTTAGE IN COMPARISON WITH IT AND WHEN SHE RECOVERED FROM HER ASTONISHMENT SHE FOUND HERSELF SEATED UPON A COUCH
7113-86041-0036 WRAPPED IN A WONDERFUL ROBE OF SATIN FASTENED WITH A SILKEN GIRDLE WHILE BESIDE HER KNELT A YOUNG MAN WHO WHISPERED THE SWEETEST SPEECHES IMAGINABLE IN HER EAR THE GNOME FOR HE IT WAS TOLD HER ALL ABOUT HIMSELF
7113-86041-0037 AND HIS GREAT UNDERGROUND KINGDOM AND PRESENTLY LED HER THROUGH THE MANY ROOMS AND HALLS OF THE PALACE AND SHOWED HER THE RARE AND WONDERFUL THINGS DISPLAYED IN THEM TILL SHE WAS FAIRLY DAZZLED AT THE SIGHT OF SO MUCH SPLENDOUR
7113-86041-0038 ON THREE SIDES OF THE CASTLE LAY A LOVELY GARDEN WITH MASSES OF GAY SWEET FLOWERS AND VELVET LAWNS ALL COOL AND SHADY WHICH PLEASED THE EYE OF THE PRINCESS THE FRUIT TREES WERE HUNG WITH GOLDEN AND ROSY APPLES
7113-86041-0039 AND NIGHTINGALES SANG IN EVERY BUSH AS THE GNOME AND THE PRINCESS WANDERED IN THE LEAFY ALLEYS SOMETIMES GAZING AT THE MOON SOMETIMES PAUSING TO GATHER THE RAREST FLOWERS FOR HER ADORNMENT
7113-86041-0040 BUT THE PRINCESS FELT NO SUCH HAPPINESS IN SPITE OF ALL THE MAGIC DELIGHTS AROUND HER SHE WAS SAD THOUGH SHE TRIED TO SEEM CONTENT FOR FEAR OF DISPLEASING THE GNOME HOWEVER HE SOON PERCEIVED HER MELANCHOLY
7113-86041-0041 AND IN A THOUSAND WAYS STROVE TO DISPEL THE CLOUD BUT IN VAIN AT LAST HE SAID TO HIMSELF MEN ARE SOCIABLE CREATURES LIKE BEES OR ANTS
7113-86041-0042 WHO IS THERE I CAN FIND FOR HER TO TALK TO
7113-86041-0043 CARROTS TURNIPS AND RADISHES AND LAYING THEM CAREFULLY IN AN ELEGANT BASKET BROUGHT THEM TO THE PRINCESS WHO SAT PENSIVE IN THE SHADE OF THE ROSE BOWER LOVELIEST DAUGHTER OF EARTH SAID THE GNOME BANISH ALL SORROW
7113-86041-0044 NO MORE SHALL YOU BE LONELY IN MY DWELLING
7113-86041-0045 TAKE THIS LITTLE MANY COLOURED WAND AND WITH A TOUCH GIVE TO EACH ROOT THE FORM YOU DESIRE TO SEE WITH THIS HE LEFT HER AND THE PRINCESS WITHOUT AN INSTANT'S DELAY OPENED THE BASKET
7113-86041-0046 THIS SUDDEN APPEARANCE WAS SO DELIGHTFUL THAT THE PRINCESS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE HER OWN EYES AND WAS QUITE BESIDE HERSELF WITH THE JOY OF HAVING HER DEAR PLAYFELLOW WITH HER ONCE MORE HAND IN HAND THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE ENCHANTED GARDEN
7113-86041-0047 AND GATHERED THE GOLDEN APPLES FROM THE TREES AND WHEN THEY WERE TIRED OF THIS AMUSEMENT THE PRINCESS LED HER FRIEND THROUGH ALL THE WONDERFUL ROOMS OF THE PALACE UNTIL AT LAST THEY CAME TO THE ONE IN WHICH WERE KEPT ALL THE MARVELLOUS DRESSES AND ORNAMENTS
7113-86041-0048 THE GNOME HAD GIVEN TO HIS HOPED FOR BRIDE THERE THEY FOUND SO MUCH TO AMUSE THEM THAT THE HOURS PASSED LIKE MINUTES VEILS GIRDLES AND NECKLACES WERE TRIED ON AND ADMIRED
7113-86041-0049 AND SHOWED SO MUCH TASTE THAT NOBODY
7113-86041-0050 THE GNOME WHO HAD SECRETLY BEEN KEEPING AN EYE UPON THEM WAS VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR HAVING SO WELL UNDERSTOOD THE HEART OF A WOMAN AND THE PRINCESS SEEMED TO HIM EVEN MORE CHARMING THAN BEFORE
7113-86041-0051 SHE DID NOT FORGET TO TOUCH THE REST OF THE ROOTS WITH HER MAGIC WAND AND SOON HAD ALL HER MAIDENS ABOUT HER AND EVEN AS SHE HAD TWO TINY RADISHES TO SPARE
7113-86041-0052 WHOSE NAME WAS BENI AND NOW ALL WENT CHEERFULLY IN THE CASTLE THE PRINCESS GAVE TO EACH OF THE MAIDENS HER TASK AND NEVER WAS MISTRESS BETTER SERVED FOR A WHOLE WEEK SHE ENJOYED THE DELIGHT OF HER PLEASANT COMPANY UNDISTURBED
7113-86041-0053 THEY PLAYED FROM MORNING TO NIGHT ONLY THE PRINCESS NOTICED THAT DAY BY DAY THE FRESH YOUNG FACES OF HER MAIDENS GREW PALE AND WAN AND THE MIRROR IN THE GREAT MARBLE HALL SHOWED HER THAT SHE ALONE STILL KEPT HER ROSY BLOOM
7113-86041-0054 WHILE BRUNHILDA AND THE REST FADED VISIBLY THEY ASSURED HER THAT ALL WAS WELL WITH THEM BUT NEVERTHELESS THEY CONTINUED TO WASTE AWAY
7113-86041-0055 TAKE PART IN THE GAMES OF THE PRINCESS TILL AT LAST ONE FINE MORNING WHEN THE PRINCESS STARTED FROM BED AND HASTENED OUT TO JOIN HER GAY PLAYFELLOWS SHE SHUDDERED
7113-86041-0056 AND STARTED BACK AT THE SIGHT OF A GROUP OF SHRIVELLED CRONES WITH BENT BACKS AND TREMBLING LIMBS WHO SUPPORTED THEIR TOTTERING STEPS WITH STAVES AND CRUTCHES AND COUGHED DISMALLY A LITTLE NEARER TO THE HEARTH
7113-86041-0057 LAY THE ONCE FROLICSOME BENI WITH ALL FOUR FEET STRETCHED STIFFLY OUT WHILE THE SLEEK CAT SEEMED TOO WEAK TO RAISE HIS HEAD FROM HIS VELVET CUSHION THE HORRIFIED PRINCESS FLED TO THE DOOR
7113-86041-0058 THE GREATEST DELIGHT OF MY LONELY HOURS ISN'T THIS SOLITARY LIFE IN SUCH A DESERT BAD ENOUGH WITHOUT YOUR TURNING THE CASTLE INTO A HOSPITAL FOR THE AGED GIVE MY MAIDENS BACK THEIR YOUTH AND HEALTH THIS VERY MINUTE OR I WILL NEVER LOVE YOU
7113-86041-0059 SWEETEST AND FAIREST OF DAMSELS CRIED THE GNOME DO NOT BE ANGRY EVERYTHING THAT IS IN MY POWER I WILL DO BUT DO NOT ASK THE IMPOSSIBLE SO LONG AS THE SAP WAS FRESH IN THE ROOTS
7113-86041-0060 THE MAGIC STAFF COULD KEEP THEM IN THE FORMS YOU DESIRED BUT AS THE SAP DRIED UP THEY WITHERED AWAY BUT NEVER TROUBLE YOURSELF ABOUT THAT DEAREST ONE A BASKET OF FRESH TURNIPS WILL SOON SET MATTERS RIGHT
7113-86041-0061 AND YOU CAN SPEEDILY CALL UP AGAIN EVERY FORM YOU WISH TO SEE THE GREAT GREEN PATCH IN THE GARDEN WILL PROVE YOU WITH A MORE LIVELY COMPANY SO SAYING THE GNOME TOOK HIMSELF OFF
7113-86041-0062 AND THE PRINCESS WITH HER MAGIC WAND TOUCHED THE WRINKLED OLD WOMEN AND LEFT THEM THE WITHERED ROOTS THEY REALLY WERE TO BE THROWN UPON THE RUBBISH HEAP AND WITH LIGHT FEET SKIPPED OFF ACROSS TO THE MEADOW
7113-86041-0063 TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE FRESHLY FILLED BASKET BUT TO HER SURPRISE SHE COULD NOT FIND IT ANYWHERE UP AND DOWN THE GARDEN SHE SEARCHED SPYING INTO EVERY CORNER BUT NOT A SIGN OF IT WAS TO BE FOUND
7113-86041-0064 BY THE TRELLIS OF GRAPE VINES SHE MET THE GNOME WHO WAS SO MUCH EMBARRASSED AT THE SIGHT OF HER THAT SHE BECAME AWARE OF HIS CONFUSION WHILE HE WAS STILL QUITE A LONG WAY OFF
7113-86041-0065 DEAR QUEEN OF MY HEART ANSWERED HE I PRAY YOU TO FORGIVE MY CARELESSNESS I PROMISED MORE THAN I COULD PERFORM I HAVE SOUGHT ALL OVER THE LAND FOR THE ROOTS YOU DESIRE BUT THEY ARE GATHERED IN AND LIE DRYING IN MUSTY CELLARS
7113-86041-0066 AND THE FIELDS ARE BARE AND DESOLATE FOR BELOW IN THE VALLEY WINTER REIGNS ONLY HERE IN YOUR PRESENCE SPRING IS HELD FAST AND WHEREVER YOUR FOOT IS SET THE GAY FLOWERS BLOOM HAVE PATIENCE FOR A LITTLE
7113-86041-0067 AND THEN WITHOUT FAIL YOU SHALL HAVE YOUR PUPPETS TO PLAY WITH ALMOST BEFORE THE GNOME HAD FINISHED THE DISAPPOINTED PRINCESS TURNED AWAY AND MARCHED OFF TO HER OWN APARTMENTS WITHOUT DEIGNING TO ANSWER HIM THE GNOME HOWEVER
7113-86041-0068 AND DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A FARMER BOUGHT AN ASS IN THE NEAREST MARKET TOWN AND BROUGHT IT BACK LOADED WITH SACKS OF TURNIP CARROT AND RADISH SEED WITH THIS HE SOWED A GREAT FIELD
7113-86041-0069 AND SENT A VAST ARMY OF HIS GOBLINS TO WATCH AND TEND IT AND TO BRING UP THE FIERY RIVERS FROM THE HEART OF THE EARTH NEAR ENOUGH TO WARM AND ENCOURAGE THE SPROUTING SEEDS THUS FOSTERED THEY GREW AND FLOURISHED MARVELLOUSLY
7113-86041-0070 HE IMAGINED THAT SHE WAS TOO YOUNG AND INEXPERIENCED TO CARE FOR HIM BUT THAT WAS A MISTAKE FOR THE TRUTH WAS THAT ANOTHER IMAGE ALREADY FILLED HER HEART THE YOUNG PRINCE RATIBOR WHOSE LANDS JOINED HER FATHER'S HAD WON THE HEART OF THE PRINCESS
7113-86041-0071 LOOKING FORWARD TO THE COMING OF THEIR WEDDING DAY WHEN THE BRIDE'S MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE TOOK PLACE THE SAD NEWS DROVE RATIBOR DISTRACTED AND AS THE DAYS WENT ON AND NOTHING COULD BE HEARD OF THE PRINCESS HE FORSOOK HIS CASTLE
7113-86041-0072 AND THE SOCIETY OF MEN AND SPENT HIS DAYS IN THE WILD FORESTS ROAMING ABOUT AND CRYING HER NAME ALOUD TO THE TREES AND ROCKS MEANWHILE THE MAIDEN IN HER GORGEOUS PRISON SIGHED IN SECRET OVER HER GRIEF NOT WISHING TO AROUSE THE GNOME'S SUSPICIONS
7113-86041-0073 IN HER OWN MIND SHE WAS WONDERING IF BY ANY MEANS SHE MIGHT ESCAPE FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND AT LAST SHE HIT UPON A PLAN BY THIS TIME SPRING ONCE MORE REIGNED IN THE VALLEY AND THE GNOME SENT THE FIRES BACK TO THEIR PLACES IN THE DEEPS OF THE EARTH
7113-86041-0074 FOR THE ROOTS WHICH THEY HAD KEPT WARM THROUGH ALL THE CRUEL WINTER HAND NOW COME TO THEIR FULL SIZE DAY BY DAY THE PRINCESS PULLED UP SOME OF THEM AND MADE EXPERIMENTS WITH THEM CONJURING UP NOW THIS LONGED FOR PERSON AND NOW THAT
7113-86041-0075 JUST FOR THE PLEASURE OF SEEING THEM AS THEY APPEARED BUT SHE REALLY HAD ANOTHER PURPOSE IN VIEW ONE DAY SHE CHANGED A TINY TURNIP INTO A BEE AND SENT HIM OFF TO BRING HER SOME NEWS OF HER LOVER FLY
7113-86041-0076 SO THE BEE SPREAD HIS SHINING WINGS AND FLEW AWAY TO DO AS HE WAS BIDDEN BUT BEFORE HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT A GREEDY SWALLOW MADE A SNATCH AT HIM AND TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF THE PRINCESS HER MESSENGER WAS EATEN UP
7113-86041-0077 THEN AND THERE AFTER THAT BY THE POWER OF THE WONDERFUL WAND SHE SUMMONED A CRICKET AND TAUGHT HIM THIS GREETING HOP LITTLE CRICKET TO RATIBOR AND CHIRP IN HIS EAR THAT I LOVE HIM ONLY
7113-86041-0078 BUT THAT I AM HELD CAPTIVE BY THE GNOME IN HIS PALACE UNDER THE MOUNTAINS SO THE CRICKET HOPPED OFF GAILY DETERMINED TO DO HIS BEST TO DELIVER HIS MESSAGE BUT ALAS A LONG LEGGED STORK WHO WAS PRANCING ALONG THE SAME ROAD
7113-86041-0079 CAUGHT HIM IN HER CRUEL BEAK AND BEFORE HE COULD SAY A WORD HE HAD DISAPPEARED DOWN HER THROAT THESE TWO UNLUCKY VENTURES DID NOT PREVENT THE PRINCESS FROM TRYING ONCE MORE
7113-86041-0080 THIS TIME SHE CHANGED THE TURNIP INTO A MAGPIE FLUTTER FROM TREE TO TREE CHATTERING BIRD SAID SHE TILL YOU COME TO RATIBOR MY LOVE
7113-86041-0081 AND BID HIM COME WITH HORSES AND MEN THE THIRD DAY FROM THIS TO THE HILL THAT RISES FROM THE THORNY VALLEY THE MAGPIE LISTENED HOPPED AWHILE FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH AND THEN DARTED AWAY
7113-86041-0082 NOW PRINCE RATIBOR WAS STILL SPENDING HIS LIFE IN WANDERING ABOUT THE WOODS AND NOT EVEN THE BEAUTY OF THE SPRING COULD SOOTHE HIS GRIEF ONE DAY AS HE SAT IN THE SHADE OF AN OAK TREE DREAMING OF HIS LOST PRINCESS AND SOMETIMES CRYING HER NAME ALOUD
7113-86041-0083 WHICH BELONGS TO AN UNLUCKY MORTAL WHO WISHES THE EARTH WOULD OPEN AND SWALLOW UP HIM AND HIS MEMORY FOR EVER THEREUPON HE CAUGHT UP A GREAT STONE
7113-86041-0084 BUT THE MAGPIE IN THE TREE WHO LIKE
7113-86041-0085 UNLESS HE COULD BE FOR EVER CHATTERING
7113-86041-0086 ALL HIS GLOOM AND MISERY VANISHED IN A MOMENT AND HE ANXIOUSLY QUESTIONED THE WELCOME MESSENGER AS TO THE FATE OF THE PRINCESS BUT THE MAGPIE KNEW NO MORE THAN THE LESSON HE HAD LEARNT SO HE SOON FLUTTERED AWAY
7113-86041-0087 WHILE THE PRINCE HURRIED BACK TO HIS CASTLE TO GATHER TOGETHER A TROOP OF HORSEMEN FULL OF COURAGE FOR WHATEVER MIGHT BEFALL THE PRINCESS MEANWHILE WAS CRAFTILY PURSUING HER PLAN OF ESCAPE
7113-86041-0088 SHE LEFT OFF TREATING THE GNOME WITH COLDNESS AND INDIFFERENCE INDEED THERE WAS A LOOK IN HER EYES WHICH ENCOURAGED HIM TO HOPE THAT SHE MIGHT SOME DAY RETURN HIS LOVE AND THE IDEA PLEASED HIM MIGHTILY THE NEXT DAY
7113-86041-0089 AS SOON AS THE SUN ROSE SHE MADE HER APPEARANCE DECKED AS A BRIDE IN THE WONDERFUL ROBES AND JEWELS WHICH THE FOND GNOME HAD PREPARED FOR HER HER GOLDEN HAIR WAS BRAIDED AND CROWNED WITH MYRTLE BLOSSOMS
7113-86041-0090 AND HER FLOWING VEIL SPARKLED WITH GEMS IN THESE MAGNIFICENT GARMENTS SHE WENT TO MEET THE GNOME UPON THE GREAT TERRACE LOVELIEST OF MAIDENS HE STAMMERED BOWING LOW BEFORE HER LET ME GAZE INTO YOUR DEAR EYES
7113-86041-0091 YOUR CONSTANCY HAS OVERCOME ME SHE SAID I CAN NO LONGER OPPOSE YOUR WISHES BUT BELIEVE MY WORDS AND SUFFER THIS VEIL STILL TO HIDE MY BLUSHES AND TEARS WHY TEARS BELOVED ONE CRIED THE GNOME ANXIOUSLY
7113-86041-0092 EVERY TEAR OF YOURS FALLS UPON MY HEART LIKE A DROP OF MOLTEN GOLD GREATLY AS I DESIRE YOUR LOVE I DO NOT ASK A SACRIFICE AH CRIED THE FALSE PRINCESS WHY DO YOU MISUNDERSTAND MY TEARS
7113-86041-0093 AND YET I AM FEARFUL A WIFE CANNOT ALWAYS CHARM AND THOUGH YOU WILL NEVER ALTER THE BEAUTY OF MORTALS IS AS A FLOWER THAT FADES HOW CAN I BE SURE THAT YOU WILL ALWAYS BE AS LOVING AND CHARMING AS YOU ARE NOW
7113-86041-0094 ASK SOME PROOF SWEETHEART SAID HE PUT MY OBEDIENCE AND MY PATIENCE TO SOME TEST BY WHICH YOU CAN JUDGE OF MY UNALTERABLE LOVE BE IT SO ANSWERED THE CRAFTY MAIDEN THEN GIVE ME
7113-86041-0095 THAT SHALL BE THE TEST OF YOUR TRUTH TOWARDS ME UNWILLING AS THE GNOME WAS TO LOSE SIGHT OF HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE FOR A MOMENT HE OBEYED HER COMMANDS WITHOUT DELAY AND HURRIED OFF TO BEGIN HIS TASK
7113-86041-0096 HE SKIPPED ALONG AMONG THE TURNIPS AS NIMBLE AS A GRASSHOPPER AND HAD SOON COUNTED THEM ALL BUT TO BE QUITE CERTAIN THAT HE HAD MADE NO MISTAKE HE THOUGHT HE WOULD JUST RUN OVER THEM AGAIN
7113-86041-0097 THIS TIME TO HIS GREAT ANNOYANCE THE NUMBER WAS DIFFERENT SO HE RECKONED THEM FOR THE THIRD TIME BUT NOW THE NUMBER WAS NOT THE SAME AS EITHER OF THE PREVIOUS ONES AND THIS WAS HARDLY TO BE WONDERED AT AS HIS MIND WAS FULL OF THE PRINCESS'S
7113-86041-0098 PRETTY LOOKS AND WORDS AS FOR THE MAIDEN NO SOONER WAS HER DELUDED LOVER FAIRLY OUT OF SIGHT THAN SHE BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR FLIGHT SHE HAD A FINE FRESH TURNIP HIDDEN CLOSE AT HAND
7113-86041-0099 WHICH SHE CHANGED INTO A SPIRITED HORSE ALL SADDLED AND BRIDLED AND SPRINGING UPON ITS BACK SHE GALLOPED AWAY OVER HILL AND DALE TILL SHE REACHED THE THORNY VALLEY AND FLUNG HERSELF
7113-86041-0100 INTO THE ARMS OF HER BELOVED PRINCE RATIBOR MEANWHILE THE TOILING GNOME WENT THROUGH HIS TASK OVER AND OVER AGAIN TILL HIS BACK ACHED AND HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE COULD NO LONGER PUT TWO AND TWO TOGETHER
7113-86041-0101 BUT AS HE FELT TOLERABLY CERTAIN OF THE EXACT NUMBER OF TURNIPS IN THE FIELD BIG AND LITTLE TOGETHER HE HURRIED BACK EAGER TO PROVE TO HIS BELOVED ONE WHAT A DELIGHTFUL AND SUBMISSIVE HUSBAND HE WOULD BE HE FELT VERY WELL SATISFIED WITH HIMSELF
7113-86041-0102 AS HE CROSSED THE MOSSY LAWN TO THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HER BUT ALAS SHE WAS NO LONGER THERE HE SEARCHED EVERY THICKET AND PATH HE LOOKED BEHIND EVERY TREE AND GAZED INTO EVERY POND
7113-86041-0103 BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS THEN HE HASTENED INTO THE PALACE AND RUSHED FROM ROOM TO ROOM PEERING INTO EVERY HOLE AND CORNER AND CALLING HER BY NAME BUT ONLY
7113-86041-0104 ECHO ANSWERED IN THE MARBLE HALLS THERE WAS NEITHER VOICE NOR FOOTSTEP THEN HE BEGAN TO PERCEIVE THAT SOMETHING WAS AMISS AND THROWING OFF THE MORTAL FORM THAT ENCUMBERED HIM HE FLEW OUT OF THE PALACE
7113-86041-0105 AND SOARED HIGH INTO THE AIR AND SAW THE FUGITIVE PRINCESS IN THE FAR DISTANCE JUST AS THE SWIFT HORSE CARRIED HER ACROSS THE BOUNDARY OF HIS DOMINIONS FURIOUSLY
7113-86041-0106 AND HURL A THUNDERBOLT AFTER THE FLYING MAIDEN SPLINTERING THE ROCKY BARRIERS WHICH HAD STOOD A THOUSAND YEARS BUT HIS FURY WAS VAIN THE THUNDERCLOUDS MELTED AWAY INTO A SOFT MIST
7113-86041-0107 AND THE GNOME AFTER FLYING ABOUT FOR A WHILE IN DESPAIR BEWAILING TO THE FOUR WINDS HIS UNHAPPY FATE WENT SORROWFULLY BACK TO THE PALACE AND STOLE ONCE MORE THROUGH EVERY ROOM WITH MANY SIGHS AND LAMENTATIONS
7113-86041-0108 HE PASSED THROUGH THE GARDENS WHICH FOR HIM HAD LOST THEIR CHARM AND THE SIGHT OF THE PRINCESS'S FOOTPRINTS ON THE GOLDEN SAND OF THE PATHWAY RENEWED HIS GRIEF ALL WAS LONELY EMPTY SORROWFUL
7113-86041-0109 AND THE FORSAKEN GNOME RESOLVED THAT HE WOULD HAVE NO MORE DEALINGS WITH SUCH FALSE CREATURES
7113-86041-0110 TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS UNDERGROUND KINGDOM
7148-59157-0000 AND IN THE RESULT WE CAN ACCOMPANY KEATS THROUGH THE GLAD AND SAD AND MAD AND BAD HOURS OF HIS SHORT AND MARVELLOUS LIFE
7148-59157-0001 WE ARE STILL LEFT IN THE DARK IT IS TRUE AS TO KEATS'S RACE AND DESCENT WHETHER KEATS'S FATHER CAME TO LONDON FROM CORNWALL OR NOT SIR SIDNEY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO DECIDE ON
7148-59157-0002 THE RATHER SHAKY EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN PUT FORWARD IF IT SHOULD HEREAFTER TURN OUT THAT KEATS WAS A CORNISHMAN AT ONE REMOVE MATTHEW ARNOLD'S CONJECTURE AS TO THE CELTIC ELEMENT IN HIM
7148-59157-0003 AT THE SIGN OF THE SWAN AND HOOP FINSBURY PAVEMENT AND MARRIED HIS MASTER'S DAUGHTER IT WAS AT THE STABLE AT THE SWAN AND HOOP NOT A PUBLIC HOUSE BY THE WAY BUT A LIVERY STABLE
7148-59157-0004 THAT KEATS WAS PREMATURELY BORN AT THE END OF OCTOBER SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE
7148-59157-0005 HE WAS SCARCELY NINE YEARS OLD WHEN HIS FATHER WAS KILLED BY A FALL FROM A HORSE HE WAS ONLY FOURTEEN WHEN HIS MOTHER WHO HAD RE MARRIED UNHAPPILY AND THEN BEEN SEPARATED FROM HER HUSBAND DIED A VICTIM OF CHRONIC RHEUMATISM AND CONSUMPTION
7148-59157-0006 IT IS FROM HIS MOTHER THAT KEATS SEEMS TO HAVE INHERITED HIS IMPETUOUS AND PASSIONATE NATURE THERE IS THE EVIDENCE OF A CERTAIN WHOLESALE TEA DEALER THE RESPECTABILITY OF WHOSE TRADE MAY HAVE INCLINED HIM TO CENSORIOUSNESS
7148-59157-0007 SHE WAS A PERSON OF UNBRIDLED TEMPERAMENT AND THAT IN HER LATER YEARS SHE FELL INTO LOOSE WAYS AND WAS NO CREDIT TO THE FAMILY THAT SHE HAD OTHER QUALITIES BESIDES THOSE MENTIONED BY THE TEA DEALER IS SHOWN BY THE PASSIONATE AFFECTION
7148-59157-0008 THAT EXISTED BETWEEN HER AND HER SON JOHN ONCE AS A YOUNG CHILD WHEN SHE WAS ORDERED TO BE KEPT QUIET DURING AN ILLNESS HE IS SAID TO HAVE INSISTED ON KEEPING WATCH AT HER DOOR WITH AN OLD SWORD AND ALLOWING NO ONE TO GO IN
7148-59157-0009 AS SHE LAY DYING HE SAT UP WHOLE NIGHTS WITH HER IN A GREAT CHAIR WOULD SUFFER NOBODY TO GIVE HER MEDICINE OR EVEN COOK HER FOOD BUT HIMSELF AND READ NOVELS TO HER IN HER INTERVALS OF EASE
7148-59157-0010 THEIR GRANDFATHER THE PROPRIETOR OF THE LIVERY STABLE
7148-59157-0011 TILL THE AGE OF SIXTEEN AND AFTERWARDS ENABLED HIM TO ATTEND GUY'S HOSPITAL AS A MEDICAL STUDENT IT IS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO CREDIT THE ACCEPTED STORY THAT HE PASSED ALL HIS BOYHOOD WITHOUT MAKING ANY ATTEMPT
7148-59157-0012 AT WRITING POETRY HE DID NOT BEGIN TO WRITE SAYS SIR SIDNEY COLVIN TILL HE WAS NEAR EIGHTEEN
7148-59157-0013 THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON INDEED IN ALL THE KEATS CIRCLE TO WHOM ONE IS MORE PASSIONATELY GRATEFUL THAN TO COWDEN CLARKE THAT IS FANNY BRAWNE
7148-59157-0014 WITH HIS GENIUS BEFORE THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTEEN WHEN HE MET FANNY BRAWNE FOR THE FIRST TIME NONE THE LESS HAD HE DIED BEFORE THAT DATE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN REMEMBERED IN LITERATURE NOT AS A MARVELLOUS ORIGINAL ARTIST
7148-59157-0015 SHE WAS UNQUESTIONABLY HIS GOOD FAIRY AS A POET THIS IS THE ONLY MATTER UPON WHICH ONE IS SERIOUSLY DISPOSED TO QUARREL WITH SIR SIDNEY COLVIN AS A BIOGRAPHER HE DOES NOT EMPHASIZE AS HE OUGHT THE DEBT WE ARE UNDER TO FANNY BRAWNE
7148-59157-0016 AS THE INTENSIFIER OF KEATS'S GENIUS THE MINX AS KEATS IRRITABLY CALLED HER WHO TRANSFORMED HIM IN A FEW MONTHS FROM A POET OF STILL DOUBTFUL FAME INTO A MASTER AND AN IMMORTAL THE ATTACHMENT
7148-59157-0017 SIR SIDNEY THINKS WAS A MISFORTUNE FOR HIM THOUGH HE QUALIFIES THIS BY ADDING THAT SO PROBABLY UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST ANY PASSION FOR A WOMAN HAVE BEEN WELL LET US TEST THIS MISFORTUNE BY ITS CONSEQUENCES
7148-59157-0018 IN JANUARY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN HE WROTE THE EVE OF SAINT AGNES DURING THE SPRING OF THAT YEAR HE WROTE THE ODE TO PSYCHE THE ODE ON A GRECIAN URN THE ODE TO A NIGHTINGALE
7148-59157-0019 AND WROTE THE ODE TO AUTUMN
7148-59157-0020 IN OTHER WORDS PRACTICALLY ALL THE FINE GOLD OF KEATS'S WORK WAS PRODUCED IN THE MONTHS IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR FANNY BRAWNE WAS CONSUMING HIM AS WITH FIRE HIS GREATEST POEMS WE CLEARLY OWE TO THAT HEIGHTENED SENSE OF BEAUTY
7148-59157-0021 WHICH RESULTED FROM HIS TRANSLATION INTO A LOVER IT SEEMS TO ME A TREACHERY TO KEATS'S MEMORY TO BELITTLE A WOMAN WHO WAS AT LEAST THE OCCASION OF SUCH A PASSIONATE EXPENDITURE OF GENIUS SIR SIDNEY COLVIN
7148-59157-0022 DOES HIS BEST TO BE FAIR TO FANNY
7148-59157-0023 AS WELL AS ONE WHO WAS ABLE TO TRANSMUTE IT INTO PERFECT LITERATURE HE SEEMS TO HAVE ADMIRED WOMEN VULGARLY AS CREATURES WHOSE HANDS WERE WAITING TO BE SQUEEZED RATHER THAN AS EQUAL HUMAN BEINGS
7148-59157-0024 WAS ESSENTIALLY A CYNICISM IN THE EXHAUSTED DON JUAN MOOD HENCE KEATS WAS ALMOST DOOMED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH PROVOCATION RATHER THAN WITH WHAT THE VICTORIANS CALLED SOUL HIS DESTINY
7148-59157-0025 WAS NOT TO BE A HAPPY LOVER BUT THE SLAVE OF A MINX IT WAS NOT A SLAVERY WITHOUT DIGNITY HOWEVER IT HAD THE DIGNITY OF TRAGEDY
7148-59157-0026 SIR SIDNEY COLVIN REGRETS THAT THE LOVE LETTERS OF KEATS TO FANNY WERE EVER PUBLISHED IT WOULD BE AS REASONABLE IN MY OPINION
7148-59157-0027 HAS ALMOST NO COUNTERPART IN BIOGRAPHICAL LITERATURE THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING MISS BRAWNE HE WRITES TO BROWN FROM YARMOUTH IS BEYOND EVERYTHING HORRIBLE THE SENSE OF DARKNESS COMING OVER ME
7148-59157-0028 I ETERNALLY SEE HER FIGURE ETERNALLY VANISHING AND WHEN HE REACHES NAPLES HE WRITES TO THE SAME FRIEND I CAN BEAR TO DIE I CANNOT BEAR TO LEAVE HER O GOD
7148-59157-0029 MY IMAGINATION IS HORRIBLY VIVID ABOUT HER I SEE HER I HEAR HER O THAT I COULD BE BURIED NEAR WHERE SHE LIVES I AM AFRAID TO WRITE TO HER
7148-59157-0030 TO RECEIVE A LETTER FROM HER TO SEE HER HANDWRITING WOULD BREAK MY HEART EVEN TO HEAR OF HER ANYHOW TO SEE HER NAME WRITTEN WOULD BE MORE THAN I CAN BEAR
7148-59157-0031 SANS MERCI SIR SIDNEY IS ALL IN FAVOUR AND THERE IS SOMETHING TO BE SAID FOR HIS PREFERENCE OF THE EARLIER VERSION WHICH BEGINS O WHAT CAN AIL THEE KNIGHT AT ARMS ALONE AND PALELY LOITERING
7148-59157-0032 BUT HE DOES NOT PERCEIVE THE REASONS THAT LED KEATS TO ALTER THIS IN THE VERSION HE PUBLISHED IN LEIGH HUNT'S INDICATOR TO AH WHAT CAN AIL THEE WRETCHED WIGHT AND SO ON
7148-59157-0033 TO ACCUSE HUNT OF WISHING TO ALTER KNIGHT AT ARMS TO WRETCHED WIGHT SEEMS TO ME UNWARRANTABLE GUESSING SURELY A MUCH MORE LIKELY EXPLANATION IS THAT KEATS
7148-59157-0034 EVERY EDITION OF KEATS OUGHT TO CONTAIN BOTH VERSIONS JUST AS IT OUGHT TO CONTAIN BOTH VERSIONS OF HYPERION NOTHING THAT I HAVE WRITTEN WILL BE REGARDED I TRUST AS
7148-59157-0035 DEPRECIATING THE ESSENTIAL EXCELLENCE POWER AND IN ITS SCHOLARLY WAY EVEN THE GREATNESS OF SIR SIDNEY COLVIN'S BOOK BUT A CERTAIN FALSE EMPHASIS HERE AND THERE
7148-59157-0036 AND HIS LUXURIOUS LOVE OF BEAUTY
7148-59157-0037 HIS MORBIDNESS HIS MAWKISHNESS HIS FASCINATION AS BY SERPENTS ON THE OTHER BUT IN THE RESULTANT PORTRAIT IT IS A TOO RESPECTABLE AND VIRILE KEATS THAT EMERGES KEATS WAS MORE VIRILE AS A MAN
7148-59157-0038 THAN IS GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD HE DOES NOT OWE HIS IMMORTALITY TO HIS VIRILITY HOWEVER HE OWES IT TO HIS SERVITUDE TO GOLDEN IMAGES TO HIS CITIZENSHIP OF THE WORLD OF THE SENSES TO HIS BONDAGE TO PHYSICAL LOVE
7148-59157-0039 HAD HE LIVED LONGER HE MIGHT HAVE INVADED OTHER WORLDS HIS RECASTING OF HYPERION OPENS WITH A CRY OF DISTRUST IN THE ARTIST WHO IS CONTENT TO LIVE IN THE LITTLE WORLD OF HIS ART
7148-59157-0040 WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN SURPASSED IN LITERATURE THAT HIS OWN ACHIEVEMENT LIES HE IS GREAT AMONG THE PAGANS NOT AMONG THE PROPHETS UNLESS WE KEEP THIS CLEARLY IN MIND OUR PRAISE OF HIM WILL NOT BE APPRECIATION
7148-59157-0041 IT WILL BE BUT A SOUNDING FUNERAL SPEECH INSTEAD OF COMMUNION WITH A LOVELY AND BROKEN SPIRIT
7148-7763-0000 CRISIS IN MY MENTAL HISTORY ONE STAGE ONWARD FOR SOME YEARS AFTER THIS TIME I WROTE VERY LITTLE AND NOTHING REGULARLY FOR PUBLICATION AND GREAT WERE THE ADVANTAGES WHICH I DERIVED FROM THE INTERMISSION
7148-7763-0001 IT WAS OF NO COMMON IMPORTANCE TO ME AT THIS PERIOD TO BE ABLE TO DIGEST AND MATURE MY THOUGHTS FOR MY OWN MIND ONLY WITHOUT ANY IMMEDIATE CALL FOR GIVING THEM OUT IN PRINT HAD I GONE ON WRITING
7148-7763-0002 MIGHT TRULY BE CALLED AN OBJECT IN LIFE TO BE A REFORMER OF THE WORLD MY CONCEPTION OF MY OWN HAPPINESS WAS ENTIRELY IDENTIFIED WITH THIS OBJECT THE PERSONAL SYMPATHIES I WISHED FOR WERE THOSE OF FELLOW LABOURERS
7148-7763-0003 IN THIS ENTERPRISE I ENDEAVOURED TO PICK UP AS MANY FLOWERS AS I COULD BY THE WAY
7148-7763-0004 BUT AS A SERIOUS AND PERMANENT PERSONAL SATISFACTION TO REST UPON MY WHOLE RELIANCE WAS PLACED ON THIS AND I WAS ACCUSTOMED TO FELICITATE MYSELF ON THE CERTAINTY OF A HAPPY LIFE WHICH I ENJOYED
7148-7763-0005 THROUGH PLACING MY HAPPINESS IN SOMETHING DURABLE AND DISTANT IN WHICH SOME PROGRESS MIGHT BE ALWAYS MAKING WHILE IT COULD NEVER BE EXHAUSTED BY COMPLETE ATTAINMENT THIS DID VERY WELL FOR SEVERAL YEARS DURING WHICH THE GENERAL
7148-7763-0006 AS FROM A DREAM IT WAS IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX I WAS IN A DULL STATE OF NERVES SUCH AS EVERYBODY IS OCCASIONALLY LIABLE TO UNSUSCEPTIBLE TO ENJOYMENT OR PLEASURABLE EXCITEMENT ONE OF THOSE MOODS
7148-7763-0007 IN THIS FRAME OF MIND IT OCCURRED TO ME TO PUT THE QUESTION DIRECTLY TO MYSELF SUPPOSE THAT ALL YOUR OBJECTS IN LIFE WERE REALIZED THAT ALL THE CHANGES IN INSTITUTIONS AND OPINIONS WHICH YOU ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO
7148-7763-0008 THE WHOLE FOUNDATION ON WHICH MY LIFE WAS CONSTRUCTED FELL DOWN ALL MY HAPPINESS WAS TO HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THE CONTINUAL PURSUIT OF THIS END THE END HAD CEASED TO CHARM AND HOW COULD THERE EVER AGAIN BE ANY INTEREST IN THE MEANS
7148-7763-0009 I AWOKE TO A RENEWED CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE WOFUL FACT I CARRIED IT WITH ME INTO ALL COMPANIES INTO ALL OCCUPATIONS HARDLY ANYTHING HAD POWER TO CAUSE ME EVEN A FEW MINUTES OBLIVION OF IT
7148-7763-0010 FOR SOME MONTHS THE CLOUD SEEMED TO GROW THICKER AND THICKER THE LINES IN COLERIDGE'S DEJECTION I WAS NOT THEN ACQUAINTED WITH THEM EXACTLY DESCRIBE MY CASE A GRIEF WITHOUT A PANG VOID
7148-7763-0011 IN VAIN I SOUGHT RELIEF FROM MY FAVOURITE BOOKS THOSE MEMORIALS OF PAST NOBLENESS AND GREATNESS FROM WHICH I HAD ALWAYS HITHERTO DRAWN STRENGTH AND ANIMATION I READ THEM NOW WITHOUT FEELING
7148-7763-0012 OR WITH THE ACCUSTOMED FEELING MINUS ALL ITS CHARM AND I BECAME PERSUADED THAT MY LOVE OF MANKIND AND OF EXCELLENCE FOR ITS OWN SAKE HAD WORN ITSELF OUT
7148-7763-0013 I SOUGHT NO COMFORT BY SPEAKING TO OTHERS OF WHAT I FELT IF I HAD LOVED ANYONE SUFFICIENTLY TO MAKE CONFIDING MY GRIEFS A NECESSITY I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE CONDITION I WAS
7148-7763-0014 I FELT TOO THAT MINE WAS NOT AN INTERESTING OR IN ANY WAY RESPECTABLE DISTRESS THERE WAS NOTHING IN IT TO ATTRACT SYMPATHY ADVICE
7148-7763-0015 AND I SAW NO USE IN GIVING HIM THE PAIN OF THINKING THAT HIS PLANS HAD FAILED WHEN THE FAILURE WAS PROBABLY IRREMEDIABLE AND AT ALL EVENTS BEYOND THE POWER OF
7148-7763-0016 HIS REMEDIES OF OTHER FRIENDS I HAD AT THAT TIME NONE TO WHOM I HAD ANY HOPE OF MAKING MY CONDITION INTELLIGIBLE IT WAS HOWEVER ABUNDANTLY INTELLIGIBLE TO MYSELF
7148-7763-0017 AND THE MORE I DWELT UPON IT THE MORE HOPELESS IT APPEARED MY COURSE OF STUDY
7148-7763-0018 WHETHER OF A GOOD OR OF A BAD KIND WERE THE RESULTS OF ASSOCIATION THAT WE LOVE ONE THING AND HATE ANOTHER TAKE PLEASURE IN ONE SORT OF ACTION OR CONTEMPLATION
7148-7763-0019 WITH ALL THINGS BENEFICIAL TO THE GREAT WHOLE
7148-7763-0020 ALL THINGS HURTFUL TO IT THIS DOCTRINE APPEARED INEXPUGNABLE BUT IT NOW SEEMED TO ME ON RETROSPECT THAT MY TEACHERS HAD OCCUPIED THEMSELVES
7148-7763-0021 SALUTARY ASSOCIATIONS THEY SEEMED TO HAVE TRUSTED ALTOGETHER TO THE OLD FAMILIAR INSTRUMENTS PRAISE AND BLAME REWARD AND PUNISHMENT NOW
7148-7763-0022 I DID NOT DOUBT THAT BY THESE MEANS BEGUN EARLY AND APPLIED UNREMITTINGLY INTENSE ASSOCIATIONS OF PAIN AND PLEASURE ESPECIALLY OF PAIN MIGHT BE CREATED
7148-7763-0023 AND MIGHT PRODUCE DESIRES AND AVERSIONS CAPABLE OF LASTING UNDIMINISHED TO THE END OF LIFE BUT THERE MUST ALWAYS BE SOMETHING ARTIFICIAL AND CASUAL IN ASSOCIATIONS THUS PRODUCED
7148-7763-0024 WHAT I HAD ALWAYS BEFORE RECEIVED WITH INCREDULITY THAT THE HABIT OF ANALYSIS HAS A TENDENCY TO WEAR AWAY THE FEELINGS AS INDEED IT HAS WHEN NO OTHER MENTAL HABIT IS CULTIVATED
7148-7763-0025 AND THE ANALYSING SPIRIT REMAINS WITHOUT ITS NATURAL COMPLEMENTS AND CORRECTIVES THE VERY EXCELLENCE OF ANALYSIS I ARGUED IS THAT IT TENDS TO WEAKEN AND UNDERMINE WHATEVER IS THE RESULT OF PREJUDICE
7148-7763-0026 THAT IT ENABLES US MENTALLY TO SEPARATE IDEAS WHICH HAVE ONLY CASUALLY CLUNG TOGETHER AND NO ASSOCIATIONS WHATEVER COULD ULTIMATELY RESIST THIS DISSOLVING FORCE
7148-7763-0027 WERE IT NOT THAT WE OWE TO ANALYSIS OUR CLEAREST KNOWLEDGE OF THE PERMANENT SEQUENCES IN NATURE THE REAL CONNEXIONS BETWEEN THINGS NOT DEPENDENT ON OUR WILL AND FEELINGS NATURAL LAWS BY VIRTUE OF WHICH IN MANY CASES
7148-7763-0028 ONE THING IS INSEPARABLE FROM ANOTHER IN FACT WHICH LAWS IN PROPORTION AS THEY ARE CLEARLY PERCEIVED AND IMAGINATIVELY REALIZED CAUSE OUR IDEAS OF THINGS WHICH ARE ALWAYS JOINED TOGETHER IN NATURE
7148-7763-0029 TO COHERE MORE AND MORE CLOSELY IN OUR THOUGHTS ANALYTIC HABITS MAY THUS EVEN STRENGTHEN THE ASSOCIATIONS BETWEEN CAUSES AND EFFECTS MEANS AND ENDS BUT TEND ALTOGETHER TO WEAKEN THOSE WHICH ARE
7148-7763-0030 TO SPEAK FAMILIARLY A MERE MATTER OF FEELING THEY ARE THEREFORE I THOUGHT FAVOURABLE TO PRUDENCE AND CLEAR SIGHTEDNESS BUT A PERPETUAL WORM AT THE ROOT BOTH OF THE PASSIONS AND OF THE VIRTUES
7148-7763-0031 OF THE ENTIRE INSUFFICIENCY OF WHICH TO MAKE LIFE DESIRABLE NO ONE HAD A STRONGER CONVICTION THAN I HAD THESE WERE THE LAWS OF HUMAN NATURE BY WHICH AS IT SEEMED TO ME
7148-7763-0032 HAD MADE PRECOCIOUS AND PREMATURE ANALYSIS THE INVETERATE HABIT OF MY MIND I WAS THUS AS I SAID TO MYSELF LEFT STRANDED AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF MY VOYAGE WITH A WELL EQUIPPED SHIP
7148-7763-0033 AND A RUDDER BUT NO SAIL WITHOUT ANY REAL DESIRE FOR THE ENDS WHICH I HAD BEEN SO CAREFULLY FITTED OUT TO WORK FOR NO DELIGHT IN VIRTUE OR THE GENERAL GOOD
7148-7763-0034 THE FOUNTAINS OF VANITY AND AMBITION SEEMED TO HAVE DRIED UP WITHIN ME AS COMPLETELY AS THOSE OF BENEVOLENCE I HAD HAD AS I REFLECTED SOME GRATIFICATION OF VANITY AT TOO EARLY AN AGE
7148-7763-0035 AND THERE SEEMED NO POWER IN NATURE SUFFICIENT TO BEGIN THE FORMATION OF MY CHARACTER ANEW AND CREATE IN A MIND NOW IRRETRIEVABLY ANALYTIC
7148-82991-0000 THE BUTCHER AND HOW HE WAS CAST INTO THE VAULT OF THE CURFEW TOWER TURNING OFF ON THE RIGHT THE EARL AND HIS COMPANION CONTINUED TO DESCEND THE HILL UNTIL THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GARTER
7148-82991-0001 THE DOOR OF THE HOSTEL OPENED AND A FAT JOLLY LOOKING PERSONAGE WITH A BALD HEAD AND BUSHY GREY BEARD AND CLAD IN A BROWN SERGE DOUBLET AND HOSE TO MATCH ISSUED FORTH BEARING A FOAMING JUG OF ALE AND A HORN CUP
7148-82991-0002 HIS APPEARANCE WAS WELCOMED BY A JOYFUL SHOUT FROM THE ATTENDANTS COME MY MASTERS HE CRIED FILLING THE HORN HERE IS A CUP OF STOUT WINDSOR ALE IN WHICH TO DRINK THE HEALTH OF OUR JOLLY MONARCH BLUFF KING HAL
7148-82991-0003 AND THERE'S NO HARM I TRUST IN CALLING HIM SO MARRY IS THERE NOT MINE HOST CRIED THE FOREMOST ATTENDANT I SPOKE OF HIM AS SUCH IN HIS OWN HEARING NOT LONG AGO AND HE LAUGHED AT ME
7148-82991-0004 IN RIGHT MERRY SORT I LOVE THE ROYAL BULLY AND WILL DRINK HIS HEALTH GLADLY AND MISTRESS ANNE BOLEYN'S TO BOOT AND HE EMPTIED THE HORN

7178-34644-0000 THE DURABILITY OF FRAGILE THINGS DESTINY SOMETIMES PROFFERS US A GLASS OF MADNESS TO DRINK A HAND IS THRUST OUT OF THE MIST AND SUDDENLY HANDS US THE MYSTERIOUS CUP IN WHICH IS CONTAINED THE LATENT INTOXICATION
7178-34644-0001 GWYNPLAINE DID NOT UNDERSTAND HE LOOKED BEHIND HIM TO SEE WHO IT WAS WHO HAD BEEN ADDRESSED A SOUND MAY BE TOO SHARP TO BE PERCEPTIBLE TO THE EAR
7178-34644-0002 AN EMOTION TOO ACUTE CONVEYS NO MEANING TO THE MIND THERE IS A LIMIT TO COMPREHENSION AS WELL AS TO HEARING THE WAPENTAKE AND THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM APPROACHED GWYNPLAINE AND TOOK HIM BY THE ARMS
7178-34644-0003 HE FELT HIMSELF PLACED IN THE CHAIR WHICH THE SHERIFF HAD JUST VACATED HE LET IT BE DONE WITHOUT SEEKING AN EXPLANATION WHEN GWYNPLAINE WAS SEATED THE JUSTICE OF THE QUORUM AND THE WAPENTAKE RETIRED A FEW STEPS
7178-34644-0004 AND STOOD UPRIGHT AND MOTIONLESS BEHIND THE SEAT THEN THE SHERIFF PLACED HIS BUNCH OF ROSES ON THE STONE TABLE PUT ON SPECTACLES WHICH THE SECRETARY GAVE HIM DREW FROM THE BUNDLES OF PAPERS WHICH COVERED THE TABLE A SHEET OF PARCHMENT

7178-34644-0006 AND IN HIS MOST SOLEMN TONE READ AS FOLLOWS IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER THE SON AND THE HOLY GHOST THIS PRESENT DAY THE TWENTY NINTH OF JANUARY ONE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND NINETIETH YEAR OF OUR LORD
7178-34644-0007 HAS BEEN WICKEDLY DESERTED ON THE DESERT COAST OF PORTLAND WITH THE INTENTION OF ALLOWING HIM TO PERISH OF HUNGER OF COLD AND OF SOLITUDE A CHILD TEN YEARS OLD
7178-34644-0008 THAT CHILD WAS SOLD AT THE AGE OF TWO YEARS BY ORDER OF HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY KING JAMES THE SECOND THAT CHILD IS LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
7178-34644-0009 THE ONLY LEGITIMATE SON OF LORD LINNAEUS CLANCHARLIE BARON CLANCHARLIE AND HUNKERVILLE MARQUIS OF CORLEONE IN SICILY A PEER OF ENGLAND AND OF ANN BRADSHAW HIS WIFE BOTH DECEASED
7178-34644-0010 THAT CHILD IS THE INHERITOR OF THE ESTATES AND TITLES OF HIS FATHER FOR THIS REASON HE WAS SOLD MUTILATED DISFIGURED AND PUT OUT OF THE WAY BY DESIRE OF HIS MOST GRACIOUS MAJESTY

7178-34644-0014 WHICH STAMPS AN EVERLASTING LAUGH UPON THE FACE THE CHILD BY MEANS KNOWN ONLY TO HARDQUANONNE WAS PUT TO SLEEP AND MADE INSENSIBLE DURING ITS PERFORMANCE KNOWING NOTHING OF THE OPERATION WHICH HE UNDERWENT
7178-34644-0015 HE DOES NOT KNOW THAT HE IS LORD CLANCHARLIE HE ANSWERS TO THE NAME OF GWYNPLAINE THIS FACT IS THE RESULT OF HIS YOUTH AND THE SLIGHT POWERS OF MEMORY HE COULD HAVE HAD WHEN HE WAS BOUGHT AND SOLD
7178-34644-0016 BEING THEN BARELY TWO YEARS OLD HARDQUANONNE IS THE ONLY PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO PERFORM THE OPERATION BUCCA FISSA AND THE SAID CHILD IS THE ONLY LIVING SUBJECT UPON WHICH IT HAS BEEN ESSAYED

7178-34645-0028 THE QUEEN'S FATHER HE EVEN WENT SO FAR AS TO JUSTIFY HIM FIRST THERE ARE ANCIENT MONARCHICAL MAXIMS E SENIORATU ERIPIMUS IN ROTURAGIO CADAT
7178-34645-0029 SECONDLY THERE IS A ROYAL RIGHT OF MUTILATION
7178-34645-0030 THE EYES OF DUKES OF THE BLOOD ROYAL HAVE BEEN PLUCKED OUT FOR THE GOOD OF THE KINGDOM CERTAIN PRINCES TOO NEAR TO THE THRONE HAVE BEEN CONVENIENTLY STIFLED BETWEEN MATTRESSES
7178-34645-0031 AND HIS AMBASSADORS HAVE NOT BEEN THE LESS FAVOURABLY RECEIVED BY THE EMPEROR HENCE THE KING MAY ORDER THE SUPPRESSION OF A LIMB LIKE THE SUPPRESSION OF A STATE ET CETERA IT IS LEGAL BUT ONE LAW DOES NOT DESTROY ANOTHER
7178-34645-0032 IF A DROWNED MAN IS CAST UP BY THE WATER AND IS NOT DEAD IT IS AN ACT OF GOD READJUSTING ONE OF THE KING IF THE HEIR BE FOUND LET THE CORONET BE GIVEN BACK TO HIM
7178-34645-0033 THUS SHOULD BE DONE TO GWYNPLAINE WHO IS ALSO A KING SEEING THAT HE IS A PEER
7178-34645-0034 UNDER CONSTRAINT OF SUPERIOR POWER DOES NOT TARNISH THE BLAZON AS IN THE CASE OF ABDOLMUMEN WHO WAS A KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A GARDENER THAT OF JOSEPH WHO WAS A SAINT ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A CARPENTER
7178-34645-0035 THAT OF APOLLO WHO WAS A GOD ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN A SHEPHERD IN SHORT THE LEARNED CHANCELLOR CONCLUDED BY ADVISING THE REINSTATEMENT IN ALL HIS ESTATES AND DIGNITIES OF LORD FERMAIN CLANCHARLIE
7178-34645-0036 MISCALLED GWYNPLAINE ON THE SOLE CONDITION THAT HE SHOULD BE CONFRONTED WITH THE CRIMINAL HARDQUANONNE AND IDENTIFIED BY THE SAME AND ON THIS POINT THE CHANCELLOR AS CONSTITUTIONAL KEEPER OF THE ROYAL CONSCIENCE
7178-34645-0037 BASED THE ROYAL DECISION THE LORD CHANCELLOR ADDED IN A POSTSCRIPT
7178-34645-0038 FOR IF THE PRISONER DIES ON THE SECOND OR THIRD DAY THE CONFRONTATION BECOMES DIFFICULT STILL THE LAW MUST BE OBEYED
7190-90542-0000 THE IDENTITY OF THE FINAL VICTIM
7190-90542-0001 AS AN EXCUSE I TALKED OVER CASES WITH HIM BUT HE SELDOM VOLUNTEERED AN OPINION OFTEN WAS OBVIOUSLY UNINTERESTED TRUTH TO TELL I WAS NOT THERE FOR HIS OPINION BUT TO SEE HIS GRANDDAUGHTER A DETECTIVE IN LOVE SOUNDS SOMETHING LIKE AN ABSURDITY
7190-90542-0002 BUT SUCH WAS MY CASE AND SINCE ZENA'S MANNER DID NOT SUGGEST THAT SHE WAS PARTICULARLY INTERESTED IN ME MY LOVE AFFAIR SEEMED RATHER A HOPELESS ONE MY ASSOCIATION WITH CHRISTOPHER QUARLES HAS HOWEVER
7190-90542-0003 LED TO THE SOLUTION OF SOME STRANGE MYSTERIES AND SINCE MY OWN ACHIEVEMENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY WELL KNOWN I MAY CONFINE MYSELF TO THOSE CASES WHICH SINGLE HANDED I SHOULD HAVE FAILED TO SOLVE I KNOW THAT IN MANY OF THEM I WAS CREDITED WITH HAVING UNRAVELED THE MYSTERY
7190-90542-0004 BUT THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE PROFESSOR QUARLES PERSISTED IN REMAINING IN THE BACKGROUND IF I DID THE SPADE WORK THE DEDUCTIONS WERE HIS THEY WERE ALL CASES WITH PECULIAR FEATURES IN THEM
7190-90542-0005 HE WAS OFTEN AS ASTONISHED AT MY ACUMEN IN FOLLOWING A CLEW AS I WAS AT HIS MARVELOUS THEORIES
7190-90542-0006 PERHAPS HIS CURIOUS POWER WAS NEVER MORE NOTICEABLE THAN IN THE CASE OF THE WITHAN MURDER A FARMER RETURNING FROM MEDWORTH THE NEIGHBORING MARKET TOWN ONE NIGHT IN JANUARY
7190-90542-0007 BY EVENING THE CLOUDS HAD GONE THE MOON SAILED IN A CLEAR SKY AND LOOKING ROUND TO FIND THE CAUSE OF HIS HORSE'S UNUSUAL BEHAVIOR THE FARMER SAW A MAN LYING ON A HEAP OF SNOW UNDER THE OPPOSITE HEDGE HE WAS DEAD MORE HE WAS HEADLESS
7190-90542-0008 IT WAS NOT UNTIL SOME DAYS LATER THAT THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND IN THE INTERVAL THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES HAD NOT BEEN IDLE IT WAS NOTED THAT THE MAN WAS POORLY DRESSED THAT HIS HANDS PROVED HE WAS USED TO MANUAL LABOR BUT THERE WAS NO MARK EITHER ON HIS BODY OR ON HIS CLOTHING
7190-90542-0009 NOR ANY PAPERS IN HIS POCKETS TO LEAD TO HIS IDENTIFICATION SO FAR AS COULD BE ASCERTAINED
7190-90542-0010 AND APPARENTLY NO STRUGGLE HAD TAKEN PLACE FOOTPRINTS NEARLY OBLITERATED
7190-90542-0011 SOON AFTER THE STORM BEGAN AND THAT SNOW HAD HIDDEN THE MURDERER'S TRACKS FROM THE WOOD THAT SNOW HAD DRIFTED ON TO THE DEAD BODY SEEMED TO ESTABLISH THIS THEORY
7190-90542-0012 AND WOULD BE FOUND BURIED IN THE WOOD IT WAS NOT FOUND HOWEVER AND THE COUNTRYSIDE WAS IN A STATE BORDERING ON PANIC FOR A FEW DAYS THE WITHAN MURDER SEEMED UNIQUE IN ATROCITIES AND THEN CAME A COMMUNICATION FROM THE FRENCH POLICE
7190-90542-0013 SOME TWO YEARS AGO AN ALMOST IDENTICAL MURDER HAD BEEN COMMITTED OUTSIDE A VILLAGE IN NORMANDY IN THIS CASE ALSO THE HEAD WAS MISSING AND NOTHING HAD BEEN FOUND UPON THE BODY TO IDENTIFY THE VICTIM HE WAS WELL DRESSED AND A MAN WHO WOULD BE LIKELY TO CARRY PAPERS WITH HIM BUT NOTHING WAS FOUND
7190-90542-0014 AND THE MURDER HAD REMAINED A MYSTERY THESE WERE THE POINTS KNOWN AND CONJECTURED WHEN THE CASE CAME INTO MY HANDS AND MY INVESTIGATIONS ADDED LITTLE TO THEM ONE POINT HOWEVER IMPRESSED ME I FELT CONVINCED THAT THE MAN'S CLOTHES WHICH WERE SHOWN TO ME HAD NOT BEEN MADE IN ENGLAND
7190-90542-0015 THEY WERE POOR WORN ALMOST THREADBARE BUT THEY HAD ONCE BEEN FAIRLY GOOD AND THE CUT WAS NOT ENGLISH THAT IT WAS FRENCH I COULD NOT POSSIBLY AFFIRM BUT IT MIGHT BE AND SO I FASHIONED A FRAGILE LINK WITH THE NORMANDY CRIME
7190-90542-0016 ON THIS OCCASION I WENT TO QUARLES WITH THE OBJECT OF INTERESTING HIM IN THE WITHAN CASE AND HE FORESTALLED ME BY BEGINNING TO TALK ABOUT IT THE MOMENT I ENTERED THE ROOM HERE I MAY MENTION A FACT WHICH I HAD NOT DISCOVERED AT FIRST
7190-90542-0017 WHENEVER HE WAS INTERESTED IN A CASE I WAS ALWAYS TAKEN INTO HIS EMPTY ROOM AT OTHER TIMES WE WERE IN THE DINING ROOM OR THE DRAWING ROOM IT WAS THE EMPTY ROOM ON THIS OCCASION AND ZENA REMAINED WITH US
7190-90542-0018 THE FOREIGN CUT OF THE CLOTHES MAY BE OF IMPORTANCE HE SAID I AM NOT SURE IS THIS WOOD YOU MENTION OF ANY GREAT EXTENT NO IT RUNS BESIDE THE ROAD FOR TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS TOWARD WITHAN NO IT WAS NEAR THE WITHAN END OF IT THAT THE DEAD MAN WAS FOUND
7190-90542-0019 ANY TRACES THAT THE HEAD WAS CARRIED TO THE WOOD THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES SAY YES AND NOT A TRACE AFTERWARD THE GROUND IN THE WOOD WAS SEARCHED AT THE TIME AND I HAVE BEEN OVER IT CAREFULLY SINCE THROUGH ONE PART OF THE WOOD THERE RUNS A DITCH
7190-90542-0020 WHICH IS CONTINUED AS A DIVISION BETWEEN TWO FIELDS WHICH FORM PART OF THE FARM LAND BEHIND THE WOOD BY WALKING ALONG THIS THE MURDERER MIGHT HAVE LEFT THE WOOD WITHOUT LEAVING TRACKS BEHIND HIM A GOOD POINT WIGAN AND WHERE WOULD THAT DITCH LEAD HIM EVENTUALLY TO THE HIGH ROAD
7190-90542-0021 WHICH RUNS ALMOST AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE WITHAN ROAD MUCH WATER IN THE DITCH ASKED QUARLES HALF A FOOT WHEN I WENT THERE
7190-90542-0022 THERE WAS A MOON THAT NIGHT WASN'T THERE FULL OR NEAR IT I RETURNED AND HOW SOON WAS THE ALARM RAISED ALONG THE COUNTRYSIDE
7190-90542-0023 AND AFTER GOING TO THE VILLAGE THE FARMER RETURNED TO MEDWORTH FOR THE POLICE
7190-90542-0024 SAID ZENA AND IF HE WERE MET ON THE ROAD CARRYING A BAG HE WOULD ARREST ATTENTION WHY CARRYING A BAG ASKED QUARLES WITH THE HEAD IN IT SHE ANSWERED THAT'S ANOTHER GOOD POINT WIGAN CHUCKLED QUARLES OF COURSE
7190-90542-0025 THE HEAD MAY BE BURIED IN THE WOOD SAID ZENA QUARLES LOOKED AT ME INQUIRINGLY
7190-90542-0026 ONE OR TWO DOUBTFUL PLACES I HAD DUG UP I THINK THE MURDERER MUST HAVE TAKEN THE HEAD WITH HIM TO BURY SOMEWHERE ELSE ASKED QUARLES
7190-90542-0027 A MAD DOCTOR BENT ON BRAIN EXPERIMENTS IS THAT YOUR THEORY WIGAN
7190-90542-0028 JANUARY THE SEVENTEENTH NEARLY THE SAME DATE AS THE ENGLISH ONE SAID ZENA TWO YEARS INTERVENING I RETURNED
7190-90542-0029 AT THAT DATE SAID QUARLES YOU HAVE A THEORY PROFESSOR AN OUTLANDISH ONE WHICH WOULD MAKE YOU LAUGH NO NO I DO NOT LIKE BEING LAUGHED AT I NEVER MENTION MY THEORIES UNTIL I HAVE SOME FACTS TO SUPPORT THEM
7190-90542-0030 I TOOK THE TROUBLE TO MAKE INQUIRY WHETHER ANY SIMILAR CRIME HAD HAPPENED IN ENGLAND IN THE JANUARY OF THE PRECEDING YEAR AND HAD THE SAME INQUIRY MADE IN FRANCE THERE WAS NO RECORD OF ANY MURDER BEARING THE SLIGHTEST RESEMBLANCE TO THE WITHAN TRAGEDY
7190-90542-0031 A FEW DAYS LATER QUARLES TELEGRAPHED ME TO MEET HIM AT KINGS CROSS AND WE TRAVELED NORTH TOGETHER WAIT HE SAID WHEN I BEGAN TO QUESTION HIM I AM NOT SURE YET MY THEORY SEEMS ABSURD WE ARE GOING TO FIND OUT IF IT IS
7190-90542-0032 WE TOOK ROOMS AT A HOTEL IN MEDWORTH QUARLES EXPLAINING THAT OUR INVESTIGATIONS MIGHT TAKE SOME DAYS NEXT MORNING INSTEAD OF GOING TO WITHAN AS I HAD EXPECTED HE TOOK ME TO THE POLICE COURT
7190-90542-0033 THE NEXT AFTERNOON HE ARRANGED A DRIVE I THOUGHT WE WERE GOING TO WITHAN BUT WE TURNED AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE AND PRESENTLY QUARLES STOPPED THE CARRIAGE
7190-90542-0034 FIVE OR SIX MILES THE ROAD WINDS A LOT IT'S A DEAL NEARER AS THE CROW FLIES YOU NEED NOT WAIT FOR US DRIVER MY FRIEND AND I ARE GOING TO WALK BACK THE COACHMAN POCKETED HIS MONEY AND DROVE AWAY COULDN'T KEEP HIM WAITING ALL NIGHT AS WE MAY HAVE TO DO
7190-90542-0035 SAID QUARLES MIND YOU WIGAN I'M VERY DOUBTFUL ABOUT MY THEORY AT LEAST I AM NOT CERTAIN THAT I SHALL FIND THE FACTS I WANT A FEW HOURS WILL SETTLE IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AFTER WALKING ALONG THE ROAD FOR ABOUT A MILE
7190-90542-0036 QUARLES SCRAMBLED THROUGH A HEDGE INTO A WOOD BY THE ROADSIDE
7190-90542-0037 SHOULD WE MEET ANYONE BLAME ME SAY I AM A DODDERING OLD FOOL WHO WOULD WALK UNDER THE TREES
7190-90542-0038 DO YOU GO ARMED ALWAYS I ANSWERED I DO SOMETIMES HE SAID TAPPING HIS POCKET WE MIGHT COME UP AGAINST DANGER IF MY THEORY IS CORRECT IF I TELL YOU TO SHOOT SHOOT AND QUICKLY
7190-90542-0039 YOUR LIFE IS LIKELY TO DEPEND UPON IT AND KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN TO MAKE SURE NO ONE IS FOLLOWING US HE HAD BECOME KEEN LIKE A DOG ON THE TRAIL AND OLD AS HE WAS SEEMED INCAPABLE OF FATIGUE
7190-90542-0040 WHETHER HE HAD STUDIED THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD I CANNOT SAY BUT HE DID NOT HESITATE IN HIS DIRECTION UNTIL HE REACHED A HIGH KNOLL WHICH WAS CLEAR OF THE WOOD AND COMMANDED A CONSIDERABLE VIEW WE WERE TRESPASSERS IN A PRIVATE PARK
7190-90542-0041 TO OUR RIGHT WAS A LARGE HOUSE ONLY PARTIALLY SEEN THROUGH ITS SCREEN OF TREES BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY MELLOW WITH AGE TO OUR LEFT TOWARD WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY THE EXTREMITY OF THE PARK WAS HILLY GROUND WHICH HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO RUN WILD
7190-90542-0042 TO THIS QUARLES POINTED THAT IS OUR WAY HE SAID WE'LL USE WHAT COVER WE CAN WE PLUNGED INTO THE WOOD AGAIN AND WERE SOON IN THE WILDERNESS FORCING OUR WAY SOMETIMES WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THROUGH THE UNDERGROWTH
7190-90542-0043 ONCE OR TWICE THE PROFESSOR GAVE ME A WARNING GESTURE BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK HE HAD EVIDENTLY SOME DEFINITE GOAL AND I WAS CONSCIOUS OF EXCITEMENT AS I FOLLOWED HIM FOR AN HOUR OR MORE HE TURNED THIS WAY AND THAT EXPLORING EVERY LITTLE RAVINE HE COULD DISCOVER
7190-90542-0044 GRUNTING HIS DISAPPOINTMENT EACH TIME HE FAILED TO FIND WHAT HE WAS LOOKING FOR I SAID I WASN'T CERTAIN HE WHISPERED WHEN OUR PATH HAD LED US INTO A DAMP HOLLOW WHICH LOOKED AS IF IT HAD NOT BEEN VISITED BY MAN FOR CENTURIES MY THEORY SEEMS
7190-90542-0045 AND YET THIS IS SUCH A LIKELY PLACE THERE MUST BE A WAY HE WAS GOING FORWARD AGAIN THE HOLLOW WAS SURROUNDED BY PERPENDICULAR WALLS OF SAND AND CHALK IT WAS A PIT IN FACT WHICH NATURE HAD FILLED WITH VEGETATION THE WAY WE HAD COME SEEMED THE ONLY WAY INTO IT
7190-90542-0046 AH THIS LOOKS PROMISING QUARLES SAID SUDDENLY IN A CORNER OF THE WALL OR TO BE MORE PRECISE FILLING UP A RENT IN IT WAS A SHED ROUGHLY BUILT BUT WITH A DOOR SECURED BY A VERY BUSINESS LIKE LOCK I THINK THE SHED IS CLIMBABLE
7190-90542-0047 SAID QUARLES LET'S GET ON THE ROOF I AM NOT SO YOUNG AS I WAS SO HELP ME UP IT WAS NOT MUCH HELP HE WANTED IN A FEW MOMENTS WE WERE ON THE ROOF AS I THOUGHT HE SAID
7190-90542-0048 WE'LL GO CAREFULLY SAID QUARLES THERE MAY BE WORSE THAN POACHERS TRAPS HERE WITHOUT HELP FROM ME HE DROPPED FROM THE ROOF AND I FOLLOWED HIM THE NATURAL PASSAGE WAS WINDING AND ABOUT FIFTY YARDS LONG AND OPENED INTO ANOTHER PIT OF SOME SIZE
7190-90542-0049 A PIT I CALL IT BUT IT WAS AS MUCH A CAVE AS A PIT PART OF IT RUNNING DEEPLY INTO THE EARTH AND ONLY ABOUT A THIRD OF IT BEING OPEN TO THE SKY THE CAVE PART HAD A ROUGH SANDY FLOOR AND HERE WAS A LONG SHED OF PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION
7190-90542-0050 THE BACK PART BEING CLOSED IN THE ROOF WAS THATCHED WITH BARK AND DRIED BRACKEN AND AGAINST ONE END OF THE VERANDA WAS A NOTCHED TREE TRUNK SERVING AS A LADDER AS I EXPECTED SAID QUARLES WITH SOME EXCITEMENT WE MUST GET ONTO THE VERANDA FOR A MOMENT
7190-90542-0051 I THINK WE ARE ALONE HERE BUT KEEP YOUR EARS OPEN THE SHED WAS EVIDENTLY USED SOMETIMES THERE WAS A STONE SLAB WHICH HAD SERVED AS A FIREPLACE AND FROM A BEAM ABOVE HUNG A SHORT CHAIN ON WHICH A POT COULD EASILY BE FIXED WE'LL GET AWAY QUICKLY SAID QUARLES
7190-90542-0052 WHEN IN ABOUT THIRTY HOURS TIME THE PROFESSOR'S SENSE OF DIRECTION WAS MARVELOUS
7190-90542-0053 I DARESAY ONE WOULD BE ALLOWED TO SEE OVER THE HOUSE
7190-90542-0054 HE WAS ALWAYS AS SECRET AS THE GRAVE UNTIL HE HAD PROVED HIS THEORY AND THEN HE SEEMED ANXIOUS TO FORGET THE WHOLE AFFAIR AND SHRANK FROM PUBLICITY
7190-90542-0055 WE GO THERE AGAIN THIS EVENING HE SAID AFTER LUNCH NEXT DAY SO A RESTFUL AFTERNOON WILL SUIT US IT WAS GETTING DARK WHEN WE SET OUT AND AGAIN QUARLES'S UNERRING SENSE OF LOCALITY ASTONISHED ME HE LED THE WAY WITHOUT HESITATION
7190-90542-0056 I THINK WE ARE FIRST BUT GREAT CARE IS NECESSARY HE WHISPERED WE CREPT FORWARD AND CONCEALED OURSELVES AMONG THE SCRUB VEGETATION WHICH GREW IN THAT PART OF THE PIT WHICH WAS OPEN TO THE SKY IT WAS DARK THE LONG SHED BARELY DISCERNIBLE
7190-90542-0057 BUT THE PROFESSOR WAS PARTICULAR ABOUT OUR POSITION WE MAY HAVE TO CREEP A LITTLE NEARER PRESENTLY HE WHISPERED FROM HERE WE CAN DO SO SILENCE WIGAN AND DON'T BE ASTONISHED AT ANYTHING THE WAITING SEEMED LONG MOONLIGHT WAS PRESENTLY ABOVE US
7190-90542-0058 THROWING THE CAVE PART OF THE PIT INTO GREATER SHADOW THAN EVER I CANNOT ATTEMPT TO SAY HOW LONG WE HAD WAITED IN UTTER SILENCE WHEN QUARLES TOUCHED MY ARM SOMEONE WAS COMING AND WITH NO PARTICULAR STEALTH
7190-90542-0059 I HEARD FOOTSTEPS ON THE RAISED FLOOR OF THE SHED A MAN'S STEP AND ONLY ONE MAN'S I HEARD HIM MOVING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME I THINK HE CAME DOWN THE LADDER ONCE AND WENT UP AGAIN
7190-90542-0060 THEN THERE WAS A LIGHT AND SUDDEN TINY FLAMES IN THE DARK HE HAD EVIDENTLY GOT FUEL AND HAD STARTED A FIRE ON THE STONE SLAB AS THE FLAMES BRIGHTENED I WATCHED HIS RESTLESS FIGURE HE WAS NOT A YOUNG MAN
7190-90542-0061 HE WAS SHORT THICK SET AND QUICK IN HIS MOVEMENTS
7190-90542-0062 WHEN HE GOT DOWN AGAIN I SAW THAT A BUNDLE WAS SUSPENDED OVER THE FIRE
7190-90542-0063 ONLY THE SMOKE CURLED ABOUT IT THEN THE MAN MOVED THE WOODEN BLOCK TO THE SIDE OF THE FIRE AND SAT DOWN FACING US THE FLICKERING FLAMES THROWING A RED GLOW OVER HIM WIGAN DO YOU SEE WHISPERED QUARLES NOT CLEARLY WE'LL GO NEARER CAREFULLY
7190-90542-0064 FROM OUR NEW POINT OF VIEW I LOOKED AGAIN THE MAN'S FACE WAS FAMILIAR BUT JUST THEN I COULD NOT REMEMBER WHO HE WAS IT WAS THE BUNDLE HANGING OVER THE FIRE WHICH FASCINATED ME TIED TOGETHER AND SECURED IN A NETWORK OF STRING
7190-90542-0065 WERE FIVE OR SIX HUMAN HEADS BLACKENED SHRIVELED FACES WHICH SEEMED TO GRIN HORRIBLY AS THEY SWUNG DEEPLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE LIT UP BY THE FLICKER OF THE FLAMES DO YOU SEE WIGAN QUARLES ASKED AGAIN YES
7190-90542-0066 AND THE MAN WHO IS HE ON THE BENCH YESTERDAY SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM
7190-90542-0067 FOR AN HOUR TWO THREE I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG THAT HORRIBLE BUNDLE SWUNG OVER THE FIRE AND THE MAN SAT ON HIS BLOCK OF WOOD STARING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7190-90542-0068 AND I WAITED EXPECTING SOME FURTHER REVELATION LISTENING FOR OTHER FOOTSTEPS NONE CAME THE FIRE FLICKERED LOWER AND WENT OUT THE MOON HAD SET AND THE COLD OF THE EARLY MORNING GOT INTO MY BONES
7190-90542-0069 IN THE DARKNESS BEFORE THE DAWN THE MAN MOVED ABOUT THE SHED AGAIN AND PRESENTLY I HEARD HIM GO PATIENCE WHISPERED QUARLES AS I STARTED UP TO GO AFTER HIM HE WILL NOT RUN AWAY
7190-90542-0070 MY DEAR WIGAN HE SAID WHEN AT LAST HE CONDESCENDED TO TALK IT WAS ZENA WHO FIRST SET ME ON THE RIGHT ROAD WHEN SHE REMARKED THAT A MAN WHO HAD WALKED IN A DITCH CARRYING A BAG WOULD ARREST ATTENTION TWO POINTS WERE SUGGESTED FIRST
7190-90542-0071 THAT THE MAN MIGHT NOT HAVE FAR TO GO TO REACH A PLACE OF SAFETY SECONDLY THAT HE HAD COME PREPARED TO TAKE A HEAD AWAY WITH HIM A MERE SPECULATION YOU MAY SAY
7190-90542-0072 WHY SHOULD A HEAD BE REQUIRED WHAT KIND OF MAN WOULD BE LIKELY TO WANT A HEAD
7190-90542-0073 I SOUGHT FOR SOME PECULIARITY IN HIS MANNER AND FOUND NONE YET HIS HISTORY COINCIDED WITH MY THEORY YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM I SUPPOSE NOTHING RATHER AN INTERESTING CAREER BUT WITH AN HEREDITARY TAINT IN IT QUARLES WENT ON
7190-90542-0074 HIS MOTHER WAS ECCENTRIC HER HUSBAND WAS RICH ENOUGH TO HAVE HER LOOKED AFTER AT HOME HAD SHE BEEN A POORER PERSON SHE WOULD HAVE DIED IN A MADHOUSE RELIGIOUS MANIA HERS WAS AND HER SON HAS INHERITED IT IN A CURIOUS FASHION
7190-90542-0075 HOW HAVE YOU LEARNT ALL THIS HE IS IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO HAVE SOME OF HIS DOINGS CHRONICLED AND HE WROTE SOME INTERESTING ARTICLES FOR A COUNTRY GENTLEMEN'S NEWSPAPER ABOUT HIS NORMANDY TOUR NATURE STUDIES AND SUCH LIKE ANOTHER POINT BOTH THESE MURDERS HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE FULL MOON
7190-90542-0076 I AM NOT ABSOLUTELY SURE BUT I THINK YOU WILL FIND THAT FOR THE LAST HALF DOZEN YEARS SIR HENRY HAS NOT BEEN IN ENGLAND IN JANUARY YOU THINK I THINK THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHER HEADS MISSING IF HE HAD BEEN QUARLES ANSWERED
7190-90542-0077 HE WAS SANE ENOUGH TO BE SOMEWHERE WHERE HE WAS NOT KNOWN WHEN THIS TIME OF THE YEAR CAME ROUND AT THE FULL MOON HE IS ALWAYS QUEER WITNESS LAST NIGHT BUT HE IS ONLY DANGEROUS IN JANUARY DANGEROUS I MEAN WITHOUT PROVOCATION
7190-90542-0078 TO PRESERVE HIS SECRET I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HE WOULD GO TO ANY LENGTH THAT IS WHY I WARNED YOU TO BE READY TO SHOOT WHEN WE WENT UPON OUR JOURNEY OF DISCOVERY NOW THIS YEAR HE WAS IN ENGLAND ILLNESS HAD KEPT HIM TO HIS HOUSE YONDER
7190-90542-0079 AND THE INSANE DESIRE PROVED IRRESISTIBLE HE WAS CUNNING TOO HE MUST KNOW EVERYBODY IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD YET THE MAN HE KILLED WAS UNKNOWN WE SHALL FIND PRESENTLY I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE VICTIM WAS SOME WANDERER RETURNING UNEXPECTEDLY TO FRIENDS IN WITHAN
7190-90542-0080 SIR HENRY WAITING IN THE WOOD PERHAPS FOR HOURS MAY HAVE ALLOWED OTHERS TO PASS BEFORE THIS MAN CAME HE REALIZED THAT HE WAS A STRANGER AND ATTACKED HIM BUT THE HEAD
7190-90542-0081 WAS AMONG THOSE HANGING OVER THE FIRE SIR HENRY WAS FOR MANY YEARS IN BORNEO WIGAN AND FOR A LARGE PART OF THE TIME WAS UP COUNTRY HELPING TO PUT DOWN THE HEAD HUNTING WHICH STILL EXISTED THERE AND STILL DOES EXIST ACCORDING TO ALL ACCOUNTS WHEN THE NATIVES THINK THEY CAN ESCAPE DETECTION
7190-90542-0082 THE HORRIBLE CUSTOM PROVED TOO MUCH FOR HIS DISEASED BRAIN AND FASCINATED HIM YOU SEE HOW MY THEORY GREW THEN I LOOKED FOR THE ACTUAL PROOF WHICH WE FOUND LAST NIGHT
7190-90542-0083 THE ARREST OF SIR HENRY BUCKINGHAM CAUSED AN ENORMOUS SENSATION HE WAS SUBSEQUENTLY PUT INTO A LUNATIC ASYLUM WHERE HE DIED NOT MANY MONTHS AFTERWARD FORTUNATELY HE HAD NO CHILDREN TO RUN THE RISK OF MADNESS IN THEIR TURN
7190-90543-0000 HOWEVER OBSCURE A MYSTERY MAY BE THERE IS ALWAYS SOME POINT OR CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IF RIGHTLY INTERPRETED WILL LEAD TO ITS SOLUTION EVEN IN THOSE CRIMES WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN ELUCIDATED THIS POINT EXISTS ONLY IT HAS NEVER BEEN DULY APPRECIATED
7190-90543-0001 FOR WHICH THE DETECTIVE FIRST LOOKS AND SINCE FEW CRIMES IF ANY ARE COMMITTED WITHOUT SOME DEFINITE REASON IT IS MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND IN THE MOTIVE HIS ALMOST SUPERHUMAN POWER OF RECOGNIZING THIS KEY CLEW WAS THE FOUNDATION OF CHRISTOPHER QUARLES'S SUCCESS
7190-90543-0002 AND HIS SOLUTION OF THE MYSTERIOUS BURGLARIES WHICH CAUSED SUCH SPECULATION FOR A TIME WAS NOT THE LEAST OF HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD THE EMINENT PHYSICIAN OF HARLEY STREET HAD GIVEN A SMALL DINNER PARTY ONE EVENING THE GUESTS LEFT EARLY
7190-90543-0003 AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT THE HOUSEHOLD HAD RETIRED NEITHER SIR JOSEPH NOR LADY MAYNARD NOR ANY OF THE SERVANTS WERE DISTURBED DURING THE NIGHT BUT NEXT MORNING IT WAS FOUND THAT BURGLARS HAD ENTERED THEY HAD GOT IN BY A PASSAGE WINDOW AT THE BACK
7190-90543-0004 NOT A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER AND HAD EVIDENTLY GONE TO THE DINING ROOM AND HELPED THEMSELVES TO SPIRITS FROM A TANTALUS WHICH WAS ON THE SIDEBOARD THREE GLASSES WITH A LITTLE OF THE LIQUOR LEFT IN THEM WERE ON THE TABLE AND NEAR THEM WERE SOME BISCUIT CRUMBS
7190-90543-0005 THERE WERE SEVERAL SILVER ARTICLES ON THE SIDEBOARD BUT THESE HAD NOT BEEN TOUCHED THE BURGLARS APPEARED TO HAVE GIVEN ALL THEIR ATTENTION TO SIR JOSEPH'S ROOM WHICH WAS IN A STATE OF CONFUSION TWO CUPBOARDS AND EVERY DRAWER HAD BEEN TURNED OUT AND THE CONTENTS THROWN ABOUT IN ALL DIRECTIONS
7190-90543-0006 BUT OF AN OLD FASHIONED TYPE PRESENTING LITTLE DIFFICULTY TO EXPERTS IN IT BESIDES PAPERS AND ABOUT SEVENTY POUNDS IN GOLD IN A CANVAS BAG
7190-90543-0007 PRESENTATIONS WHICH HAD BEEN MADE TO HIM AND SOME UNIQUE SPECIMENS OF THE QUEEN ANNE PERIOD ALL THIS SILVER WAS UPON THE FLOOR ALSO THE BAG OF MONEY INTACT
7190-90543-0008 IT LOOKED AS IF THE BOX HAD BEEN KNOCKED DOWN AND TRODDEN ON BY MISTAKE FOR THE COUNTERS WERE IN A LITTLE HEAP CLOSE TO THE BROKEN FRAGMENTS IT APPEARED THAT THE BURGLARS MUST HAVE BEEN DISTURBED AND HAD MADE OFF WITHOUT SECURING THEIR BOOTY
7190-90543-0009 THIS WAS THE OBVIOUS EXPLANATION BUT IT DID NOT SATISFY ME I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HAD HE ANY DOCUMENT WHICH FOR PRIVATE OR PUBLIC REASONS SOMEONE MIGHT BE ANXIOUS TO OBTAIN HE SAID HE HAD NOT
7190-90543-0010 WAS INCLINED TO LAUGH AT MY QUESTION AND PROCEEDED TO INFORM ME THAT HE HAD NO FAMILY SKELETON
7190-90543-0011 HAD NEVER BEEN IN TOUCH WITH ANY MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY
7190-90543-0012 BUT THERE WERE CERTAIN POINTS AGAINST THIS IDEA NO ONE HAD MOVED ABOUT THE HOUSE DURING THE NIGHT
7190-90543-0013 THE SILVER ON THE FLOOR WAS SCATTERED
7190-90543-0014 AND IT LOOKED AS IF IT HAD BEEN THROWN ASIDE CARELESSLY AS THOUGH IT WERE NOT WHAT THE THIEVES WERE IN SEARCH OF AND SURELY HAD THEY LEFT IN A HURRY THE BAG OF MONEY WOULD HAVE BEEN TAKEN
7190-90543-0015 MOREOVER THE CIGARETTE ENDS AND THE DIRTY GLASSES SUGGESTED A CERTAIN LEISURELY METHOD OF GOING TO WORK AND MEN OF THIS KIND WOULD NOT BE EASILY FRIGHTENED THE CIGARETTE ENDS PUZZLED ME THEY WERE OF A CHEAP AMERICAN BRAND
7190-90543-0016 HAD NOT BEEN TAKEN FROM SIR JOSEPH'S BOX WHICH CONTAINED ONLY TURKISH ONES AND ALTHOUGH THEY HAD APPARENTLY BEEN THROWN DOWN CARELESSLY THERE WAS NO ASH UPON THE CARPET NOR ANYWHERE ELSE
7190-90543-0017 IF MY IDEA WERE CORRECT IT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY HAD BEEN PUT THERE ON PURPOSE TO MISLEAD I EXAMINED THE THREE GLASSES ON THE DINING ROOM TABLE THERE WAS THE STAIN OF LIPS AT THE RIM OF ONE BUT NOT OF THE OTHER TWO ONLY ONE HAD BEEN DRUNK OUT OF
7190-90543-0018 AND PROBABLY A LITTLE OF THE LIQUID HAD BEEN EMPTIED OUT OF THIS INTO THE OTHER TWO ON INQUIRY ONE OF THE SERVANTS TOLD ME THAT ONLY A VERY LITTLE OF THE SPIRIT HAD BEEN TAKEN SHE ALSO SAID THERE WAS ONLY ONE BISCUIT LEFT IN THE BOX LAST NIGHT AND IT WAS THERE NOW
7190-90543-0019 BY DOING SO I CERTAINLY SAVED ONE VALUABLE LIFE POSSIBLY MORE THAN ONE THAT HE WAS INTERESTED WAS SHOWN BY OUR ADJOURNMENT TO THE EMPTY ROOM
7190-90543-0020 HE SAID I THINK THERE WAS ONLY ONE BURGLAR BUT FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT THAT IT SHOULD BE BELIEVED THERE WERE MORE A VERY IMPORTANT POINT AND A REASONABLE CONCLUSION I FANCY SAID QUARLES IF YOU ARE RIGHT IT NARROWS THE SPHERE OF INQUIRY
7190-90543-0021 NARROWS IT VERY MUCH TAKEN WITH THE OTHER FACTS OF THE CASE EXACTLY I ANSWERED THERE IS A SUGGESTION TO MY MIND OF AMATEURISHNESS IN THE AFFAIR I GRANT THE SAFE WAS NOT A DIFFICULT ONE TO BREAK OPEN BUT IT HAD NOT BEEN DONE IN A VERY EXPERT MANNER
7190-90543-0022 THE CIGARETTE ENDS THE DIRTY GLASSES AND THE BISCUIT CRUMBS SEEM TO ME RATHER GRATUITOUS DECEPTIONS AND WAIT SAID QUARLES YOU ASSUME A LITTLE TOO MUCH THEY WOULD HAVE DECEIVED NINE MEN OUT OF TEN YOU HAPPEN TO BE THE TENTH MAN
7190-90543-0023 AMATEUR OR NOT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH A VERY SMART MAN SO DON'T UNDERESTIMATE THE ENEMY WIGAN ASSUMING THIS TO BE THE WORK OF AN AMATEUR TO WHAT DEFINITE POINT DOES IT LEAD YOU TO THIS QUESTION I REPLIED DID SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD BURGLE HIS OWN HOUSE
7190-90543-0024 WHY SHOULD YOU THINK SO HIS MANNER WAS CURIOUS THEN THERE IS ONLY HIS OWN STATEMENT THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN TAKEN BUT SUPPOSING HE WISHED TO GET RID OF PAPERS OR
7190-90543-0025 WOULD HE NOT HAVE ROBBED HIMSELF OF SOMETHING TO MAKE THE AFFAIR MORE PLAUSIBLE SAID QUARLES THE AMATEUR CONSTANTLY OVERLOOKS THE OBVIOUS I ANSWERED THE PROFESSOR SHOOK HIS HEAD
7190-90543-0026 I THINK THAT WOULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE MAN'S TEMPERAMENT PROFESSOR
7190-90543-0027 SIR JOSEPH'S STANDING IS VERY HIGH SUDDEN TEMPTATION OR NECESSITY MAY SUBVERT THE HIGHEST CHARACTER I ANSWERED
7190-90543-0028 WHEN I QUESTIONED SIR JOSEPH ABOUT HIS PAPERS HIS MANNER SEEMED CURIOUS AS I HAVE SAID HE AT ONCE DECLARED THAT HE HAD NO PART IN ANY GOVERNMENT SECRET OR MYSTERIOUS SOCIETY GRATUITOUS INFORMATION YOU UNDERSTAND
7190-90543-0029 NOT IN ANSWER TO ANY DIRECT QUESTION OF MINE SHOWING THAT THE IDEAS WERE IN HIS MIND WHY THE EXPLANATION WOULD BE SIMPLE IF HE WERE THE BURGLAR OF HIS OWN PAPERS
7190-90543-0030 I ADMIT THE ARGUMENT IS SOUND WIGAN BUT IT DOES NOT CREEP INTO MY BRAIN WITH ANY COMPELLING INFLUENCE THERE IS A LINK MISSING IN THE CHAIN SOMEWHERE AND HE LOOKED AT ZENA HIS OFTEN REPEATED STATEMENT THAT SHE HELPED HIM BY HER QUESTIONS HAD NEVER IMPRESSED ME VERY GREATLY
7190-90543-0031 WHEN A MYSTERY WAS CLEARED UP IT WAS EASY TO SAY THAT ZENA HAD PUT HIM ON THE RIGHT ROAD AND I CONSIDERED IT A WHIM OF HIS MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE
7190-90543-0032 IT WAS SO NOW YOU DO NOT SEEM INTERESTED IN THE BROKEN BOX OF COUNTERS SHE SAID TURNING TOWARD HER GRANDFATHER I WONDER WIGAN IS THAT THE CLEW QUARLES SAID QUICKLY IT CREEPS INTO MY BRAIN THE COUNTERS WERE IN A HEAP I SAID
7190-90543-0033 ASKED QUARLES NO THAT WOULD HAVE SCATTERED THEM MORE THEY WERE ROUND AND MIGHT HAVE FALLEN OVER AFTER HAVING BEEN PUT ONE UPON ANOTHER AS ONE GATHERS COPPERS TOGETHER WHEN COUNTING A NUMBER OF THEM SIR JOSEPH PICKED THEM UP
7190-90543-0034 DID THAT STRIKE YOU AS SIGNIFICANT ASKED QUARLES I CANNOT SAY IT DID
7190-90543-0035 THEY ARE SIGNIFICANT WIGAN BUT I CANNOT SEE YET IN WHICH DIRECTION THEY LEAD US WE MUST WAIT FOR THE MOMENT THERE IS NOTHING TO BE DONE I HAD BECOME SO ACCUSTOMED TO QUARLES JUMPING TO SOME SUDDEN CONCLUSION THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED
7190-90543-0036 NATURALLY I WAS NOT IDLE DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT AT THE END OF THEM I HAD LEARNT NOTHING THEN THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENED ON CONSECUTIVE NIGHTS TWO DOCTORS HOUSES WERE BURGLED THE FIRST WAS IN KENSINGTON
7190-90543-0037 RATHER THAN INTENDED ROBBERY NOTHING HAD BEEN STOLEN BUT EVERYTHING IN HIS ROOM WAS IN DISORDER AND A SMALL AND UNIQUE INLAID CABINET WITH A SECRET SPRING LOCK HAD BEEN SMASHED TO PIECES SEVERAL CIGARETTE ENDS WERE ON THE FLOOR
7190-90543-0038 HE HAD SEVERAL CABINETS IN HIS ROOM CONTAINING SPECIMENS AND EVERYTHING HAD BEEN TURNED ON TO THE FLOOR AND DAMAGED MORE OR LESS IN FACT ALTHOUGH NOTHING HAD BEEN TAKEN THE DAMAGE WAS CONSIDERABLE ON THE NIGHT OF THE BURGLARY DOCTOR WOOD WAS AWAY FROM HOME
7190-90543-0039 ONLY SERVANTS BEING IN THE HOUSE THE COOK SUFFERING FROM FACEACHE HAD BEEN RESTLESS ALL NIGHT BUT HAD HEARD NOTHING
7190-90543-0040 FOR A REVOLVER LOADED IN EVERY CHAMBER WAS FOUND ON ONE OF THE CABINETS APPARENTLY HAVING PUT IT READY FOR USE HE HAD FORGOTTEN TO TAKE IT AWAY THE DOCTOR WAS FURIOUS AT THE WANTON DESTRUCTION OF HIS SPECIMENS
7190-90543-0041 THE UNEXPECTED HAS HAPPENED I SAID NO NO THE EXPECTED
7190-90543-0042 I'VE READ EVERY REPORT BUT TELL ME YOURSELF EVERY DETAIL I DID SO THE SAME BRAND OF CIGARETTES HE ASKED NO BUT ALL CHEAP AMERICAN ONES
7190-90543-0043 YOU STILL THINK THAT NOTHING HAS HAPPENED
7190-90543-0044 NO I HOLD TO THE ONE MAN THEORY AND YOU ARE RIGHT HE SNAPPED I ADMIT I MIGHT NOT HAVE GOT UPON THE RIGHT TRACK HAD YOU NOT MADE THAT DISCOVERY IT WAS CLEVER WIGAN IT DID NOT SEEM TO HELP YOU TO A THEORY I ANSWERED TRUE
7190-90543-0045 MUCH DEPENDED UPON THE ANSWER IF HE HAD
7190-90543-0046 IF THE THIEF HAD NOT FOUND WHAT HE WANTED HE WOULD CONTINUE HIS SEARCH I ARGUED FOR SOME REASON HE CONNECTED SIR JOSEPH MAYNARD WITH THE OBJECT OF HIS SEARCH
7226-86964-0000 WE WERE SOMEWHAT JADED BY THE TIME MONDAY MORNING CAME FOR SUNDAY BROUGHT NOT ONLY NO RELIEF BUT REPETITIONS OF MANY OF THE MOST HORRIBLE OF THESE TALES OF A WAYSIDE INN
7226-86964-0001 IT WAS WITH NO SLIGHT SENSE OF RELIEF THAT WE PAID OUR MODEST BILL AND AT LAST BROKE AWAY FROM SUCH GHASTLY ASSOCIATIONS AN INVOLUNTARY SHUDDER OVERCAME ME AS WE PASSED THE HEAD OF THE ISLAND
7226-86964-0002 AT THE FOOT OF OUR HOST'S ORCHARD WHICH HE HAD DESCRIBED AS A CATCH BASIN FOR HUMAN FLOATERS OUR COURSE STILL LAY AMONG LARGE DENSELY WOODED ISLANDS MANY OF THEM WHOLLY GIVEN UP TO MAPLES AND WILLOWS
7226-86964-0003 AND DEEP CUTS THROUGH SUN BAKED MUDBANKS THE COLOR OF ADOBE BUT OCCASIONALLY THERE ARE LOW GLOOMY BOTTOMS HEAVILY FORESTED AND STREWN WITH FLOOD WOOD WHILE BEYOND THE LAND RISES GRADUALLY INTO PRAIRIE STRETCHES
7226-86964-0004 IN THE BOTTOMS THE TREES ARE FILLED WITH FLOCKS OF BIRDS CROWS HAWKS BLACKBIRDS WITH STATELY BLUE HERONS AND AGILE PLOVERS FORAGING ON THE LONG GRAVEL SPITS WHICH FREQUENTLY JUT FAR INTO THE STREAM
7226-86964-0005 DUCKS ARE FREQUENTLY SEEN SAILING NEAR THE SHORES WHILE DIVERS SILENTLY DART AND PLUNGE AHEAD OF THE CANOE SAFELY OUT OF GUNSHOT REACH A HEAD WIND THIS MORNING MADE ROWING MORE DIFFICULT BY COUNTERACTING THE INFLUENCE OF THE CURRENT
7226-86964-0006 WE WERE AT LYNDON AT ELEVEN O'CLOCK THERE IS A POPULATION OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED CLUSTERED AROUND A RED PAPER MILL THE LATTER MADE A PRETTY PICTURE STANDING OUT ON THE BOLD BANK BACKED BY A NUMBER OF HUGE STACKS OF GOLDEN STRAW
7226-86964-0007 WE MET HERE THE FIRST RAPIDS WORTHY OF RECORD ALSO AN OLD ABANDONED MILL DAM IN THE LAST STAGES OF DECAY STRETCHING ITS WHITENED SKELETON ACROSS THE STREAM A HARBOR FOR DRIFTWOOD
7226-86964-0008 NEAR THE SOUTH BANK THE FRAMEWORK HAS BEEN ENTIRELY SWEPT AWAY FOR A SPACE SEVERAL RODS IN WIDTH AND THROUGH THIS OPENING THE PENT UP CURRENT FIERCELY SWEEPS WE WENT THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE CHANNEL THUS MADE WITH A SWOOP
7226-86964-0009 THAT GAVE US AN IMPETUS WHICH SOON CARRIED OUR VESSEL OUT OF SIGHT OF LYNDON AND ITS PAPER MILL AND STRAW STACKS PROPHETSTOWN FIVE MILES BELOW IS PRETTILY SITUATED IN AN OAK GROVE ON THE SOUTHERN BANK
7226-86964-0010 ONLY THE GABLES OF A FEW HOUSES CAN BE SEEN FROM THE RIVER WHOSE BANKS OF YELLOW CLAY AND BROWN MUD ARE HERE TWENTY FIVE FEET HIGH DURING THE FIRST THIRD OF THE PRESENT CENTURY THIS PLACE WAS THE SITE OF A WINNEBAGO VILLAGE WHOSE CHIEF
7226-86964-0011 WAS WHITE CLOUD A SHREWD SINISTER SAVAGE HALF WINNEBAGO AND HALF SAC WHO CLAIMED TO BE A PROPHET HE WAS BLACK HAWK'S EVIL GENIUS DURING THE UPRISING OF EIGHTEEN THIRTY TWO AND IN MANY WAYS
7226-86964-0012 WAS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE ABORIGINES KNOWN TO ILLINOIS HISTORY IT WAS AT THE PROPHET'S TOWN AS WHITE CLOUD'S VILLAGE WAS KNOWN IN PIONEER DAYS THAT BLACK HAWK RESTED UPON HIS ILL FATED JOURNEY UP THE ROCK AND FROM HERE
7226-86964-0013 AT THE INSTIGATION OF THE WIZARD HE BADE THE UNITED STATES SOLDIERY DEFIANCE THERE ARE RAPIDS ALMOST CONTINUALLY FROM A MILE ABOVE PROPHETSTOWN TO ERIE TEN MILES BELOW THE RIVER BED HERE HAS A SHARPER DESCENT THAN CUSTOMARY
7226-86964-0014 AND IS THICKLY STREWN WITH BOWLDERS MANY OF THEM WERE VISIBLE ABOVE THE SURFACE AT THE LOW STAGE OF WATER WHICH WE FOUND BUT FOR THE GREATER PART THEY WERE COVERED FOR TWO OR THREE INCHES WHAT WITH THESE IMPEDIMENTS
7226-86964-0015 THE SNAGS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT AS THE LEGACY OF LAST SPRING'S FLOOD AND THE FREQUENT SAND BANKS AND GRAVEL SPITS NAVIGATION WAS ATTENDED BY MANY DIFFICULTIES AND SOME DANGERS FOUR OR FIVE MILES BELOW PROPHETSTOWN
7226-86964-0016 A LONE FISHERMAN ENGAGED IN EXAMINING A TRAUT LINE STRETCHED BETWEEN ONE OF THE NUMEROUS GLOOMY ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND KINDLY INFORMED US OF A MILE LONG CUT OFF THE MOUTH OF WHICH WAS NOW IN VIEW THAT WOULD SAVE US SEVERAL MILES OF ROWING
7226-86964-0017 HERE THE HIGH BANKS HAD RECEDED WITH SEVERAL MILES OF HEAVILY WOODED BOGGY BOTTOMS INTERVENING FLOODS HAD HELD HIGH CARNIVAL AND THE ASPECT OF THE COUNTRY WAS WILD AND DESERTED THE CUT OFF WAS AN UGLY LOOKING CHANNEL
7226-86964-0018 BUT WHERE OUR INFORMANT HAD GONE THROUGH WITH HIS UNWIELDY HULK WE CONSIDERED IT SAFE TO VENTURE WITH A CANOE SO READILY RESPONSIVE TO THE SLIGHTEST PADDLE STROKE
7226-86964-0019 IT WAS A SCENE OF HOWLING DESOLATION RACK AND RUIN UPON EVERY HAND THE MUDDY TORRENT AT A VELOCITY OF FULLY EIGHT MILES AN HOUR WENT EDDYING AND WHIRLING AND DARTING AND ROARING AMONG THE GNARLED AND BLACKENED STUMPS THE PROSTRATE TREES
7226-86964-0020 THE TWISTED ROOTS THE HUGE BOWLDERS WHICH STUDDED ITS COURSE THE STREAM WAS NOT WIDE ENOUGH FOR THE OARS THE PADDLE WAS THE SOLE RELIANCE WITH EYES STRAINED FOR OBSTRUCTIONS WE TURNED AND TWISTED THROUGH THE LABYRINTH
7226-86964-0021 JUMPING ALONG AT A BREAKNECK SPEED AND WHEN WE FINALLY REJOINED THE MAIN RIVER BELOW WERE GRATEFUL ENOUGH FOR THE RUN HAD BEEN FILLED WITH CONTINUOUS POSSIBILITIES OF A DISASTROUS SMASH UP MILES AWAY FROM ANY HUMAN HABITATION
7226-86964-0022 THE THUNDER STORM WHICH HAD BEEN THREATENING SINCE EARLY MORNING SOON BURST UPON US WITH A PRELIMINARY WIND BLAST FOLLOWED BY DRENCHING RAIN RUNNING ASHORE ON THE LEE BANK WE WRAPPED THE CANVAS AWNING AROUND THE BAGGAGE
7226-86964-0023 AND MADE FOR A THICK CLUMP OF TREES ON THE TOP OF AN ISLAND MUDBANK WHERE WE STOOD BUTTONED TO THE NECK IN RUBBER COATS A VIGOROUS HALLOO CAME SOUNDING OVER THE WATER LOOKING UP WE SAW FOR THE FIRST TIME A SMALL TENT ON THE OPPOSITE SHORE
7226-86964-0024 A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY IN FRONT OF WHICH WAS A MAN SHOUTING TO US AND BECKONING US OVER IT WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY MUDDY UNDER THE TREES WHICH HAD NOT LONG SUFFICED AS AN UMBRELLA AND THE RUBBER COATS WERE NOT WARRANTED TO WITHSTAND A DELUGE
7226-86964-0025 SO WE ACCEPTED THE INVITATION WITH ALACRITY AND PADDLED OVER THROUGH THE PELTING STORM OUR HOST WAS A YOUNG FISHERMAN WHO HELPED US AND OUR LUGGAGE UP THE SLIMY BANK TO HIS CANVAS QUARTERS WHICH WE FOUND TO BE DRY ALTHOUGH ODOROUS OF FISH
7226-86964-0026 WHILE THE STORM RAGED WITHOUT THE YOUNG MAN WHO WAS A SIMPLE HEARTED FELLOW CONFIDED TO US THE DETAILS OF HIS BRIEF CAREER HE HAD BEEN MARRIED BUT A YEAR HE SAID HIS LITTLE CABIN LAY A QUARTER OF A MILE BACK IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0027 AND SO AS TO BE CONVENIENT TO HIS LINES HE WAS CAMPING ON HIS OWN WOOD LOT THE GREATER PART OF HIS TIME WAS SPENT IN FISHING OR HUNTING ACCORDING TO THE SEASON AND PEDDLING THE PRODUCT IN NEIGHBORING TOWNS
7226-86964-0028 WHICH HAD RECENTLY BECOME ENRICHED BY THE ADDITION OF AN INFANT SON THE PHENOMENAL POWERS OF OBSERVATION DISPLAYED BY THIS FIRST BORN YOUTH WERE REPORTED WITH MUCH DETAIL BY THE FOND FATHER WHO SAT CROUCHED UPON A BOAT SAIL IN ONE CORNER OF THE LITTLE TENT
7226-86964-0029 HIS HEAD BETWEEN HIS KNEES AND SMOKING VILE TOBACCO IN A BLACKENED CLAY PIPE IT SEEMED THAT HIS WIFE WAS A FERRYMAN'S DAUGHTER AND HER FATHER HAD BESOUGHT HIS SON IN LAW TO FOLLOW THE SAME STEADY CALLING TO BE SURE OUR HOST DECLARED FERRIES ON THE ROCK RIVER NETTED THEIR OWNERS
7226-86964-0030 WHICH HE CONSIDERED A GOODLY SUM AND HIS FATHER IN LAW HAD OFFERED TO PURCHASE AN ESTABLISHED PLANT FOR HIM BUT THE YOUNG FELLOW SAID THAT FERRYING WAS A DOG'S LIFE AND KEPT A FELLER HOME LIKE BARN CHORES
7226-86964-0031 SO REJECTED THE OFFER AND SETTLED DOWN AVOWEDLY FOR LIFE IN HIS PRESENT PRECARIOUS OCCUPATION AS A RESULT THE INDIGNANT OLD MAN HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO AGAIN ENTER THE PARENTAL FERRY HOUSE UNTIL HE AGREED TO ACCEPT HIS PROPOSALS
7226-86964-0032 AND THERE WAS HENCEFORTH TO BE A STANDING FAMILY QUARREL THE FISHERMAN HAVING APPEALED TO MY JUDGMENT I ENDEAVORED WITH MILD CAUTION TO ARGUE HIM OUT OF HIS POSITION ON THE SCORE OF CONSIDERATION FOR HIS WIFE AND LITTLE ONE
7226-86964-0033 AND FIRMLY THOUGH WITH ADMIRABLE GOOD NATURE PERSISTED IN DEFENDING HIS ROVING TENDENCIES IN THE COURSE OF OUR CONVERSATION I LEARNED THAT THE FERRYMEN WHO ARE MORE NUMEROUS ON THE LOWER THAN ON THE UPPER ROCK PAY AN ANNUAL LICENSE FEE OF FIVE DOLLARS EACH
7226-86964-0034 IN CONSIDERATION OF WHICH THEY ARE GUARANTIED A MONOPOLY OF THE BUSINESS AT THEIR STANDS NO OTHER LINE BEING ALLOWED WITHIN ONE MILE OF AN EXISTING FERRY WITHIN AN HOUR AND A HALF THE STORM HAD APPARENTLY PASSED OVER AND WE CONTINUED OUR JOURNEY
7226-86964-0035 BUT AFTER SUPPER ANOTHER SHOWER AND A STIFF HEAD WIND CAME UP AND WE WERE WELL BEDRAGGLED BY THE TIME A FERRY LANDING NEAR THE LITTLE VILLAGE OF ERIE WAS REACHED THE BOTTOMS ARE HERE A MILE OR TWO IN WIDTH WITH OCCASIONAL OPENINGS IN THE WOODS
7226-86964-0036 WHERE SMALL FIELDS ARE CULTIVATED BY THE POORER CLASS OF FARMERS WHO WERE LAST SPRING MUCH DAMAGED BY THE FLOOD WHICH SWEPT THIS ENTIRE COUNTRY THE FERRYMAN A GOOD NATURED YOUNG ATHLETE
7226-86964-0037 WAS LANDING A FARM WAGON AND TEAM AS WE PULLED IN UPON THE MUDDY ROADWAY WHEN QUESTIONED ABOUT QUARTERS HE SMILED AND POINTING TO HIS LITTLE CABIN A FEW RODS OFF IN THE BUSHES SAID WE'VE FOUR PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN TWO ROOMS
7226-86964-0038 IT'S SURE WE CAN'T TAKE YE I'D LIKE TO OTHERWISE BUT ERIE'S ONLY A MILE AWAY WE ASSURED HIM THAT WITH THESE MUDDY SWAMP ROADS AND IN OUR WET CONDITION NOTHING BUT ABSOLUTE NECESSITY WOULD INDUCE US TO TAKE A MILE'S TRAMP THE PARLEY
7226-86964-0039 ENDED IN OUR BEING DIRECTED TO A SMALL FARM HOUSE A QUARTER OF A MILE INLAND WHERE LUCKLESS TRAVELERS BELATED ON THE DREARY BOTTOMS WERE OCCASIONALLY KEPT MAKING THE CANOE FAST FOR THE NIGHT WE STRUNG OUR BAGGAGE PACKS UPON THE PADDLE WHICH WE CARRIED BETWEEN US
7226-86964-0040 AND SET OUT ALONG A DEVIOUS WAY THROUGH A DRIVING MIST WHICH BLACKENED THE TWILIGHT INTO DUSK TO FIND THIS PLACE OF PUBLIC ENTERTAINMENT IT IS A LITTLE ONE STORY DILAPIDATED FARM HOUSE
7226-86964-0041 STANDING A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE COUNTRY ROAD AMID A CLUMP OF POPLAR TREES FORCING OUR WAY THROUGH THE HINGELESS GATE THE VIOLENT REMOVAL OF WHICH THREATENED THE IMMEDIATE DESTRUCTION OF SEVERAL LENGTHS OF RICKETY FENCE
7226-86964-0042 WE WALKED UP TO THE OPEN FRONT DOOR AND APPLIED FOR SHELTER YES MA'AM WE SOMETIMES KEEPS TAVERN MA'AM REPLIED A LARGE GREASY LOOKING BLACK HAIRED WOMAN OF SOME FORTY YEARS
7226-86964-0043 AS HER HANDS FOLDED WITHIN HER UP TURNED APRON SHE COURTESIED TO W WE WERE AT ONCE SHOWN INTO A FROWSY APARTMENT WHICH SERVED AS PARLOR SITTING ROOM AND PARENTAL DORMITORY
7226-86964-0044 AND CHEAP DECORATIONS PECULIAR IN THE COUNTRY TO ALL THREE CLASSES OF ROOMS THE EVIDENCES OF POVERTY SHIFTLESSNESS AND UNTASTEFUL PRETENTIOUSNESS UPON EVERY SIDE
7226-86964-0045 A HUGE WHEEZY OLD CABINET ORGAN WAS SET DIAGONALLY IN ONE CORNER AND UPON THIS AS WE ENTERED A YOUNG WOMAN WAS POUNDING AND PADDLING WITH MUCH VIGOR WHILE GIVING US SIDELONG GLANCES OF CURIOSITY
7226-86964-0046 SHE WAS A NEIGHBOR ON AN EVENING VISIT DECKED OUT IN A SMART JOCKEY CAP WITH A GREEN OSTRICH TIP AND BRIGHT BLUE RIBBONS AND GAY IN A NEW CALICO DRESS
7226-86964-0047 A YELLOW FIELD THICKLY PLANTED TO PURPLE PINEAPPLES A JAUNTY FORWARD CREATURE IN PIMPLES AND CURLS SHE RATTLED AWAY THROUGH A MOODY AND SANKEY HYMN BOOK THE WHEEZES AND GROANS OF THE ANTIQUE INSTRUMENT
7226-86964-0048 COMING IN LIKE MOURNFUL EJACULATIONS FROM THE AMEN CORNER AT A SUCCESSFUL REVIVAL HAVING EXHAUSTED HER STOCK OF TUNES SHE WHEELED AROUND UPON HER STOOL AND AFTER DECLARING TO HER HALF DOZEN ADMIRING AUDITORS THAT HER HANDS
7226-86964-0049 WERE AS TIRED AS AFTER THE MORNIN'S MILKIN ABRUPTLY ACCOSTED W MA'AM KIN YE PLAY ON THE ORGIN W CONFESSED HER INABILITY CHIEFLY FROM LACK OF PRACTICE IN THE ART OF INCESSANTLY WORKING THE PEDALS
7226-86964-0050 THAT'S THE TRICK O THE HUL BUSINESS MA'AM IS THE BLOWIN IT'S ALL IN GETTIN THE BELLERS TO WORK EVEN LIKE THERE'S A GOOD MANY WHAT KIN LEARN THE PLAYIN PART OF IT WITHOUT NO TEACHER BUT THERE HAS TO BE LESSONS TO LEARN THE BELLERS
7226-86964-0051 W MODESTLY CONFESSED TO NEVER HAVING POSSESSED SUCH AN INSTRUMENT DOWN IN THESE PARTS REJOINED THE YOUNG WOMAN AS SHE WORKED THE BELLERS INTO A STRAIN OR TWO OF HOLD THE FORT APPARENTLY TO SHOW HOW EASY IT CAME TO TRAINED FEET
7226-86964-0052 NO HOUSE IS NOW CONSIDERED QUITE UP TO THE FASHI'N AS AIN'T GOT A ORGIN THE RAIN BEING NOW OVER SHE SOON DEPARTED
7226-86964-0053 THE BED CHAMBER INTO WHICH WE WERE SHOWN WAS A MARVEL IT OPENED OFF THE MAIN ROOM AND WAS DOUBTLESS ORIGINALLY A CUPBOARD SEVEN FEET SQUARE WITH A BROAD ROPED BEDSTEAD OCCUPYING THE ENTIRE LENGTH
7226-86964-0054 NECESSITATING THE USE OF THE BED AS A DRESSING PLACE AFTER THE FASHION OF A SLEEPING CAR BUNK THIS CUBBY HOLE OF A ROOM WAS ALSO THE WARDROBE FOR THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD THE WALLS ABOVE THE BED BEING HUNG NEARLY TWO FEET DEEP
7226-86964-0055 WITH THE ODDEST COLLECTION OF CALICO AND GINGHAM GOWNS BUSTLES HOOPSKIRTS HATS BONNETS AND WINTER UNDERWEAR I THINK I HAD EVER LAID EYES ON MUCH OF THIS CONDITION OF AFFAIRS WAS NOT KNOWN HOWEVER UNTIL NEXT MORNING
7226-86964-0056 FOR IT WAS AS DARK AS EGYPT WITHIN EXCEPT FOR A FEW FAINT RAYS OF LIGHT WHICH CAME STRAGGLING THROUGH THE CRACKS IN THE BOARD PARTITION SEPARATING US FROM THE SITTING ROOM CANDLE WE HAD NO SOONER CROSSED THE THRESHOLD OF OUR LITTLE BOX
7226-86964-0057 THAN THE CREAKY OLD CLEAT DOOR WAS GENTLY CLOSED UPON US AND BUTTONED BY OUR HOSTESS UPON THE OUTSIDE AS THE ONLY MEANS OF KEEPING IT SHUT AND WE WERE LEFT FREE TO GROPE ABOUT AMONG THESE MYSTERIES AS BEST WE MIGHT
7226-86964-0058 WE HAD HARDLY RECOVERED FROM OUR ASTONISHMENT AT THUS BEING LOCKED INTO A DARK HOLE THE SIZE OF A FASHIONABLE LADY'S TRUNK AND WERE QUIETLY LAUGHING OVER THIS ODD ADVENTURE WHEN THE LANDLADY APPLIED HER MOUTH TO A CRACK AND SHOUTED AS IF SHE WOULD HAVE WAKED THE DEAD HI THERE
7226-86964-0059 A FEW MINUTES LATER RETURNING TO THE CRACK SHE ADDED
7226-86964-0060 REPRESSING OUR MIRTH WE ASSURED OUR GOOD HOSTESS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A DUE REGARD FOR OUR PERSONAL SAFETY
7226-86965-0000 WE HAD BREAKFAST IN THE TAVERN KITCHEN
7226-86965-0001 WAS A SHORT SMOOTH FACED VOLUBLE OVERGROWN BOY SORT OF MAN THE MOTHER WAS DUMPY COARSE AND GOOD NATURED THEY HAD A GREASY EASY TEMPERED DAUGHTER OF EIGHTEEN WITH A FROWSY HEAD AND A FACE LIKE A FULL MOON
7226-86965-0002 WHILE THE HEIR OF THE HOUSEHOLD SOMEWHAT YOUNGER WAS A GAPING GRINNING YOUTH OF THE SIMPLE SIMON ORDER WHO SHOVELLED MASHED POTATOES INTO HIS MOUTH ALTERNATELY WITH KNIFE AND FORK AND TOOK BITES OF BREAD LARGE ENOUGH FOR A RAVENOUS DOG
7226-86965-0003 THE OLD GRANDMOTHER WITH A FACE LIKE PARCHMENT AND ONE GLEAMING EYE SAT IN A LOW ROCKING CHAIR BY THE STOVE CROONING OVER A CORN COB PIPE AND USING THE WOOD BOX FOR A CUSPADORE SHE HAD A VINEGARY SLANGY TONGUE
7226-86965-0004 AND BEING SOMEWHAT DEAF WOULD BREAK IN UPON THE CONVERSATION WITH REMARKS SHARPER THAN THEY WERE PAT WITH OUR HOST A GLIB AND RAPID TALKER IN A SWAGGERING TONE ONE COULD NOT BUT BE MUCH AMUSED
7226-86965-0005 AS HE EXHIBITED A DEGREE OF SELF APPRECIATION THAT WAS DECIDEDLY REFRESHING HE HAD BEEN A VETERAN IN THE WAR OF THE REBELLION HE PROUDLY ASSURED US AND POINTED WITH HIS KNIFE TO HIS DISCHARGE PAPER WHICH WAS HUNG UP IN AN OLD LOOKING GLASS FRAME
7226-86965-0006 BY THE SIDE OF THE CLOCK GEMMEN HE INVARIABLY THUS ADDRESSED US AS THOUGH WE WERE A COTERIE OF CHECKER PLAYERS AT A VILLAGE GROCERY GEMMEN WHEN I SEEN HOW THEM JOHNNY REBS WAS A USIN OUR BOYS IN THEM PRISON PENS
7226-86965-0007 JOE MY BOY YOU GO NOW AN DO SOME'N FER YER COUNTRY A CRACK SHOT LIKE YOU IS JOE SAYS I TO MYSELF AS KIN HIT A DUCK ON THE WING EVERY TIME AN NO MISTAKE
7226-86965-0008 AN SO I JINED AN I STUCK HER OUT GEMMEN TILL THE THING WAS DONE THEY AIN'T NO COWARD BOUT ME
7226-86965-0009 NOW HE SAYS HOLD ON A MINUTE YOU DIDN'T HEV SHAKES AFORE THE WAR SAYS HE NOT AS MUCH I SAYS NOT KNOWIN WHAT THE FELLER WAS DRIVIN AT BUT SOME I WAS A KID THEN AND KIDS DON'T SHAKE MUCH SAYS I

7226-86965-0014 THERE WAS HEAPS O BLOOD SPILT UNNECESSARY BY US BOYS A FIGHTIN TO SAVE THE OL FLAG
7226-86965-0015 I SAID TO OUR LANDLORD BY WAY OF HELPING ALONG THE CONVERSATION THERE WAS A MOMENTARY SILENCE BROKEN BY SIMPLE SIMON WHO WIPED HIS KNIFE ON HIS TONGUE AND MADE A WILD ATTACK ON THE BUTTER DISH PA HE DRUV A MULE TEAM FOR GOV'MENT
7226-86965-0016 WITH A BIG AMMERNITION WAGIN ON BEHIND
7226-86965-0017 THIS SUDDEN REVELATION OF THE STRENGTH OF THE VETERAN'S CLAIM TO GLORY AND A PENSION PUT A DAMPER UPON HIS REMINISCENCES OF THE WAR AND GIVING THE INNOCENT SIMON A SAVAGE LEER
7226-86965-0018 HE SOON CONTRIVED TO TURN THE CONVERSATION UPON HIS WONDERFUL EXPLOITS IN DUCK SHOOTING AND FISHING INDUSTRIES IN THE PURSUIT OF WHICH HE WITH SO MANY OF HIS FELLOW FARMERS ON THE BOTTOMS APPEARED TO BE MORE EAGER THAN IN TILLING THE SOIL
7226-86965-0019 IT WAS QUITE EVIDENT THAT THE BREAKFAST WE WERE EATING WAS A SPECIAL SPREAD IN HONOR OF PROBABLY THE ONLY GUESTS THE QUONDAM TAVERN HAD HAD THESE MANY MONTHS CANOEISTS MUST NOT BE TOO PARTICULAR ABOUT THE FARE SET BEFORE THEM BUT ON THIS OCCASION
7226-86965-0020 WE WERE ABLE TO SWALLOW BUT A FEW MOUTHFULS OF THE REPAST AND OUR LUNCH BASKET WAS DRAWN ON AS SOON AS WE WERE ONCE MORE AFLOAT IT IS A GREAT PITY THAT SO MANY FARMERS WIVES ARE THE WRETCHED COOKS THEY ARE
7226-86965-0021 WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF GOOD MATERIALS ALREADY ABOUT THEM AND RARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR READILY ACQUIRING MORE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF RURAL DAMES DO MANAGE TO PREPARE ASTONISHINGLY INEDIBLE MEALS
7226-86965-0022 SOUR DOUGHY BREAD POTATOES WHICH IF BOILED ARE BUT HALF COOKED AND IF MASHED ARE FLOATED WITH ABOMINABLE BUTTER OR PASTEY FLOUR GRAVY SALT PORK EITHER SWIMMING IN A BOWL OF GREASE OR FRIED TO A LEATHERY CHIP
7226-86965-0023 TEA AND COFFEE EXTREMELY WEAK OR STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL AN OX AS CHANCE MAY DICTATE AND INEVITABLY ADULTERATED BEYOND RECOGNITION
7226-86965-0024 EGGS THAT ARE SPOILED BY BEING FRIED TO THE CONSISTENCY OF RUBBER IN A PAN OF FAT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT DOUGHNUTS WHILE THE BISCUITS ARE YELLOW AND BITTER WITH SALERATUS THIS BILL OF FARE WARRANTED TO DESTROY THE BEST OF APPETITES
7226-86965-0025 WILL BE RECOGNIZED BY TOO MANY OF MY READERS AS THAT TO BE FOUND AT THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FARM HOUSE ALTHOUGH WE ALL DOUBTLESS KNOW OF SOME MAGNIFICENT EXCEPTIONS WHICH ONLY PROVE THE RULE WE ESTABLISH PUBLIC COOKING SCHOOLS IN OUR CITIES
7226-86965-0026 AND ECONOMISTS LIKE EDWARD ATKINSON AND HYGIENISTS LIKE THE LATE DIO LEWIS ASSIDUOUSLY EXPLAIN TO THE METROPOLITAN POOR THEIR PROCESSES OF MAKING A TEMPTING MEAL OUT OF NOTHING
7226-86965-0027 BUT OUR MOST CRYING NEED IN THIS COUNTRY TO DAY IS A TRAINING SCHOOL FOR RURAL HOUSEWIVES WHERE THEY MAY BE TAUGHT TO EVOLVE A RESPECTABLE AND ECONOMICAL SPREAD OUT OF THE GREAT ABUNDANCE WITH WHICH THEY ARE SURROUNDED
7226-86965-0028 IT IS NO WONDER THAT COUNTRY BOYS DRIFT TO THE CITIES WHERE THEY CAN OBTAIN PROPERLY COOKED FOOD AND LIVE LIKE RATIONAL BEINGS THE RIVER CONTINUES TO WIDEN AS WE APPROACH THE JUNCTION WITH THE MISSISSIPPI THIRTY NINE MILES BELOW ERIE
7226-86965-0029 AND TO ASSUME THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GREAT RIVER INTO WHICH IT POURS ITS FLOOD THE ISLANDS INCREASE IN NUMBER AND IN SIZE SOME OF THEM BEING OVER A MILE IN LENGTH BY A QUARTER OF A MILE IN BREADTH
7226-86965-0030 THE BOTTOMS FREQUENTLY RESOLVE THEMSELVES INTO WIDE MORASSES THICKLY STUDDED WITH GREAT ELMS MAPLES AND COTTON WOODS AMONG WHICH THE SPRING FLOOD HAS WROUGHT DIREFUL DESTRUCTION THE SCENE BECOMES PECULIARLY DESOLATE
7226-86965-0031 AND MOURNFUL OFTEN GIVING ONE THE IMPRESSION OF BEING FAR REMOVED FROM CIVILIZATION THREADING THE COURSE OF SOME HITHERTO UNEXPLORED STREAM PENETRATE THE DEEP FRINGE OF FOREST AND MORASS ON FOOT HOWEVER AND SMILING PRAIRIES ARE FOUND BEYOND
7226-86965-0032 OF BEING EITHER GROUNDED OR CAPSIZED NOW AND THEN THE BANKS BECOME FIRMER WITH CHARMING VISTAS OF HIGH WOODED HILLS COMING DOWN TO THE WATER'S EDGE BROAD SAVANNAS INTERVENE DECKED OUT WITH VARIEGATED FLORA
7226-86965-0033 THE SPIDER WORT THE LITTLE BLUE LOBELIA AND THE CUP WEED THESE SAVANNAS ARE APPARENTLY OVERFLOWED IN TIMES OF EXCEPTIONALLY HIGH WATER
7226-86965-0034 AND THERE ARE EVIDENCES THAT THE STREAM HAS OCCASIONALLY CHANGED ITS COURSE THROUGH THE SUNBAKED BANKS OF ASHY GRAY MUD IN YEARS LONG PAST AT CLEVELAND A STAID LITTLE VILLAGE ON AN OPEN PLAIN WHICH WE REACHED SOON AFTER THE DINNER HOUR
7226-86965-0035 THERE IS AN UNUSED MILL DAM GOING TO DECAY IN THE CENTRE THE MAIN CURRENT HAS WASHED OUT A BREADTH OF THREE OR FOUR RODS THROUGH WHICH THE PENT UP STREAM RUSHES WITH A ROAR AND A HUNDRED WHIRLPOOLS IT IS AN UGLY CREVASSE
7226-86965-0036 BUT A CAREFUL EXAMINATION SHOWED THE PASSAGE TO BE FEASIBLE SO WE RETREATED AN EIGHTH OF A MILE UP STREAM TOOK OUR BEARINGS AND WENT THROUGH WITH A SPEED THAT NEARLY TOOK OUR BREATH AWAY AND APPEARED TO GREATLY ASTONISH A HALF DOZEN FISHERMEN
7226-86965-0037 IDLY ANGLING FROM THE DILAPIDATED APRON ON EITHER SIDE IT WAS LIKE GOING THROUGH CLEVELAND ON THE FAST MAIL FOURTEEN MILES ABOVE THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK IS THE CHICAGO BURLINGTON AND QUINCY RAILROAD BRIDGE WITH CARBON CLIFF ON THE NORTH
7226-86965-0038 AND COLOMA ON THE SOUTH EACH ONE MILE FROM THE RIVER THE DAY HAD BEEN DARK WITH OCCASIONAL SLIGHT SHOWERS AND A STIFF HEAD WIND SO THAT PROGRESS HAD BEEN SLOW WE BEGAN TO DEEM IT WORTH WHILE TO INQUIRE ABOUT THE CONDITION OF AFFAIRS AT THE MOUTH
7226-86965-0039 STOPPING TO QUESTION THEM WE FOUND THEM BOTH WELL INFORMED AS TO THE RAILWAY TIME TABLES OF THE VICINITY AND THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE LOWER RIVER THEY TOLD US THAT THE SCENERY FOR THE NEXT FOURTEEN MILES WAS SIMILAR IN ITS DARK DESOLATION TO THAT WHICH WE HAD PASSED THROUGH DURING THE DAY
7226-86965-0040 ALSO THAT OWING TO THE GREAT NUMBER OF ISLANDS AND THE LABYRINTH OF CHANNELS BOTH IN THE ROCK AND ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI WE SHOULD FIND IT PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHEN WE HAD REACHED THE LATTER WE SHOULD DOUBTLESS PROCEED SEVERAL MILES BELOW THE MOUTH OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0041 BEFORE WE NOTICED THAT THE CURRENT WAS SETTING PERSISTENTLY SOUTH AND THEN WOULD HAVE AN EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TASK IN RETRACING OUR COURSE AND PULLING UP STREAM TO OUR DESTINATION ROCK ISLAND WHICH IS SIX MILES NORTH OF THE DELTA OF THE ROCK
7226-86965-0042 THEY STRONGLY ADVISED OUR GOING INTO ROCK ISLAND BY RAIL THE PRESENT LANDING WAS THE LAST CHANCE TO STRIKE A RAILWAY EXCEPT AT MILAN TWELVE MILES BELOW IT WAS NOW SO LATE THAT WE COULD NOT HOPE TO REACH MILAN BEFORE DARK
7226-86965-0043 AND MILAN WAS FARTHER FROM ROCK ISLAND THAN EITHER CARBON CLIFF OR COLOMA WITH LESS FREQUENT RAILWAY SERVICE FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE DECIDED TO ACCEPT THIS ADVICE AND TO SHIP FROM COLOMA
7226-86965-0044 TAKING A FINAL SPURT DOWN TO A FERRY LANDING A QUARTER OF A MILE BEYOND ON THE SOUTH BANK
7226-86965-0045 HAVING VOYAGED TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN MILES IN SOMEWHAT LESS THAN SEVEN DAYS AND A HALF LEAVING W TO GOSSIP WITH THE FERRYMAN'S WIFE WHO CAME DOWN TO THE BANK WITH AN ARMFUL OF SMILING TWINS TO VIEW A CRAFT SO STRANGE TO HER VISION
7226-86965-0046 I WENT UP INTO THE COUNTRY TO ENGAGE A TEAM TO TAKE OUR BOAT UPON ITS LAST PORTAGE AFTER HAVING BEEN GRUFFLY REFUSED BY A CHURLISH FARMER WHO DOUBTLESS RECOGNIZED NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CANOEIST AND A TRAMP
7226-86965-0047 I STRUCK A BARGAIN WITH A NEGRO CULTIVATING A CORNFIELD WITH A SPAN OF COAL BLACK MULES AND IN HALF AN HOUR HE WAS AT THE FERRY LANDING WITH A WAGON WASHING OUT THE CANOE AND CHAINING IN THE OARS AND PADDLE WE LIFTED IT INTO THE WAGON BOX
7226-86965-0048 PILED OUR BAGGAGE ON TOP AND SET OFF OVER THE HILLS AND FIELDS TO COLOMA
7226-86965-0049 ANKLE DEEP IN MUD FOR THE LATE RAINS HAD WELL MOISTENED THE BLACK PRAIRIE SOIL IT WAS A UNIQUE AND PICTURESQUE PROCESSION
7264-92310-0000 LET US HALT AT THIS PHASE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE THING TO CONSIDER CERTAIN OTHER CHANGES WHICH WERE ON THE POINT OF APPEARANCE AND WHY THEY WERE ON THE POINT OF APPEARANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE IF ADVERTISEMENT HAD COME TO BE THE STAND BY OF A NEWSPAPER
7264-92310-0001 THE CAPITALIST OWNING THE SHEET WOULD NECESSARILY CONSIDER HIS REVENUE FROM ADVERTISEMENT BEFORE ANYTHING ELSE HE WAS INDEED COMPELLED TO DO SO UNLESS HE HAD ENORMOUS REVENUES FROM OTHER SOURCES AND RAN HIS PAPER AS A LUXURY COSTING A VAST FORTUNE A YEAR
7264-92310-0002 FOR IN THIS INDUSTRY THE RULE IS EITHER VERY GREAT PROFITS OR VERY GREAT AND RAPID LOSSES
7264-92310-0003 WHERE A GREAT DAILY PAPER IS CONCERNED HE WAS COMPELLED THEN TO RESPECT HIS ADVERTISERS AS HIS PAYMASTERS TO THAT EXTENT THEREFORE HIS POWER OF GIVING TRUE NEWS AND OF PRINTING SOUND OPINION WAS LIMITED EVEN THOUGH HIS OWN INCLINATIONS SHOULD LEAN TOWARDS SUCH NEWS AND SUCH OPINION
7264-92310-0004 AN INDIVIDUAL NEWSPAPER OWNER MIGHT FOR INSTANCE HAVE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DISLIKE FOR THE TRADE IN PATENT MEDICINES HE MIGHT OBJECT TO THE SWINDLING OF THE POOR WHICH IS THE SOUL OF THAT TRADE HE MIGHT HIMSELF HAVE SUFFERED ACUTE PHYSICAL PAIN
7264-92310-0005 BUT HE CERTAINLY COULD NOT PRINT AN ARTICLE AGAINST THEM NOR EVEN AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING HOW THEY WERE MADE WITHOUT LOSING A GREAT PART OF HIS INCOME DIRECTLY AND PERHAPS INDIRECTLY THE WHOLE OF IT FROM THE ANNOYANCE CAUSED TO OTHER ADVERTISERS WHO WOULD NOTE HIS INDEPENDENCE
7264-92310-0006 AND FEAR FRICTION IN THEIR OWN CASE HE WOULD PREFER TO RETAIN HIS INCOME PERSUADE HIS READERS TO BUY POISON AND REMAIN FREE PERSONALLY FROM TOUCHING THE STUFF HE RECOMMENDED FOR PAY
7264-92310-0007 THE PROPRIETOR WAS ALWAYS AT THE CHOICE OF PUBLISHING MATTER WHICH DID NOT AFFECT HIM AND SAVING HIS FORTUNE OR REFUSING IT AND JEOPARDIZING HIS FORTUNE HE CHOSE THE FORMER COURSE IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE WAS AN EVEN MORE SERIOUS DEVELOPMENT ADVERTISEMENT
7264-92310-0008 HAVING BECOME THE STAND BY OF THE NEWSPAPER THE LARGE ADVERTISER
7264-92310-0009 COULD NOT BUT REGARD HIS GIVING OF AN ADVERTISEMENT AS SOMETHING OF A FAVOUR THERE IS ALWAYS THIS PSYCHOLOGICAL OR IF YOU WILL ARTISTIC ELEMENT IN EXCHANGE IN PURE ECONOMICS EXCHANGE IS EXACTLY BALANCED BY THE RESPECTIVE ADVANTAGES OF THE EXCHANGERS
7264-92310-0010 JUST AS IN PURE DYNAMICS YOU HAVE THE PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES IN THE IMMENSE COMPLEXITY OF THE REAL WORLD MATERIAL FRICTION AND A MILLION OTHER THINGS AFFECT THE IDEAL PARALLELOGRAM OF FORCES AND IN ECONOMICS OTHER CONSCIOUS PASSIONS
7264-92310-0011 BESIDES THOSE OF MERE AVARICE AFFECT EXCHANGE THERE ARE A MILLION HALF CONSCIOUS AND SUB CONSCIOUS MOTIVES AT WORK AS WELL THE LARGE ADVERTISER STILL MAINLY PAID FOR ADVERTISEMENT ACCORDING TO CIRCULATION
7264-92310-0012 HE WOULD NOT ADVERTISE IN PAPERS WHICH HE THOUGHT MIGHT BY THEIR PUBLICATION OF OPINION ULTIMATELY HURT CAPITALISM AS A WHOLE STILL LESS IN THOSE WHOSE OPINIONS MIGHT AFFECT HIS OWN PRIVATE FORTUNE ADVERSELY STUPID LIKE ALL PEOPLE GIVEN UP TO GAIN
7264-92310-0013 HE WAS MUDDLE HEADED ABOUT THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN A LARGE CIRCULATION AND A CIRCULATION SMALL BUT APPEALING TO THE RICH HE WOULD REFUSE ADVERTISEMENTS OF LUXURIES TO A PAPER READ BY HALF THE WEALTHIER CLASS IF HE HAD HEARD IN THE NATIONAL LIBERAL CLUB
7264-92310-0014 OR SOME SUCH PLACE THAT THE PAPER WAS IN BAD TASTE NOT ONLY WAS THERE THIS NEGATIVE POWER IN THE HANDS OF THE ADVERTISER THAT OF REFUSING THE FAVOUR OR PATRONAGE OF HIS ADVERTISEMENTS THERE WAS ALSO A POSITIVE ONE THOUGH THAT ONLY GREW UP LATER
7264-92310-0015 THE ADVERTISER CAME TO SEE THAT HE COULD ACTUALLY DICTATE POLICY AND OPINION AND THAT HE HAD ALSO ANOTHER MOST POWERFUL AND NOVEL WEAPON IN HIS HAND WHICH WAS THE SUPPRESSION OF NEWS
7264-92310-0016 WE MUST NOT EXAGGERATE THIS ELEMENT FOR ONE THING THE POWER REPRESENTED BY THE GREAT CAPITALIST PRESS WAS A POWER EQUAL WITH THAT OF THE GREAT ADVERTISERS FOR ANOTHER THERE WAS NO CLEAR CUT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE CAPITALISM THAT OWNED NEWSPAPERS AND THE CAPITALISM THAT ADVERTISED
7264-92310-0017 THE SAME MAN WHO OWNED THE DAILY TIMES WAS A SHAREHOLDER IN JONES'S SOAP OR SMITH'S PILLS THE MAN WHO GAMBLED AND LOST ON THE HOWL WAS AT THE SAME TIME GAMBLING AND WINNING ON A BUCKET SHOP ADVERTISED IN THE HOWL
7264-92310-0018 THERE WAS NO ANTAGONISM OF CLASS INTEREST ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND WHAT WAS MORE THEY WERE OF THE SAME KIND AND BREED
7264-92310-0019 WAS EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF MAN AS HE WHO BOUGHT A PEERAGE OUT OF A COMBINE IN MUSIC HALLS OR CUT HIS THROAT WHEN HIS BLUFF IN INDIAN SILVER WAS CALLED THE TYPE IS THE COMMON MODERN TYPE PARLIAMENT IS FULL OF IT AND IT RUNS NEWSPAPERS ONLY AS ONE OF ITS ACTIVITIES
7264-92310-0020 ALL OF WHICH NEED THE SUGGESTION OF ADVERTISEMENT THE NEWSPAPER OWNER AND THE ADVERTISER THEN WERE INTERMIXED BUT ON THE BALANCE THE ADVERTISING INTEREST BEING WIDER SPREAD WAS THE STRONGER AND WHAT YOU GOT WAS A SORT OF IMPOSITION
7264-92310-0021 OFTEN QUITE CONSCIOUS AND DIRECT OF ADVERTISING POWER OVER THE PRESS AND THIS WAS AS I HAVE SAID NOT ONLY NEGATIVE THAT WAS LONG OBVIOUS BUT AT LAST POSITIVE
7264-92310-0022 BOTH COMBATANTS ARE OF A LOW CUNNING AND UNINTELLIGENT TYPE MINOR FRICTION DUE TO THE SAME CAUSE IS CONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE SOMETIMES THE VICTORY FALLS TO THE NEWSPAPER PROPRIETOR MORE OFTEN TO THE ADVERTISER NEVER TO THE PUBLIC
7264-92310-0023 SO FAR WE SEE THE GROWTH OF THE PRESS MARKED BY THESE CHARACTERISTICS ONE IT FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF A VERY FEW RICH MEN AND NEARLY ALWAYS OF MEN OF BASE ORIGIN AND CAPACITIES TWO IT IS IN THEIR HANDS A MERE COMMERCIAL ENTERPRISE
7264-92310-0024 THREE IT IS ECONOMICALLY SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISERS WHO CAN IN PART CONTROL IT BUT THESE ARE OF THE SAME CAPITALIST KIND IN MOTIVE AND MANNER WITH THE OWNERS OF THE PAPERS THEIR POWER DOES NOT THEREFORE CLASH IN THE MAIN WITH THAT OF THE OWNERS
7264-92310-0025 BUT THE FACT THAT ADVERTISEMENT MAKES A PAPER HAS CREATED A STANDARD OF PRINTING AND PAPER SUCH THAT NO ONE SAVE AT A DISASTROUS LOSS CAN ISSUE REGULARLY TO LARGE NUMBERS NEWS AND OPINION WHICH THE LARGE CAPITALIST ADVERTISERS DISAPPROVE
7264-92310-0026 THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE FOR ANY INDEPENDENT PRESS NO POSSIBLE ECONOMIC BASIS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC HAS BEEN TAUGHT TO EXPECT FOR
7264-92310-0027 THE DIFFERENCE BEING PAID BY THE ADVERTISEMENT SUBSIDY
7264-92310-0028 IT IS THE ADVENT OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNER AS THE TRUE GOVERNING POWER IN THE POLITICAL MACHINERY OF THE STATE SUPERIOR TO THE OFFICIALS IN THE STATE NOMINATING MINISTERS AND DISMISSING THEM IMPOSING POLICIES AND IN GENERAL USURPING SOVEREIGNTY
7264-92310-0029 ALL THIS SECRETLY AND WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY IT IS THE CHIEF POLITICAL EVENT OF OUR TIME AND IS THE PECULIAR MARK OF THIS COUNTRY TO DAY ITS FULL DEVELOPMENT HAS COME ON US SUDDENLY AND TAKEN US BY SURPRISE IN THE MIDST OF A TERRIBLE WAR
7264-92310-0030 IT WAS UNDREAMT OF BUT A FEW YEARS AGO IT IS ALREADY TO DAY THE CAPITAL FACT OF OUR WHOLE POLITICAL SYSTEM A PRIME MINISTER IS MADE OR DEPOSED BY THE OWNER OF A GROUP OF NEWSPAPERS NOT BY POPULAR VOTE OR BY ANY OTHER FORM OF OPEN AUTHORITY
7264-92310-0031 NO POLICY IS ATTEMPTED UNTIL IT IS ASCERTAINED THAT THE NEWSPAPER OWNER IS IN FAVOUR OF IT FEW ARE PROFFERED WITHOUT FIRST CONSULTING HIS WISHES MANY ARE DIRECTLY ORDERED BY HIM WE ARE IF WE TALK IN TERMS OF REAL THINGS AS MEN DO IN THEIR PRIVATE COUNCILS AT WESTMINSTER
7264-92310-0032 MAINLY GOVERNED TO DAY NOT EVEN BY THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS NOR EVEN BY THOSE WHO PAY THEM MONEY BUT BY WHATEVER OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER TRUST IS FOR THE MOMENT THE MOST UNSCRUPULOUS AND THE MOST AMBITIOUS
7264-92314-0000 I SAY THAT THE FEW NEWSPAPER CONTROLLERS GOVERN AND GOVERN ABOMINABLY I AM RIGHT BUT THEY ONLY DO SO AS DO ALL NEW POWERS BY AT ONCE ALLIANCE WITH AND TREASON AGAINST THE OLD WITNESS HARMSWORTH AND THE POLITICIANS
7264-92314-0001 THIS CONNECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CERTAIN CHARACTER WHICH CAN BE BEST DESCRIBED BY THE TERM OFFICIAL UNDER CERTAIN FORMS OF ARBITRARY GOVERNMENT IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE MINISTERS ONCE MADE USE OF PICKED
7264-92314-0002 AND RARE NEWSPAPERS TO EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND THESE NEWSPAPERS CAME TO BE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IT WAS A CRUDE METHOD AND HAS BEEN LONG ABANDONED EVEN BY THE SIMPLER DESPOTIC FORMS OF GOVERNMENT NOTHING OF THAT KIND EXISTS NOW OF COURSE IN THE DEEPER CORRUPTION OF MODERN EUROPE
7264-92314-0003 LEAST OF ALL IN ENGLAND WHAT HAS GROWN UP HERE IS A PRESS ORGANIZATION OF SUPPORT AND FAVOUR TO THE SYSTEM OF PROFESSIONAL POLITICS WHICH COLOURS THE WHOLE OF OUR GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS TO DAY IN ENGLAND THIS GIVES THEM SO DISTINCT A CHARACTER OF PARLIAMENTARY FALSEHOOD
7264-92314-0004 AND THAT FALSEHOOD IS SO CLEARLY DICTATED BY THEIR CONNECTION WITH EXECUTIVE POWER THAT THEY MERIT THE TITLE OFFICIAL THE REGIME UNDER WHICH WE ARE NOW LIVING IS THAT OF A PLUTOCRACY WHICH HAS GRADUALLY REPLACED THE OLD ARISTOCRATIC TRADITION OF ENGLAND
7264-92314-0005 THIS PLUTOCRACY A FEW WEALTHY INTERESTS IN PART CONTROLS IN PART IS EXPRESSED BY IS IN PART IDENTICAL WITH THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS AND IT HAS IN THE EXISTING CAPITALIST PRESS AN ALLY SIMILAR TO THAT OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92314-0006 WHICH CONTINENTAL NATIONS KNEW IN THE PAST BUT THERE IS THIS GREAT DIFFERENCE THAT THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CONTINENTAL EXPERIMENTS NEVER CONSISTED IN MORE THAN A FEW CHOSEN ORGANS
7264-92314-0007 THE CHARACTER OF WHICH WAS WELL KNOWN AND THE ATTITUDE OF WHICH CONTRASTED SHARPLY WITH THE REST BUT OUR OFFICIAL PRESS FOR IT IS NO LESS COVERS THE WHOLE FIELD IT HAS IN THE REGION OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPERS NO COMPETITOR INDEED IT HAS NO COMPETITORS AT ALL
7264-92314-0008 IF ANY ONE DOUBTS THAT THIS ADJECTIVE OFFICIAL CAN PROPERLY BE APPLIED TO OUR CAPITALIST PRESS TO DAY LET HIM ASK HIMSELF FIRST WHAT THE FORCES ARE WHICH GOVERN THE NATION AND NEXT WHETHER THOSE FORCES THAT GOVERNMENT OR REGIME
7264-92314-0009 COULD BE BETTER SERVED EVEN UNDER A SYSTEM OF PERMANENT CENSORSHIP THAN IT IS IN THE GREAT DAILIES OF LONDON AND THE PRINCIPAL PROVINCIAL CAPITALS IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH THE REGIME DESIRES TO BE SUPPRESSED SUPPRESSED IS NOT EVERYTHING WHICH IT DESIRES SUGGESTED SUGGESTED
7264-92314-0010 AND IS THERE ANY PUBLIC QUESTION WHICH WOULD WEAKEN THE REGIME AND THE DISCUSSION OF WHICH IS EVER ALLOWED TO APPEAR IN THE GREAT CAPITALIST JOURNALS THERE HAS NOT BEEN SUCH A CASE FOR AT LEAST TWENTY YEARS
7264-92314-0011 NEVER DEALS WITH MATTERS VITAL TO ITS PRESTIGE ON THE CONTRARY IT DELIBERATELY SIDE TRACKS ANY VITAL DISCUSSION THAT SINCERE CONVICTION MAY HAVE FORCED UPON THE PUBLIC AND SPOILS THE SCENT WITH FALSE ISSUES
7264-92314-0012 ONE PAPER NOT A LITTLE WHILE AGO WAS CLAMOURING AGAINST THE EXCESS OF LAWYERS IN GOVERNMENT ITS REMEDY WAS AN OPPOSITION TO BE HEADED BY A LAWYER ANOTHER WAS VERY SERIOUS UPON SECRET TRADING WITH THE ENEMY
7264-92314-0013 IT SUPPRESSED FOR MONTHS ALL REFERENCE TO THE ASTOUNDING INSTANCE OF THAT MISDEMEANOUR BY THE CONNECTIONS OF A VERY PROMINENT PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN EARLY IN THE WAR AND REFUSED TO COMMENT ON THE SINGLE REFERENCE MADE TO THIS CRIME IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS
7264-92314-0014 ANOTHER CLAMOURS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF ENEMY FINANCIAL POWER IN THE AFFAIRS OF THIS COUNTRY AND YET SAYS NOT A WORD UPON THE AUDITING OF THE SECRET PARTY FUNDS
7264-92314-0015 I SAY THAT THE BIG DAILY PAPERS HAVE NOW NOT ONLY THOSE OTHER QUALITIES DANGEROUS TO THE STATE WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED BUT THAT THEY HAVE BECOME ESSENTIALLY OFFICIAL THAT IS INSINCERE AND CORRUPT IN THEIR INTERESTED SUPPORT OF THAT PLUTOCRATIC COMPLEX WHICH IN THE DECAY OF ARISTOCRACY GOVERNS ENGLAND
7264-92314-0016 THEY ARE NOT INDEPENDENT WHERE POWER IS CONCERNED THEY DO NOT REALLY CRITICIZE THEY SERVE A CLIQUE WHOM THEY SHOULD EXPOSE AND DENOUNCE AND BETRAY THE GENERALITY THAT IS THE STATE FOR WHOSE SAKE THE SALARIED PUBLIC SERVANTS SHOULD BE PERPETUALLY WATCHED WITH SUSPICION AND SHARPLY KEPT IN CONTROL
7264-92314-0017 THE RESULT IS THAT THE MASS OF ENGLISHMEN HAVE CEASED TO OBTAIN OR EVEN TO EXPECT INFORMATION UPON THE WAY THEY ARE GOVERNED THEY ARE BEGINNING TO FEEL A CERTAIN UNEASINESS THEY KNOW THAT THEIR OLD POWER OF OBSERVATION OVER PUBLIC SERVANTS HAS SLIPPED FROM THEM
7264-92314-0018 THEY SUSPECT THAT THE KNOWN GROSS CORRUPTION OF PUBLIC LIFE AND PARTICULARLY OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS IS ENTRENCHED BEHIND A CONSPIRACY OF SILENCE ON THE PART OF THOSE VERY FEW WHO HAVE THE POWER TO INFORM THEM BUT AS YET THEY HAVE NOT PASSED THE STAGE OF SUCH SUSPICION
7264-92314-0019 THEY HAVE NOT ADVANCED NEARLY AS FAR AS THE DISCOVERY OF THE GREAT NEWSPAPER OWNERS AND THEIR SYSTEM THEY ARE STILL FOR THE MOST PART DUPED
7264-92314-0020 IS A VERY GREAT EVIL IT WARPS AND DEPLETES PUBLIC INFORMATION IT PREVENTS THE JUST CRITICISM OF PUBLIC SERVANTS ABOVE ALL IT GIVES IMMENSE AND IRRESPONSIBLE POWER TO A HANDFUL OF WEALTHY MEN
7264-92314-0021 AND ESPECIALLY TO THE ONE MOST WEALTHY AND UNSCRUPULOUS AMONG THEM WHOSE WEALTH IS AN ACCIDENT OF SPECULATION WHOSE ORIGINS ARE REPULSIVE AND WHOSE CHARACTERS HAVE AS A RULE THE WEAKNESS AND BASENESS DEVELOPED BY THIS SORT OF ADVENTURES
7264-92314-0022 THERE ARE AMONG SUCH GUTTER SNIPES THOUSANDS WHOSE LUCK ENDS IN THE NATIVE GUTTER HALF A DOZEN WHOSE LUCK LANDS THEM INTO MILLIONS ONE OR TWO AT MOST WHO ON THE TOP OF SUCH A CAREER GO CRAZY WITH THE AMBITION OF THE PARVENU AND PROPOSE TO DIRECT THE STATE
7264-92314-0023 EVEN WHEN GAMBLING ADVENTURERS OF THIS SORT ARE KNOWN AND RESPONSIBLE AS THEY ARE IN PROFESSIONAL POLITICS THEIR POWER IS A GRAVE DANGER POSSESSING AS THE NEWSPAPER OWNERS DO EVERY POWER OF CONCEALMENT AND AT THE SAME TIME
7264-92314-0024 NO SHRED OF RESPONSIBILITY TO ANY ORGAN OF THE STATE THEY ARE A DEADLY PERIL THE CHIEF OF THESE MEN ARE MORE POWERFUL TO DAY THAN ANY MINISTER NAY THEY DO AS I HAVE SAID AND IT IS NOW NOTORIOUS MAKE AND UNMAKE MINISTERS AND THEY MAY YET IN OUR WORST HOUR DECIDE THE NATIONAL FATE
7264-92314-0025 NOW TO EVERY HUMAN EVIL OF A POLITICAL SORT THAT HAS APPEARED IN HISTORY TO EVERY EVIL THAT IS AFFECTING THE STATE AND PROCEEDING FROM THE WILL OF MAN NOT FROM UNGOVERNABLE NATURAL FORCES OUTSIDE MAN THERE COMES A TERM AND A REACTION
7264-92314-0026 SIDE BY SIDE WITH WHAT I HAVE CALLED THE OFFICIAL PRESS IN OUR TOP HEAVY PLUTOCRACY THERE HAS ARISEN A CERTAIN FORCE FOR WHICH I HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING A NAME BUT WHICH I WILL CALL FOR LACK OF A BETTER NAME THE FREE PRESS I MIGHT CALL IT THE INDEPENDENT PRESS
7264-92314-0027 WERE IT NOT THAT SUCH A WORD WOULD CONNOTE AS YET A LITTLE TOO MUCH POWER THOUGH I DO BELIEVE ITS POWER TO BE RISING AND THOUGH I AM CONFIDENT THAT IT WILL IN THE NEAR FUTURE CHANGE OUR AFFAIRS
7264-92314-0028 I AM NOT ACQUAINTED WITH ANY OTHER MODERN LANGUAGE THAN FRENCH AND ENGLISH BUT I READ THIS FREE PRESS FRENCH AND ENGLISH COLONIAL AND AMERICAN REGULARLY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THE CHIEF INTELLECTUAL PHENOMENON OF OUR TIME
7264-92314-0029 IN FRANCE AND IN ENGLAND AND FOR ALL I KNOW ELSEWHERE THERE HAS ARISEN IN PROTEST AGAINST THE COMPLETE CORRUPTION AND FALSEHOOD OF THE GREAT CAPITALIST PAPERS A CROP OF NEW ORGANS WHICH ARE IN THE STRICTEST SENSE OF THE WORD ORGANS OF OPINION
7264-92314-0030 THE NEW AGE WAS I THINK THE PIONEER IN THE MATTER
7264-92314-0031 SCOTLAND ONE OR TWO THEIR NUMBER WILL INCREASE WITH THIS I PASS FROM THE JUST DENUNCIATION OF EVIL TO THE EXPOSITION OF WHAT IS GOOD
7264-92316-0000 THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA WHICH BEGAN TO WORK MUCH THE EARLIEST OF THE THREE CONCERNED RELIGIONS AND ALSO CERTAIN RACIAL ENTHUSIASMS OR POLITICAL DOCTRINES WHICH BY THEIR SINCERITY AND READINESS FOR SACRIFICE HAD HALF THE FORCE OF RELIGIONS
7264-92316-0001 MEN FOUND THAT THE GREAT PAPERS IN THEIR FINAL PHASE REFUSED TO TALK ABOUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORTANT IN RELIGION THEY DARED DO NOTHING BUT REPEAT VERY DISCREETLY THE VAGUEST ETHICAL PLATITUDES THEY HARDLY DARED DO EVEN THAT THEY TOOK FOR GRANTED A SORT OF INVERTEBRATE COMMON OPINION
7264-92316-0002 AND THERE WAS AN END OF IT GREAT BODIES OF MEN WHO CARED INTENSELY FOR A DEFINITE CREED FOUND THAT EXPRESSION FOR IT WAS LACKING
7264-92316-0003 THE ORGANS OF OPINION PROFESSED A GENTEEL IGNORANCE OF THAT IDEA WHICH WAS MOST WIDESPREAD MOST INTENSE AND MOST FORMATIVE
7264-92316-0004 THERE WAS NOTHING TO DISTINGUISH A LARGE DAILY PAPER OWNED BY A JEW FROM ONE OWNED BY AN AGNOSTIC OR A CATHOLIC NECESSITY OF EXPRESSION COMPELLED THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS IN CONNECTION WITH THIS ONE MOTIVE OF RELIGION MEN CAME ACROSS VERY LITTLE OF THIS IN ENGLAND
7264-92316-0005 BECAUSE ENGLAND WAS FOR LONG VIRTUALLY HOMOGENEOUS IN RELIGION AND THAT RELIGION WAS NOT ENTHUSIASTIC DURING THE YEARS IN WHICH THE FREE PRESS AROSE BUT SUCH A FREE PRESS IN DEFENCE OF RELIGION THE PIONEER OF ALL THE FREE PRESS AROSE IN IRELAND AND IN FRANCE AND ELSEWHERE
7264-92316-0006 BUT IT ASSERTED THE NECESSITY OF SPECIALLY EMPHASIZING ITS PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW IN ITS OWN COLUMNS FOR RELIGION AFFECTS ALL LIFE
7264-92316-0007 A GENERATION AGO AND MORE GREAT NUMBERS OF MEN WERE PERSUADED THAT A SOLUTION FOR THE WHOLE COMPLEX OF SOCIAL INJUSTICE WAS TO BE FOUND IN WHAT THEY CALLED NATIONALIZING THE MEANS OF PRODUCTION DISTRIBUTION AND EXCHANGE
7264-92316-0008 THAT IS OF COURSE IN PLAIN ENGLISH PUTTING LAND HOUSES AND MACHINERY AND STORES OF FOOD AND CLOTHING INTO THE HANDS OF THE POLITICIANS FOR CONTROL IN USE AND FOR DISTRIBUTION IN CONSUMPTION
7264-92316-0009 THIS CREED WAS HELD WITH PASSIONATE CONVICTION BY MEN OF THE HIGHEST ABILITY IN EVERY COUNTRY OF EUROPE AND A SOCIALIST PRESS BEGAN TO ARISE WHICH WAS EVERYWHERE FREE AND SOON IN ACTIVE OPPOSITION TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS
7264-92316-0010 AGAIN OF A RELIGIOUS TEMPER IN THEIR SEGREGATION CONVICTION AND ENTHUSIASM THERE BEGAN TO APPEAR WHEN THE OPPRESSOR WAS MILD THE SMALL PAPERS DEFENDING THE RIGHTS OF OPPRESSED NATIONALITIES
7264-92316-0011 RELIGION THEN AND COGNATE ENTHUSIASMS WERE THE FIRST BREEDERS OF THE FREE PRESS IT IS EXCEEDINGLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THIS BECAUSE IT HAS STAMPED THE WHOLE MOVEMENT WITH A PARTICULAR CHARACTER TO WHICH I SHALL LATER REFER WHEN I COME TO ITS DISABILITIES
7264-92316-0012 FELT NO PARTICULAR ANIMOSITY AGAINST THE DEBATS FOR INSTANCE HIS PARTICULAR CATHOLIC ENTHUSIASM RECOGNIZED ITSELF AS EXCEPTIONAL AND WAS CONTENT TO ACCEPT THE HUMBLE OR AT ANY RATE INFERIOR POSITION WHICH ADMITTED ECCENTRICITY CONNOTES LATER
7264-92316-0013 THESE FOUNDERS OF THE FREE PRESS SEEMED TO SAY WE MAY CONVERT THE MASS TO OUR VIEWS BUT FOR THE MOMENT WE ARE ADMITTEDLY A CLIQUE AN EXCEPTIONAL BODY WITH THE PENALTIES ATTACHING TO SUCH
7264-92316-0014 THEY SAID THIS ALTHOUGH THE WHOLE LIFE OF FRANCE IS AT LEAST AS CATHOLIC AS THE LIFE OF GREAT BRITAIN IS PLUTOCRATIC OR THE LIFE OF SWITZERLAND DEMOCRATIC AND THEY SAID IT BECAUSE THEY AROSE AFTER THE CAPITALIST PRESS NEUTRAL IN RELIGION AS IN EVERY VITAL THING
7264-92316-0015 HAD CAPTURED THE WHOLE FIELD THE FIRST PROPAGANDISTS THEN DID NOT STAND UP TO THE OFFICIAL PRESS AS EQUALS THEY CREPT IN AS INFERIORS OR RATHER AS OPEN EX CENTRICS
7264-92316-0016 FOR VICTORIAN ENGLAND AND THIRD EMPIRE FRANCE FALSELY PROCLAIMED THE REPRESENTATIVE QUALITY OF THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO THE HONOUR OF THE SOCIALIST MOVEMENT THE SOCIALIST FREE PRESS WAS THE FIRST TO STAND UP AS AN EQUAL AGAINST THE GIANTS
7264-92316-0017 TO PAPERS LIKE THE DAILY TELEGRAPH OR THE TIMES WITH THE EPITHET CAPITALIST PUT AFTER THEM IN BRACKETS I THOUGHT THEN IT WAS THE GIVING OF AN ABNORMAL EPITHET TO A NORMAL THING
7264-92316-0018 BUT I NOW KNOW THAT THESE SMALL SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS WERE TALKING THE PLAINEST COMMON SENSE WHEN THEY SPECIFICALLY EMPHASIZED AS CAPITALIST THE FALSEHOODS AND SUPPRESSIONS OF THEIR GREAT CONTEMPORARIES
7264-92316-0019 FROM THE SOCIALIST POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT THE INSINCERITY OF THE GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS IS THAT THIS INSINCERITY IS CAPITALIST JUST AS FROM A CATHOLIC POINT OF VIEW THE LEADING FACT ABOUT IT WAS AND IS THAT IT IS ANTI CATHOLIC
7264-92316-0020 THOUGH HOWEVER CERTAIN OF THE SOCIALIST FREE PAPERS THUS BOLDLY TOOK UP A STANDPOINT OF MORAL EQUALITY WITH THE OTHERS THEIR ATTITUDE WAS EXCEPTIONAL
7264-92316-0021 THE GREAT DAILIES WERE THOUGHT GREY NOT WICKED ONLY GENERAL AND VAGUE THE FREE PRESS IN ITS BEGINNINGS DID NOT ATTACK AS AN ENEMY IT ONLY TIMIDLY CLAIMED TO BE HEARD IT REGARDED ITSELF AS A SPECIALITY IT WAS HUMBLE AND THERE WENT WITH IT A MASS OF EX CENTRIC STUFF
7264-92316-0022 IF ONE PASSES IN REVIEW ALL THE FREE PRESS JOURNALS WHICH OWED THEIR EXISTENCE IN ENGLAND AND FRANCE ALONE TO THIS MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA ONE FINDS MANY SIDE SHOWS AS IT WERE BESIDE THE MAIN MOTIVES OF LOCAL OR RACE PATRIOTISM RELIGION OR SOCIALIST CONVICTION
7264-92316-0023 YOU HAVE THE SINGLE TAX PAPERS YOU HAVE THE TEETOTAL PAPERS AND REALLY IT IS A WONDER THAT YOU HAVE NOT YET ALSO HAD THE ICONOCLASTS AND THE DIABOLISTS PRODUCING PAPERS THE RATIONALIST AND THE ATHEIST PROPAGANDA I RECKON AMONG THE RELIGIOUS
7264-92316-0024 WE MAY TAKE IT THEN THAT PROPAGANDA WAS IN ORDER OF TIME THE FIRST MOTIVE OF THE FREE PRESS AND THE FIRST CAUSE OF ITS PRODUCTION NOW FROM THIS FACT ARISES A CONSIDERATION OF GREAT IMPORTANCE TO OUR SUBJECT
7264-92316-0025 I MEAN THAT THE FREE PRESS HAS HAD STAMPED UPON IT THE CHARACTER OF DISPARATE PARTICULARISM
7264-92316-0026 BUT I KNOW THAT WHEREVER I GET HOLD OF SUCH AN ORGAN IT WILL BE VERY STRONGLY COLOURED WITH THE OPINION OR EVEN FANATICISM OF SOME MINORITY THE FREE PRESS AS A WHOLE
7264-92316-0027 IF YOU ADD IT ALL UP AND CANCEL OUT ONE EXAGGERATED STATEMENT AGAINST ANOTHER DOES GIVE YOU A TRUE VIEW OF THE STATE OF SOCIETY IN WHICH YOU LIVE THE OFFICIAL PRESS TO DAY GIVES YOU AN ABSURDLY FALSE ONE EVERYWHERE
7264-92316-0028 NO ONE OF THEM IS IN ANY SENSE GENERAL OR REALLY NATIONAL THE FREE PRESS GIVES YOU THE TRUTH BUT ONLY IN DISJOINTED SECTIONS FOR IT IS DISPARATE AND IT IS PARTICULARIST IT IS MARKED WITH ISOLATION AND IT IS SO MARKED BECAUSE ITS ORIGIN LAY IN VARIOUS AND MOST DIVERSE PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0029 BECAUSE IT CAME LATER THAN THE OFFICIAL PRESS OF CAPITALISM AND WAS IN ITS ORIGINS BUT A REACTION AGAINST IT B THE SECOND MOTIVE THAT OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD CAME TO WORK MUCH LATER THAN THE MOTIVE OF PROPAGANDA
7264-92316-0030 MEN GRADUALLY CAME TO NOTICE THAT ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER OF GREAT PUBLIC INTEREST SOMETIMES OF VITAL PUBLIC INTEREST WAS DELIBERATELY SUPPRESSED IN THE PRINCIPAL GREAT OFFICIAL PAPERS AND THAT POSITIVE FALSEHOODS WERE INCREASINGLY SUGGESTED OR STATED
7264-92316-0031 THERE WAS MORE THAN THIS FOR LONG THE OWNER OF A NEWSPAPER HAD FOR THE MOST PART BEEN CONTENT TO REGARD IT AS A REVENUE PRODUCING THING THE EDITOR WAS SUPREME IN MATTERS OF CULTURE AND OPINION TRUE THE EDITOR BEING REVOCABLE AND POOR COULD NOT PRETEND TO FULL POLITICAL POWER
7264-92316-0032 BUT IT WAS A SORT OF DUAL ARRANGEMENT WHICH YET MODIFIED THE POWER OF THE VULGAR OWNER I MYSELF REMEMBER THAT STATE OF AFFAIRS THE EDITOR WHO WAS A GENTLEMAN AND DINED OUT THE PROPRIETOR WHO WAS A LORD AND NERVOUS WHEN HE MET A GENTLEMAN
7264-92316-0033 THE EDITOR BECAME AND NOW IS A MERE MOUTHPIECE OF THE PROPRIETOR EDITORS SUCCEED EACH OTHER RAPIDLY OF GREAT PAPERS TO DAY THE EDITOR'S NAME OF THE MOMENT IS HARDLY KNOWN
7264-92316-0034 BUT NOT A CABINET MINISTER THAT COULD NOT PASS AN EXAMINATION IN THE LIFE VICES VULNERABILITY FORTUNE INVESTMENTS AND FAVOURS OF THE OWNER THE CHANGE WAS RAPIDLY ADMITTED IT CAME QUICKLY BUT THOROUGHLY AT LAST LIKE MOST RAPID DEVELOPMENTS IT EXCEEDED ITSELF
7264-92316-0035 MEN OWNING THE CHIEF NEWSPAPERS COULD BE HEARD BOASTING OF THEIR POWER IN PUBLIC AS AN ADMITTED THING AND AS THIS POWER WAS RECOGNIZED AND AS IT GREW WITH TIME AND EXPERIMENT IT BRED A REACTION
7264-92316-0036 WHY SHOULD THIS OR THAT VULGARIAN MEN BEGAN TO SAY EXERCISE AND BOAST OF THE POWER TO KEEP THE PEOPLE IGNORANT UPON MATTERS VITAL TO US ALL TO DISTORT
7264-92316-0037 TO LIE THE SHEER NECESSITY OF GETTING CERTAIN TRUTHS TOLD WHICH THESE POWERFUL BUT HIDDEN FELLOWS REFUSED TO TELL WAS A FORCE WORKING AT HIGH POTENTIAL AND ALMOST COMPELLING THE PRODUCTION OF FREE PAPERS SIDE BY SIDE WITH THE BIG OFFICIAL ONES
7264-92316-0038 THAT IS WHY YOU NEARLY ALWAYS FIND THE FREE PRESS DIRECTED BY MEN OF INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION OF EXCEPTIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND CULTIVATION AND THAT IS WHERE IT CONTRASTS MOST WITH ITS OPPONENTS C
7264-92316-0039 BUT ONLY A LITTLE LATER THAN THIS SECOND MOTIVE OF INDIGNATION AGAINST FALSEHOOD AND ACTING WITH EQUAL FORCE THOUGH UPON FEWER MEN WAS THE THIRD MOTIVE OF FREEDOM OF INDIGNATION AGAINST ARBITRARY POWER
7264-92316-0040 BUT IT IS INTOLERABLE THAT SIMILAR POWER SHOULD RESIDE IN THE HANDS OF OBSCURE NOBODIES ABOUT WHOM NO ILLUSION COULD POSSIBLY EXIST WHOSE TYRANNY IS NOT ADMITTED OR PUBLIC AT ALL WHO DO NOT EVEN TAKE THE RISK OF EXPOSING THEIR FEATURES AND TO WHOM NO RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER ATTACHES
7264-92316-0041 THE KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WAS SO PROVIDED THE THIRD AND PERHAPS THE MOST POWERFUL MOTIVE FOR THE CREATION OF A FREE PRESS
7264-92316-0042 UNFORTUNATELY IT COULD AFFECT ONLY VERY FEW MEN WITH THE MASS EVEN OF WELL EDUCATED AND OBSERVANT MEN THE FEELING CREATED BY THE NOVEL POWER OF THE GREAT PAPERS WAS LITTLE MORE THAN A VAGUE ILL EASE
7264-92316-0043 THEY HAD A GENERAL CONCEPTION THAT THE OWNER OF A WIDELY CIRCULATED POPULAR NEWSPAPER COULD AND DID BLACKMAIL THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN MAKE OR UNMAKE THE PROFESSIONAL POLITICIAN BY GRANTING OR REFUSING HIM THE LIMELIGHT
7264-92316-0044 DISPOSE OF CABINETS NOMINATE ABSURD MINISTERS BUT THE PARTICULAR VIVID CONCRETE INSTANCES THAT SPECIALLY MOVE MEN TO ACTION WERE HIDDEN FROM THEM ONLY A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH SUCH PARTICULAR TRUTHS
7264-92316-0045 BUT THAT SMALL NUMBER KNEW VERY WELL THAT WE WERE THUS IN REALITY GOVERNED BY MEN RESPONSIBLE TO NO ONE AND HIDDEN FROM PUBLIC BLAME
7278-104730-0000 WERE BEFORE HIM IT WAS A PART OF HIS DESTINY TO BECOME THE CHAMPION OF THE ANTI SLAVERY CAUSE IN THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE
7278-104730-0001 WAS TO PRESENT FIFTEEN PETITIONS SIGNED NUMEROUSLY BY CITIZENS OF PENNSYLVANIA PRAYING FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY AND THE SLAVE TRADE IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HE SIMPLY MOVED THEIR REFERENCE TO THE COMMITTEE ON THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
7278-104730-0002 THAT HE HAD ALWAYS CHERISHED AN ABHORRENCE OF SLAVERY AND A BITTER ANTIPATHY TO SLAVE HOLDERS AS A CLASS IS SUFFICIENTLY INDICATED BY MANY CHANCE REMARKS SCATTERED
7278-104730-0003 MULTIPLYING FOR THE PURPOSE OF SPREADING AND INCREASING A POPULAR HOSTILITY TOWARDS THE GREAT
7278-104730-0004 AS WOULD INSURE DEFINITE RESULTS INSTEAD OF BEING WASTED IN ENDEAVORS WHICH AS YET WERE IMPOSSIBLE OF ACHIEVEMENT DRAWING HIS DUTY FROM HIS SITUATION AND SURROUNDINGS HE LEFT TO OTHERS TO YOUNGER MEN AND
7278-104730-0005 OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF CONGRESS THE BUSINESS OF FIRING THE PEOPLE AND STIRRING POPULAR OPINION AND SYMPATHY HE WAS SET TO DO THAT PORTION OF THE WORK OF ABOLITION WHICH WAS TO BE DONE IN CONGRESS
7278-104730-0006 TO ENCOUNTER THE MIGHTY EFFORTS WHICH WERE MADE TO STIFLE THE GREAT HUMANITARIAN CRY IN THE HALLS OF THE NATIONAL LEGISLATURE THIS WAS QUITE AS MUCH AS ONE MAN WAS EQUAL TO
7278-104730-0007 OVERAWE HIM NOR LONELINESS DISPIRIT HIM HE WAS PROBABLY THE MOST FORMIDABLE FIGHTER IN DEBATE OF WHOM PARLIAMENTARY RECORDS PRESERVE THE MEMORY
7278-104730-0008 THE LEADING LAWYERS THE RICH MERCHANTS THE SUCCESSFUL MANUFACTURERS NOT ONLY OPPOSED TO HIM BUT ENTERTAINING TOWARDS HIM SENTIMENTS OF PERSONAL DISLIKE AND EVEN VINDICTIVENESS THIS STRATUM OF THE COMMUNITY
7278-104730-0009 HAVING A NATURAL DISTASTE FOR DISQUIETING AGITATION AND INFLUENCED BY CLASS FEELING THE GENTLEMEN OF THE NORTH SYMPATHIZING WITH THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE SOUTH COULD NOT MAKE COMMON CAUSE WITH ANTI SLAVERY PEOPLE FORTUNATELY
7278-104730-0010 WAS AFTER ALL OF TRIFLING CONSEQUENCE TO HIM AND OF NO SERIOUS INFLUENCE UPON THE COURSE OF HISTORY THE OLD NEW ENGLAND INSTINCT WAS IN HIM AS IT WAS IN THE MASS OF THE PEOPLE THAT INSTINCT MADE HIM THE REAL EXPONENT OF NEW ENGLAND THOUGHT
7278-104730-0011 WHEN HIS FELLOW REPRESENTATIVES ALMOST TO A MAN DESERTED HIM HE WAS SUSTAINED BY MANY A TOKEN OF SYMPATHY AND ADMIRATION COMING FROM AMONG THE PEOPLE AT LARGE
7278-104730-0012 QUITE IN THE WRONG AND PREDESTINED TO WELL MERITED DEFEAT
7278-104730-0013 MISTER ADAMS AGAIN PRESENTED TWO PETITIONS FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BUT WITHOUT GIVING RISE TO MUCH EXCITEMENT THE
7278-104730-0014 AT THE NEXT SESSION OF CONGRESS THEY CONCLUDED TO TRY TO STOP IT AND THEIR INGENIOUS SCHEME WAS TO MAKE CONGRESS SHOT PROOF SO TO SPEAK AGAINST SUCH MISSILES ON JANUARY FOURTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SIX MISTER ADAMS PRESENTED AN ABOLITION PETITION
7278-104730-0015 BUT IN A MOMENT MISTER GLASCOCK OF GEORGIA MOVED THAT THE PETITION BE NOT RECEIVED DEBATE SPRANG UP ON A POINT OF ORDER AND TWO DAYS LATER BEFORE THE QUESTION OF RECEPTION WAS DETERMINED A RESOLUTION WAS OFFERED BY MISTER JARVIS OF MAINE
7278-104730-0016 DECLARING THAT THE HOUSE WOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY PETITIONS FOR THE ABOLITION
7278-104730-0017 ONE THAT CONGRESS HAD NO POWER TO INTERFERE WITH SLAVERY IN ANY STATE TWO THAT CONGRESS OUGHT NOT TO INTERFERE WITH SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
7278-104730-0018 THAT WHEREAS THE AGITATION OF THE SUBJECT WAS DISQUIETING AND OBJECTIONABLE ALL PETITIONS
7278-104730-0019 THEY HAD ASSUMED AN UNTENABLE POSITION HENCEFORTH
7278-104730-0020 MISTER ADAMS HAD A SUPPORT AMONG THE PEOPLE AT LARGE VASTLY GREATER THAN HE COULD HAVE ENJOYED AS THE OPPONENT OF SLAVERY AS HIS ADVERSARIES HAD SHAPED THE ISSUE HE WAS PREDESTINED TO VICTORY IN A FREE COUNTRY
7278-104730-0021 HAVING CONSTITUTED A VOTE MISTER ADAMS CALLED ATTENTION TO THE OMISSION THE CLERK BY DIRECTION OF THE SPEAKER THEREUPON CALLED HIS NAME
7278-104730-0022 THAT IT WAS NOT IN ORDER MIGHT BE ENTERED ON THE JOURNAL
7278-104730-0023 HE BROUGHT UP THE MATTER AGAIN ONE OF HIS OPPONENTS MADE A FALSE STEP AND MISTER ADAMS BANTERED HIM UPON IT UNTIL THE OTHER WAS PROVOKED INTO SAYING THAT IF THE QUESTION EVER CAME TO THE ISSUE OF WAR THE SOUTHERN PEOPLE
7278-104730-0024 NO ONE EVER GAINED MUCH IN A WAR OF WORDS WITH THIS EVER READY AND MERCILESS TONGUE
7278-104730-0025 INCIPIENT STAGE OF SUCH A CONFLICT THAT TESTS THE METTLE OF THE LITTLE BAND OF INNOVATORS WHEN IT GROWS INTO A GREAT PARTY QUESTION MUCH LESS COURAGE IS DEMANDED THE MERE PRESENTATION OF AN
7278-104730-0026 AS THEN MADE UP THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES WORE HARDLY EVEN UPON THE IRON TEMPER AND INFLEXIBLE DISPOSITION OF MISTER ADAMS THE MOST INSIGNIFICANT ERROR OF CONDUCT IN ME AT THIS TIME HE WRITES IN APRIL
7278-104730-0027 EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WOULD BE MY IRREDEEMABLE RUIN IN THIS WORLD AND BOTH THE RULING POLITICAL PARTIES ARE WATCHING WITH INTENSE ANXIETY FOR SOME OVERT ACT BY ME TO SET THE WHOLE PACK OF THEIR HIRELING PRESSES UPON ME
7278-104730-0028 THE EXTREMISTS WHO HAD CAST ASIDE ALL REGARD FOR WHAT WAS PRACTICABLE AND WHO UTTERLY SCORNED TO CONSIDER THE FEASIBILITY OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF MEASURES
7278-104730-0029 URGING HIM TO ACTION WHICH WOULD ONLY HAVE DESTROYED HIM FOREVER IN POLITICAL LIFE WOULD HAVE STRIPPED HIM OF HIS INFLUENCE EXILED HIM FROM THAT POSITION IN CONGRESS WHERE HE COULD RENDER THE MOST EFFICIENT SERVICE THAT WAS IN HIM
7278-104730-0030 I HAVE GONE HE SAID AS FAR UPON THIS ARTICLE THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY AS THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE FREE PORTION OF THE UNION WILL BEAR
7278-104730-0031 AND SO FAR THAT SCARCELY A SLAVE HOLDING MEMBER OF THE HOUSE DARES TO VOTE WITH ME UPON ANY QUESTION I HAVE AS YET BEEN THOROUGHLY SUSTAINED BY MY OWN STATE BUT ONE STEP FURTHER AND I HAZARD MY OWN STANDING AND INFLUENCE THERE
7278-104730-0032 MY OWN FINAL OVERTHROW AND THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY ITSELF FOR AN INDEFINITE TIME CERTAINLY FOR MORE THAN MY REMNANT OF LIFE WERE THERE IN THE HOUSE ONE MEMBER CAPABLE OF TAKING THE LEAD IN THIS CAUSE OF UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION
7278-104730-0033 WHICH IS MOVING ONWARD IN THE WORLD AND IN THIS COUNTRY I WOULD WITHDRAW FROM THE CONTEST WHICH WILL RAGE WITH INCREASING FURY AS IT DRAWS TO ITS CRISIS BUT FOR THE MANAGEMENT OF WHICH MY AGE INFIRMITIES AND APPROACHING END
7278-104730-0034 TOTALLY DISQUALIFY ME THERE IS NO SUCH MAN IN THE HOUSE SEPTEMBER FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN HE SAYS I HAVE BEEN FOR SOME TIME OCCUPIED DAY AND NIGHT
7278-104730-0035 NO RETURNED TO MY REQUEST FROM THE SERVILE SIDE OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT DAY HE PRESENTED FIFTY ONE MORE LIKE DOCUMENTS AND NOTES HAVING PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MORE
7278-104730-0036 IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN THIRTY SEVEN STILL AT THIS SAME WORK HE MADE A HARD BUT FRUITLESS EFFORT
7278-104730-0037 ALL LAID ON THE TABLE JANUARY FIFTEENTH HE PRESENTED FIFTY MORE JANUARY TWENTY EIGHTH HE RECEIVED THIRTY ONE PETITIONS AND SPENT THAT DAY AND THE NEXT IN ASSORTING AND FILING THESE AND OTHERS WHICH HE PREVIOUSLY HAD AMOUNTING IN ALL TO ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY
7278-104730-0038 FEBRUARY FOURTEENTH IN THE SAME YEAR WAS A FIELD DAY IN THE PETITION CAMPAIGN HE PRESENTED THEN NO LESS THAN THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY PETITIONS ALL BUT THREE OR FOUR OF WHICH BORE MORE OR LESS
7278-104730-0039 I SAID THAT IN ANOTHER PART OF THE CAPITOL IT HAD BEEN THREATENED THAT IF A NORTHERN ABOLITIONIST SHOULD GO TO NORTH CAROLINA AND UTTER A PRINCIPLE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE' HERE A LOUD CRY OF ORDER ORDER BURST FORTH IN WHICH THE SPEAKER YELLED THE LOUDEST
7278-104730-0040 I WAITED TILL IT SUBSIDED AND THEN RESUMED THAT IF THEY COULD CATCH HIM THEY WOULD HANG HIM I SAID THIS SO AS TO BE DISTINCTLY HEARD THROUGHOUT THE HALL THE RENEWED
7278-104730-0041 ORDER NOTWITHSTANDING THE SPEAKER THEN SAID THE GENTLEMAN FROM MASSACHUSETTS WILL TAKE HIS SEAT
7278-104730-0042 AND PRESENTED ANOTHER PETITION HE DID NOT DARE TELL ME
7278-246956-0000 AFTER THE SERMON AS THE SERMON DREW TO A CLOSE AND THE MIST OF HIS EMOTION BEGAN TO DISPERSE INDIVIDUAL FACES OF HIS AUDIENCE AGAIN DAWNED OUT ON THE PREACHER'S KEN
7278-246956-0001 MISTER DREW'S HEAD WAS DOWN AS I HAVE ALWAYS SAID CERTAIN THINGS HE HAD BEEN TAUGHT IN HIS YOUTH AND HAD PRACTISED IN HIS MANHOOD CERTAIN MEAN WAYS COUNTED HONEST ENOUGH IN THE TRADE HAD BECOME TO HIM
7278-246956-0002 REGARDED FROM THE IDEAL POINT OF THE DIVINE IN
7278-246956-0003 OF THE ADVANTAGES HE TOOK FOR HE KNEW THAT HE HAD KNOWN THEM SUCH AS SHRUNK FROM THE LIGHT NOT COMING
7278-246956-0004 HE WAS NOW DOING HIS BEST TO BANISH THEM FROM HIS BUSINESS AND YET THEY WERE A PAINFUL PRESENCE TO HIS SPIRIT SO GRIEVOUS TO BE BORNE
7278-246956-0005 FROM THEM BY THE INDWELLING PRESENCE OF THE GOD OF ALL LIVING MEN AND TRUE MERCHANTS WAS A BLESSEDNESS UNSPEAKABLE SMALL WAS THE SUSPICION IN THE ABBEY CHURCH OF OLASTON THAT MORNING
7278-246956-0006 BATTERY OF SIN SPRUNG SUFFERING WITHSTANDING AND ENDURING AND STILLING THE RECOIL OF THE AWFUL FORCE WHEREWITH HIS FATHER HAD LAUNCHED THE WORLDS AND GIVEN BIRTH TO HUMAN SOULS
7278-246956-0007 WITH WILLS THAT MIGHT BECOME FREE AS HIS OWN WHILE WINGFOLD HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN GENERAL TERMS WITH THE RACE IN HIS MIND'S AND THE CONGREGATION IN HIS BODY'S EYE HE HAD YET THOUGHT MORE OF ONE SOUL WITH ITS ONE CRIME AND ITS INTOLERABLE BURDEN
7278-246956-0008 THAN ALL THE REST LEOPOLD WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIM AND WHILE HE STROVE TO AVOID ABSORPTION IN A PERSONAL INTEREST HOWEVER JUSTIFIABLE IT WAS OF NECESSITY
7278-246956-0009 OF HIS UTTERANCE AT TIMES INDEED HE FELT AS IF HE WERE SPEAKING TO HIM IMMEDIATELY AND TO HIM ONLY AT OTHERS ALTHOUGH THEN HE SAW HER NO MORE THAN HIM
7278-246956-0010 THAT HE WAS COMFORTING THE SISTER INDIVIDUALLY IN HOLDING OUT TO HER BROTHER THE MIGHTY HOPE OF A RESTORED PURITY AND WHEN ONCE MORE HIS MIND COULD RECEIVE THE MESSAGES
7278-246956-0011 AND THE FIRM MOUTH HAD FORGOTTEN ITSELF INTO A TREMULOUS FORM WHICH THE STILLNESS OF ABSORPTION HAD THERE FOR THE MOMENT FIXED BUT EVEN ALREADY ALTHOUGH HE COULD NOT YET READ IT UPON HER
7278-246956-0012 COUNTENANCE A SNAKE HAD BEGUN TO LIFT ITS HEAD FROM THE CHAOTIC SWAMP WHICH RUNS A CREEK AT LEAST INTO EVERY SOUL THE RUDIMENTARY DESOLATION A REMNANT OF THE TIME
7278-246956-0013 WHEN THE WORLD WAS WITHOUT FORM AND VOID AND THE SNAKE SAID WHY THEN DID HE NOT SPEAK LIKE THAT TO MY LEOPOLD WHY DID HE NOT COMFORT HIM WITH SUCH A GOOD HOPE
7278-246956-0014 WELL BECOMING A PRIEST OF THE GENTLE JESUS OR IF HE FANCIED HE MUST SPEAK OF CONFESSION WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK OF IT IN PLAIN HONEST TERMS INSTEAD OF SUGGESTING THE IDEA OF IT SO THAT THE POOR BOY
7278-246956-0015 IMAGINED IT CAME FROM HIS OWN SPIRIT AND MUST THEREFORE BE OBEYED AS THE WILL OF GOD SO SAID THE SNAKE AND BY THE TIME HELEN HAD WALKED HOME WITH HER AUNT THE GLOW HAD SUNK FROM HER SOUL AND
7278-246956-0016 A GRAY WINTRY MIST HAD SETTLED DOWN UPON HER SPIRIT AND SHE SAID TO HERSELF THAT IF THIS LAST HOPE IN GEORGE SHOULD FAIL HER SHE WOULD NOT ALLOW THE MATTER TO TROUBLE HER ANY FARTHER
7278-246956-0017 SHE WAS A FREE WOMAN AND AS LEOPOLD HAD CHOSEN OTHER COUNSELLORS HAD THUS DECLARED HER UNWORTHY OF CONFIDENCE AND AFTER ALL THAT SHE HAD SUFFERED AND DONE FOR LOVE OF HIM
7278-246956-0018 HAD SHE NOT DONE ENOUGH WOULD EVEN HER FATHER REQUIRE MORE OF HER THAN SHE HAD ALREADY DONE AND ENDURED
7278-246956-0019 FROM THE COUCH SHE TOOK NO NOTICE THAT HE HAD GOT UP AND DRESSED WHILE SHE WAS AT CHURCH AND HE KNEW THAT A CLOUD HAD COME BETWEEN THEM AND THAT AFTER ALL SHE HAD BORNE AND DONE FOR HIM HE AND HIS SISTER WERE NOW FARTHER APART
7278-246956-0020 FOR THE TIME AT LEAST THAN WHEN OCEANS LAY BETWIXT THEIR BIRTH AND THEIR MEETING AND HE FOUND HIMSELF LOOKING BACK WITH VAGUE LONGING EVEN TO THE TERRIBLE OLD HOUSE OF GLASTON
7278-246956-0021 AND THE SHARING OF THEIR AGONY THEREIN HIS EYES FOLLOWED HER AS SHE WALKED ACROSS TO THE DRESSING ROOM AND THE TEARS ROSE AND FILLED THEM BUT HE SAID NOTHING AND THE SISTER WHO ALL THE TIME OF THE SERMON
7278-246956-0022 HAD BEEN FILLED WITH WAVE UPON WAVE OF WISHING THAT POLDIE COULD HEAR THIS COULD HEAR THAT COULD HAVE SUCH A THOUGHT TO COMFORT HIM SUCH A LOVELY WORD TO DRIVE THE HORROR FROM HIS SOUL
7278-246956-0023 NOW CAST ON HIM A CHILLY GLANCE AND SAID NEVER A WORD OF THE THINGS TO WHICH SHE HAD LISTENED WITH SUCH HEAVINGS OF THE SPIRIT OCEAN FOR SHE FELT WITH AN INSTINCT MORE RIGHTEOUS THAN HER WILL
7278-246956-0024 THAT THEY WOULD BUT STRENGTHEN HIM IN HIS DETERMINATION TO DO WHATEVER THE TEACHER OF THEM MIGHT APPROVE AS SHE REPASSED HIM TO GO TO THE DRAWING ROOM SHE DID INDEED SAY A WORD OF KINDNESS BUT IT WAS IN A FORCED TONE
7278-246956-0025 AND WAS ONLY ABOUT HIS DINNER HIS EYES OVER FLOWED BUT HE SHUT HIS LIPS SO TIGHT THAT HIS MOUTH GREW GRIM WITH DETERMINATION AND NO MORE TEARS CAME TO THE FRIEND WHO JOINED HER AT THE CHURCH DOOR AND IN GEORGE
7278-246956-0026 IN ORDER THEREBY TO ATTAIN TO A BETTER INNOCENCE THAN WITHOUT IT COULD EVER BE THEIRS HOW FAR SHE MISTOOK OR HOW FAR SHE KNEW OR SUSPECTED THAT SHE SPOKE FALSELY I WILL NOT PRETEND TO KNOW BUT ALTHOUGH SHE SPOKE AS SHE DID
7278-246956-0027 THERE WAS SOMETHING EITHER IN THE CURATE OR IN THE SERMON THAT HAD QUIETED HER A LITTLE AND SHE WAS LESS CONTEMPTUOUS IN HER CONDEMNATION OF HIM THAN USUAL HAPPILY BOTH FOR HIMSELF AND OTHERS THE CURATE
7278-246956-0028 WAS NOT ONE OF THOSE WHO CRIPPLE THE TRUTH AND BLIND THEIR OWN SOULS
7278-246956-0029 OCCASION TO THE DISHONEST TO CAVIL AND CONDEMN IMAGINE SAINT PAUL HAVING A PREVISION OF HOW HE WOULD BE MISUNDERSTOOD AND HEEDING IT WHAT WOULD THEN HAVE BECOME OF ALL THOSE HIS MOST MAGNIFICENT OUTBURSTS AND WOULD ANY AMOUNT OF
7278-246956-0030 APOSTOLIC CAREFULNESS HAVE PROTECTED HIM I SUSPECT IT WOULD ONLY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO MORE VULGAR MISUNDERSTANDINGS AND MISREPRESENTATIONS STILL TO EXPLAIN TO HIM WHO LOVES NOT IS BUT TO GIVE HIM THE MORE
7278-246956-0031 PLENTIFUL MATERIAL FOR MISINTERPRETATION LET A MAN HAVE TRUTH IN THE INWARD PARTS AND OUT OF THE ABUNDANCE OF HIS HEART LET HIS MOUTH SPEAK IF THEN HE SHOULD HAVE GROUND TO FEAR HONEST MISUNDERSTANDING
7278-246956-0032 LET HIM PREACH AGAIN TO ENFORCE THE TRUTH FOR WHICH HE IS JEALOUS AND IF IT SHOULD SEEM TO ANY THAT THE TWO UTTERANCES NEED RECONCILING LET THOSE WHO WOULD HAVE THEM CONSISTENT RECONCILE THEM FOR THEMSELVES
7278-246956-0033 THAT AFTER AN EARLY BREAKFAST HE HAD MOUNTED HELEN'S MARE AND SET OUT TO CALL ON MISTER HOOKER

730-358-0000 CHAPTER ELEVEN IT IS WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFICULTY THAT I REMEMBER THE ORIGINAL ERA OF MY BEING
730-358-0001 BY DEGREES I REMEMBER A STRONGER LIGHT PRESSED UPON MY NERVES SO THAT I WAS OBLIGED TO SHUT MY EYES DARKNESS THEN CAME OVER ME AND TROUBLED ME BUT HARDLY HAD I FELT THIS WHEN BY OPENING MY EYES AS I NOW SUPPOSE
730-358-0002 THE LIGHT POURED IN UPON ME AGAIN I WALKED AND I BELIEVE DESCENDED BUT I PRESENTLY FOUND A GREAT ALTERATION IN MY SENSATIONS BEFORE DARK AND OPAQUE BODIES HAD SURROUNDED ME
730-358-0003 THE LIGHT BECAME MORE AND MORE OPPRESSIVE TO ME
730-358-0004 THIS WAS THE FOREST NEAR INGOLSTADT AND HERE I LAY BY THE SIDE OF A BROOK RESTING FROM MY FATIGUE UNTIL I FELT TORMENTED BY HUNGER AND THIRST THIS ROUSED ME FROM MY NEARLY DORMANT STATE
730-358-0005 I SLAKED MY THIRST AT THE BROOK AND THEN LYING DOWN WAS OVERCOME BY SLEEP IT WAS DARK WHEN I AWOKE I FELT COLD ALSO AND HALF FRIGHTENED
730-358-0006 AS IT WERE INSTINCTIVELY FINDING MYSELF SO DESOLATE
730-358-0007 I HAD COVERED MYSELF WITH SOME CLOTHES BUT THESE WERE INSUFFICIENT TO SECURE ME FROM THE DEWS OF NIGHT
730-358-0008 I KNEW AND COULD DISTINGUISH NOTHING BUT FEELING PAIN INVADE ME ON ALL SIDES I SAT DOWN AND WEPT SOON A GENTLE LIGHT STOLE OVER THE HEAVENS AND GAVE ME A SENSATION OF PLEASURE
730-358-0009 THE MOON I GAZED WITH A KIND OF WONDER IT MOVED SLOWLY BUT IT ENLIGHTENED MY PATH AND I AGAIN WENT OUT IN SEARCH OF BERRIES I WAS STILL COLD WHEN UNDER ONE OF THE TREES I FOUND A HUGE CLOAK
730-358-0010 NO DISTINCT IDEAS OCCUPIED MY MIND ALL WAS CONFUSED I FELT LIGHT AND HUNGER AND THIRST AND DARKNESS INNUMERABLE SOUNDS RANG IN MY EARS AND ON ALL SIDES VARIOUS SCENTS SALUTED ME
730-358-0011 THE ONLY OBJECT THAT I COULD DISTINGUISH WAS THE BRIGHT MOON AND I FIXED MY EYES ON THAT WITH PLEASURE SEVERAL CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT PASSED AND THE ORB OF NIGHT HAD GREATLY LESSENED WHEN I BEGAN TO DISTINGUISH MY SENSATIONS FROM EACH OTHER
730-358-0012 I GRADUALLY SAW PLAINLY THE CLEAR STREAM THAT SUPPLIED ME WITH DRINK AND THE TREES THAT SHADED ME WITH THEIR FOLIAGE
730-358-0013 WHICH OFTEN SALUTED MY EARS PROCEEDED FROM THE THROATS OF THE LITTLE WINGED ANIMALS
730-358-0014 AND TO PERCEIVE THE BOUNDARIES OF THE RADIANT ROOF
730-358-0015 SOMETIMES I TRIED TO IMITATE THE PLEASANT SONGS OF THE BIRDS BUT WAS UNABLE SOMETIMES I WISHED TO EXPRESS MY SENSATIONS IN MY OWN MODE BUT THE UNCOUTH AND INARTICULATE SOUNDS WHICH BROKE FROM ME FRIGHTENED ME INTO SILENCE AGAIN
730-358-0016 THE MOON HAD DISAPPEARED FROM THE NIGHT AND AGAIN WITH A LESSENED FORM SHOWED ITSELF WHILE I STILL REMAINED IN THE FOREST MY SENSATIONS HAD BY THIS TIME BECOME DISTINCT AND MY MIND RECEIVED EVERY DAY ADDITIONAL IDEAS
730-358-0017 MY EYES BECAME ACCUSTOMED TO THE LIGHT AND TO PERCEIVE OBJECTS IN THEIR RIGHT FORMS I DISTINGUISHED THE INSECT FROM THE HERB AND BY DEGREES ONE HERB FROM ANOTHER
730-358-0018 ONE DAY WHEN I WAS OPPRESSED BY COLD I FOUND A FIRE WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY SOME WANDERING BEGGARS AND WAS OVERCOME WITH DELIGHT AT THE WARMTH I EXPERIENCED FROM IT
730-358-0019 IN MY JOY I THRUST MY HAND INTO THE LIVE EMBERS BUT QUICKLY DREW IT OUT AGAIN WITH A CRY OF PAIN HOW STRANGE I THOUGHT THAT THE SAME CAUSE SHOULD PRODUCE SUCH OPPOSITE EFFECTS I EXAMINED THE MATERIALS OF THE FIRE
730-358-0020 THE WET WOOD WHICH I HAD PLACED NEAR THE HEAT DRIED AND ITSELF BECAME INFLAMED I REFLECTED ON THIS AND BY TOUCHING THE VARIOUS BRANCHES
730-358-0021 AND THEN SPREADING MY CLOAK I LAY ON THE GROUND AND SANK INTO SLEEP IT WAS MORNING WHEN I AWOKE AND MY FIRST CARE WAS TO VISIT THE FIRE
730-358-0022 I OBSERVED THIS ALSO
730-358-0023 WHEN THEY WERE NEARLY EXTINGUISHED WHEN NIGHT CAME AGAIN I FOUND WITH PLEASURE THAT THE FIRE GAVE LIGHT AS WELL AS HEAT AND THAT THE DISCOVERY OF THIS ELEMENT WAS USEFUL TO ME IN MY FOOD
730-358-0024 AND TASTED MUCH MORE SAVOURY THAN THE BERRIES I GATHERED FROM THE TREES I TRIED THEREFORE TO DRESS MY FOOD IN THE SAME MANNER PLACING IT ON THE LIVE EMBERS
730-358-0025 AND THE NUTS AND ROOTS MUCH IMPROVED
730-358-0026 WHEN I FOUND THIS I RESOLVED TO QUIT THE PLACE THAT I HAD HITHERTO INHABITED TO SEEK FOR ONE WHERE THE FEW WANTS I EXPERIENCED
730-358-0027 AND KNEW NOT HOW TO REPRODUCE IT I GAVE SEVERAL HOURS TO THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF THIS DIFFICULTY
730-358-0028 I STRUCK ACROSS THE WOOD TOWARDS THE SETTING SUN I PASSED THREE DAYS IN THESE RAMBLES AND AT LENGTH DISCOVERED THE OPEN COUNTRY A GREAT FALL OF SNOW HAD TAKEN PLACE THE NIGHT BEFORE
730-358-0029 THE APPEARANCE WAS DISCONSOLATE AND I FOUND MY FEET CHILLED BY THE COLD DAMP SUBSTANCE THAT COVERED THE GROUND IT WAS ABOUT SEVEN IN THE MORNING AND I LONGED TO OBTAIN FOOD AND SHELTER AT LENGTH I PERCEIVED A SMALL HUT
730-358-0030 THIS WAS A NEW SIGHT TO ME AND I EXAMINED THE STRUCTURE WITH GREAT CURIOSITY FINDING THE DOOR OPEN I ENTERED AN OLD MAN SAT IN IT NEAR A FIRE OVER WHICH HE WAS PREPARING HIS BREAKFAST HE TURNED ON HEARING A NOISE AND PERCEIVING ME SHRIEKED LOUDLY
730-358-0031 HIS APPEARANCE DIFFERENT FROM ANY I HAD EVER BEFORE SEEN AND HIS FLIGHT SOMEWHAT SURPRISED ME
730-358-0032 AFTER THEIR SUFFERINGS IN THE LAKE OF FIRE I GREEDILY DEVOURED THE REMNANTS OF THE SHEPHERD'S BREAKFAST WHICH CONSISTED OF BREAD CHEESE MILK AND WINE THE LATTER HOWEVER I DID NOT LIKE THEN OVERCOME
730-358-0033 I LAY DOWN AMONG SOME STRAW AND FELL ASLEEP
730-358-0034 WHICH SHONE BRIGHTLY ON THE WHITE GROUND
730-358-0035 I PROCEEDED ACROSS THE FIELDS FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNTIL AT SUNSET I ARRIVED AT A VILLAGE
730-358-0036 ALLURED MY APPETITE ONE OF THE BEST OF THESE I ENTERED BUT I HAD HARDLY PLACED MY FOOT WITHIN THE DOOR BEFORE THE CHILDREN SHRIEKED AND ONE OF THE WOMEN FAINTED THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ROUSED SOME FLED SOME ATTACKED ME
730-358-0037 REFUGE IN A LOW HOVEL QUITE BARE AND MAKING A WRETCHED APPEARANCE AFTER THE PALACES I HAD BEHELD IN THE VILLAGE THIS HOVEL HOWEVER JOINED A COTTAGE OF A NEAT AND PLEASANT APPEARANCE BUT AFTER MY LATE DEARLY BOUGHT EXPERIENCE I DARED NOT ENTER IT
730-358-0038 NO WOOD HOWEVER WAS PLACED ON THE EARTH WHICH FORMED THE FLOOR BUT IT WAS DRY AND ALTHOUGH THE WIND ENTERED IT BY INNUMERABLE CHINKS I FOUND IT AN AGREEABLE ASYLUM FROM THE SNOW AND RAIN
730-358-0039 HOWEVER MISERABLE FROM THE INCLEMENCY OF THE SEASON AND STILL MORE FROM THE BARBARITY OF MAN
730-358-0040 THAT I MIGHT VIEW THE ADJACENT COTTAGE
730-358-0041 ONE PART WAS OPEN AND BY THAT I HAD CREPT IN BUT NOW I COVERED EVERY CREVICE BY WHICH I MIGHT BE PERCEIVED WITH STONES AND WOOD
730-358-0042 ALL THE LIGHT I ENJOYED CAME THROUGH THE STY
730-358-0043 HAVING THUS ARRANGED MY DWELLING AND CARPETED IT WITH CLEAN STRAW I RETIRED FOR I SAW THE FIGURE OF A MAN AT A DISTANCE AND I REMEMBERED TOO WELL MY TREATMENT THE NIGHT BEFORE TO TRUST MYSELF IN HIS POWER
730-358-0044 BY A LOAF OF COARSE BREAD WHICH I PURLOINED AND A CUP
730-358-0045 WHICH FLOWED BY MY RETREAT THE FLOOR WAS A LITTLE RAISED SO THAT IT WAS KEPT PERFECTLY DRY AND BY ITS VICINITY TO THE CHIMNEY OF THE COTTAGE IT WAS TOLERABLY WARM
730-358-0046 THE RAIN DROPPING BRANCHES AND DANK EARTH I ATE MY BREAKFAST WITH PLEASURE AND WAS ABOUT TO REMOVE A PLANK TO PROCURE MYSELF A LITTLE WATER WHEN I HEARD A STEP AND LOOKING THROUGH A SMALL CHINK I BEHELD A YOUNG CREATURE
730-358-0047 WITH A PAIL ON HER HEAD PASSING BEFORE MY HOVEL THE GIRL WAS YOUNG AND OF GENTLE DEMEANOUR
730-358-0048 HER FAIR HAIR WAS PLAITED BUT NOT ADORNED SHE LOOKED PATIENT YET SAD
730-358-0049 AND IN ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE RETURNED BEARING THE PAIL WHICH WAS NOW PARTLY FILLED WITH MILK AS SHE WALKED ALONG
730-358-0050 PRESENTLY I SAW THE YOUNG MAN AGAIN WITH SOME TOOLS IN HIS HAND CROSS THE FIELD BEHIND THE COTTAGE
730-358-0051 ON EXAMINING MY DWELLING I FOUND THAT ONE OF THE WINDOWS OF THE COTTAGE HAD FORMERLY OCCUPIED A PART OF IT BUT THE PANES HAD BEEN FILLED UP WITH WOOD IN ONE OF THESE WAS A SMALL AND ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLE CHINK THROUGH WHICH THE EYE COULD JUST PENETRATE
730-358-0052 WHITEWASHED AND CLEAN BUT VERY BARE OF FURNITURE IN ONE CORNER NEAR A SMALL FIRE SAT AN OLD MAN LEANING HIS HEAD ON HIS HANDS IN A DISCONSOLATE ATTITUDE THE YOUNG GIRL WAS OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE BUT PRESENTLY
730-358-0053 WHO TAKING UP AN INSTRUMENT BEGAN TO PLAY AND TO PRODUCE SOUNDS SWEETER THAN THE VOICE OF THE THRUSH OR THE NIGHTINGALE IT WAS A LOVELY SIGHT
730-358-0054 THE SILVER HAIR AND BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF THE AGED COTTAGER
730-358-0055 HE RAISED HER AND SMILED WITH SUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION THAT I FELT SENSATIONS OF A PECULIAR AND OVERPOWERING NATURE
730-358-0056 AND I WITHDREW FROM THE WINDOW UNABLE TO BEAR THESE EMOTIONS
730-358-0057 BEARING ON HIS SHOULDERS A LOAD OF WOOD THE GIRL MET HIM AT THE DOOR HELPED TO RELIEVE HIM OF HIS BURDEN AND TAKING SOME OF THE FUEL INTO THE COTTAGE PLACED IT ON THE FIRE THEN SHE AND THE YOUTH WENT APART INTO A NOOK OF THE COTTAGE
730-358-0058 AND HE SHOWED HER A LARGE LOAF AND A PIECE OF CHEESE SHE SEEMED PLEASED AND WENT INTO THE GARDEN FOR SOME ROOTS AND PLANTS WHICH SHE PLACED IN WATER AND THEN UPON THE FIRE
730-358-0059 AND APPEARED BUSILY EMPLOYED IN DIGGING AND PULLING UP ROOTS
730-358-0060 THE OLD MAN HAD IN THE MEANTIME BEEN PENSIVE BUT ON THE APPEARANCE OF HIS COMPANIONS
730-358-0061 THE MEAL WAS QUICKLY DISPATCHED THE YOUNG WOMAN WAS AGAIN OCCUPIED IN ARRANGING THE COTTAGE THE OLD MAN WALKED BEFORE THE COTTAGE IN THE SUN FOR A FEW MINUTES LEANING ON THE ARM OF THE YOUTH NOTHING COULD EXCEED IN BEAUTY THE CONTRAST BETWEEN THESE TWO EXCELLENT CREATURES
730-358-0062 BUT TO MY EXTREME WONDER
730-358-0063 DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE PLEASURE I EXPERIENCED IN WATCHING MY HUMAN NEIGHBOURS
730-358-0064 THE YOUTH BEGAN NOT TO PLAY BUT TO UTTER SOUNDS THAT WERE MONOTONOUS AND NEITHER RESEMBLING THE HARMONY OF THE OLD MAN'S INSTRUMENT NOR THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS
730-359-0000 I LAY ON MY STRAW BUT I COULD NOT SLEEP I THOUGHT OF THE OCCURRENCES OF THE DAY WHAT CHIEFLY STRUCK ME WAS THE GENTLE MANNERS OF THESE PEOPLE AND I LONGED TO JOIN THEM BUT DARED NOT
730-359-0001 WHICH INFLUENCED THEIR ACTIONS THE COTTAGERS AROSE THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE SUN THE YOUNG WOMAN ARRANGED THE COTTAGE AND PREPARED THE FOOD AND THE YOUTH DEPARTED AFTER THE FIRST MEAL
730-359-0002 THIS DAY WAS PASSED IN THE SAME ROUTINE AS THAT WHICH PRECEDED IT THE YOUNG MAN WAS CONSTANTLY EMPLOYED OUT OF DOORS AND THE GIRL IN VARIOUS LABORIOUS OCCUPATIONS WITHIN THE OLD MAN WHOM I SOON PERCEIVED TO BE BLIND
730-359-0003 EMPLOYED HIS LEISURE HOURS ON HIS INSTRUMENT OR IN CONTEMPLATION NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE LOVE AND RESPECT WHICH THE YOUNGER COTTAGERS EXHIBITED TOWARDS THEIR VENERABLE COMPANION
730-359-0004 AND DUTY WITH GENTLENESS AND HE REWARDED THEM
730-359-0005 THEY WERE NOT ENTIRELY HAPPY THE YOUNG MAN AND HIS COMPANION OFTEN WENT APART AND APPEARED TO WEEP I SAW NO CAUSE FOR THEIR UNHAPPINESS BUT I WAS DEEPLY AFFECTED BY IT IF SUCH LOVELY CREATURES WERE MISERABLE
730-359-0006 IT WAS LESS STRANGE THAT I AN IMPERFECT AND SOLITARY BEING SHOULD BE WRETCHED YET WHY WERE THESE GENTLE BEINGS UNHAPPY
730-359-0007 THEY WERE DRESSED IN EXCELLENT CLOTHES AND STILL MORE THEY ENJOYED ONE ANOTHER'S COMPANY AND SPEECH INTERCHANGING EACH DAY LOOKS OF AFFECTION AND KINDNESS WHAT DID THEIR TEARS IMPLY
730-359-0008 A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD ELAPSED
730-359-0009 IT WAS POVERTY AND THEY SUFFERED THAT EVIL IN A VERY DISTRESSING DEGREE THEIR NOURISHMENT CONSISTED ENTIRELY OF THE VEGETABLES OF THEIR GARDEN AND THE MILK OF ONE COW WHICH GAVE VERY LITTLE DURING THE WINTER
730-359-0010 WHEN ITS MASTERS COULD SCARCELY PROCURE FOOD TO SUPPORT IT THEY OFTEN I BELIEVE SUFFERED THE PANGS OF HUNGER VERY POIGNANTLY ESPECIALLY THE TWO YOUNGER COTTAGERS FOR SEVERAL TIMES THEY PLACED FOOD BEFORE THE OLD MAN WHEN THEY RESERVED NONE FOR THEMSELVES
730-359-0011 THIS TRAIT OF KINDNESS MOVED ME SENSIBLY I HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED DURING THE NIGHT TO STEAL A PART OF THEIR STORE FOR MY OWN CONSUMPTION
730-359-0012 I ABSTAINED AND SATISFIED MYSELF WITH BERRIES NUTS AND ROOTS WHICH I GATHERED FROM A NEIGHBOURING WOOD
730-359-0013 AND BROUGHT HOME FIRING SUFFICIENT FOR THE CONSUMPTION OF SEVERAL DAYS
730-359-0014 THE YOUNG WOMAN WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR IN THE MORNING
730-359-0015 SHE UTTERED SOME WORDS IN A LOUD VOICE AND THE YOUTH JOINED HER WHO ALSO EXPRESSED SURPRISE I OBSERVED WITH PLEASURE THAT HE DID NOT GO TO THE FOREST THAT DAY BUT SPENT IT IN REPAIRING THE COTTAGE AND CULTIVATING THE GARDEN
730-359-0016 BY DEGREES I MADE A DISCOVERY OF STILL GREATER MOMENT I FOUND THAT THESE PEOPLE POSSESSED A METHOD OF COMMUNICATING THEIR EXPERIENCE AND FEELINGS TO ONE ANOTHER BY ARTICULATE SOUNDS
730-359-0017 I PERCEIVED THAT THE WORDS THEY SPOKE SOMETIMES PRODUCED PLEASURE OR PAIN SMILES OR SADNESS IN THE MINDS AND COUNTENANCES OF THE HEARERS THIS WAS INDEED A GODLIKE SCIENCE AND I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH IT
730-359-0018 BUT I WAS BAFFLED IN EVERY ATTEMPT I MADE FOR THIS PURPOSE
730-359-0019 NOT HAVING ANY APPARENT CONNECTION WITH VISIBLE OBJECTS I WAS UNABLE TO DISCOVER ANY CLUE BY WHICH I COULD UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY OF THEIR REFERENCE BY GREAT APPLICATION HOWEVER
730-359-0020 AND AFTER HAVING REMAINED DURING THE SPACE OF SEVERAL REVOLUTIONS OF THE MOON IN MY HOVEL I DISCOVERED THE NAMES THAT WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE MOST FAMILIAR OBJECTS OF DISCOURSE I LEARNED AND APPLIED THE WORDS FIRE MILK BREAD AND WOOD
730-359-0021 BUT THE OLD MAN HAD ONLY ONE WHICH WAS FATHER THE GIRL WAS CALLED SISTER OR AGATHA AND THE YOUTH FELIX BROTHER OR SON I CANNOT DESCRIBE THE DELIGHT I FELT
730-359-0022 WHEN I LEARNED THE IDEAS APPROPRIATED TO EACH OF THESE SOUNDS AND WAS ABLE TO PRONOUNCE THEM
730-359-0023 AS YET TO UNDERSTAND OR APPLY THEM SUCH AS GOOD DEAREST UNHAPPY I SPENT THE WINTER IN THIS MANNER THE GENTLE MANNERS AND BEAUTY OF THE COTTAGERS GREATLY ENDEARED THEM TO ME
730-359-0024 WHEN THEY WERE UNHAPPY I FELT DEPRESSED WHEN THEY REJOICED I SYMPATHIZED IN THEIR JOYS
730-359-0025 OFTEN ENDEAVOURED TO ENCOURAGE HIS CHILDREN AS SOMETIMES I FOUND THAT HE CALLED THEM TO CAST OFF THEIR MELANCHOLY
730-359-0026 AGATHA LISTENED WITH RESPECT HER EYES SOMETIMES FILLED WITH TEARS WHICH SHE ENDEAVOURED TO WIPE AWAY UNPERCEIVED
730-359-0027 AND TONE WERE MORE CHEERFUL AFTER HAVING LISTENED TO THE EXHORTATIONS OF HER FATHER IT WAS NOT THUS WITH FELIX HE WAS ALWAYS THE SADDEST OF THE GROUP AND EVEN TO MY UNPRACTISED SENSES HE APPEARED TO HAVE SUFFERED MORE DEEPLY THAN HIS FRIENDS
730-359-0028 BUT IF HIS COUNTENANCE WAS MORE SORROWFUL
730-359-0029 ESPECIALLY WHEN HE ADDRESSED THE OLD MAN I COULD MENTION INNUMERABLE INSTANCES WHICH ALTHOUGH SLIGHT
730-359-0030 IN THE MIDST OF POVERTY AND WANT
730-359-0031 FROM BENEATH THE SNOWY GROUND EARLY IN THE MORNING BEFORE SHE HAD RISEN
730-359-0032 WHERE TO HIS PERPETUAL ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND HIS STORE ALWAYS REPLENISHED BY AN INVISIBLE HAND IN THE DAY I BELIEVE HE WORKED SOMETIMES FOR A NEIGHBOURING FARMER BECAUSE HE OFTEN WENT FORTH AND DID NOT RETURN UNTIL DINNER YET BROUGHT NO WOOD WITH HIM
730-359-0033 HE READ TO THE OLD MAN AND AGATHA THIS READING HAD PUZZLED ME EXTREMELY AT FIRST BUT BY DEGREES I DISCOVERED THAT HE UTTERED MANY OF THE SAME SOUNDS WHEN HE READ AS WHEN HE TALKED I CONJECTURED THEREFORE
730-359-0034 THAT HE FOUND ON THE PAPER SIGNS FOR SPEECH WHICH HE UNDERSTOOD AND I ARDENTLY LONGED TO COMPREHEND THESE ALSO BUT HOW WAS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN I DID NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND THE SOUNDS FOR WHICH THEY STOOD AS SIGNS I IMPROVED HOWEVER SENSIBLY IN THIS SCIENCE
730-359-0035 OF CONVERSATION ALTHOUGH I APPLIED MY WHOLE MIND TO THE ENDEAVOUR
730-359-0036 TO DISCOVER MYSELF TO THE COTTAGERS
730-359-0037 WHICH KNOWLEDGE MIGHT ENABLE ME TO MAKE THEM OVERLOOK THE DEFORMITY OF MY FIGURE
730-359-0038 AS THE SUN BECAME WARMER AND THE LIGHT OF DAY LONGER
730-359-0039 FROM THIS TIME FELIX WAS MORE EMPLOYED AND THE HEART MOVING INDICATIONS OF IMPENDING FAMINE DISAPPEARED
730-359-0040 AND THEY PROCURED A SUFFICIENCY OF IT SEVERAL NEW KINDS OF PLANTS SPRANG UP IN THE GARDEN WHICH THEY DRESSED AND THESE SIGNS OF COMFORT INCREASED DAILY AS THE SEASON ADVANCED THE OLD MAN LEANING ON HIS SON
730-359-0041 MY MODE OF LIFE IN MY HOVEL WAS UNIFORM DURING THE MORNING I ATTENDED THE MOTIONS OF THE COTTAGERS AND WHEN THEY WERE DISPERSED IN VARIOUS OCCUPATIONS I SLEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WAS SPENT IN OBSERVING MY FRIENDS
730-359-0042 WHEN THEY HAD RETIRED TO REST IF THERE WAS ANY MOON OR THE NIGHT WAS STAR LIGHT
730-359-0043 AND ONCE OR TWICE I HEARD THEM ON THESE OCCASIONS UTTER THE WORDS GOOD SPIRIT WONDERFUL
730-359-0044 MY THOUGHTS NOW BECAME MORE ACTIVE AND I LONGED TO DISCOVER THE MOTIVES AND FEELINGS OF THESE LOVELY CREATURES I WAS INQUISITIVE TO KNOW WHY FELIX APPEARED SO MISERABLE AND AGATHA SO SAD I THOUGHT FOOLISH WRETCH
730-359-0045 THAT IT MIGHT BE IN MY POWER TO RESTORE HAPPINESS TO THESE DESERVING PEOPLE WHEN I SLEPT OR WAS ABSENT THE FORMS OF THE VENERABLE BLIND FATHER
730-359-0046 I IMAGINED THAT THEY WOULD BE DISGUSTED UNTIL
730-359-0047 AND LED ME TO APPLY WITH FRESH ARDOUR TO THE ACQUIRING THE ART OF LANGUAGE MY ORGANS WERE INDEED HARSH BUT SUPPLE AND ALTHOUGH MY VOICE WAS VERY UNLIKE THE SOFT MUSIC OF THEIR TONES YET I PRONOUNCED SUCH WORDS AS I UNDERSTOOD WITH TOLERABLE EASE
730-359-0048 GREATLY ALTERED THE ASPECT OF THE EARTH MEN WHO BEFORE THIS CHANGE SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN HID IN CAVES DISPERSED THEMSELVES AND WERE EMPLOYED IN VARIOUS ARTS OF CULTIVATION
730-359-0049 HAPPY HAPPY EARTH FIT HABITATION FOR GODS WHICH SO SHORT A TIME BEFORE
730-359-0050 MY SPIRITS WERE ELEVATED BY THE ENCHANTING APPEARANCE OF NATURE
730-360-0000 I NOW HASTEN TO THE MORE MOVING PART OF MY STORY I SHALL RELATE EVENTS THAT IMPRESSED ME WITH FEELINGS WHICH FROM WHAT I HAD BEEN HAVE MADE ME WHAT I AM
730-360-0001 IT SURPRISED ME THAT WHAT BEFORE WAS DESERT AND GLOOMY SHOULD NOW BLOOM WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL FLOWERS AND VERDURE
730-360-0002 MY SENSES WERE GRATIFIED AND REFRESHED BY A THOUSAND SCENTS OF DELIGHT AND A THOUSAND SIGHTS OF BEAUTY IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE DAYS WHEN MY COTTAGERS PERIODICALLY RESTED FROM LABOUR THE OLD MAN PLAYED ON HIS GUITAR
730-360-0003 THAT I OBSERVED THE COUNTENANCE OF FELIX WAS MELANCHOLY BEYOND EXPRESSION HE SIGHED FREQUENTLY AND ONCE HIS FATHER PAUSED IN HIS MUSIC AND I CONJECTURED
730-360-0004 THAT HE INQUIRED THE CAUSE OF HIS SON'S SORROW FELIX REPLIED IN A CHEERFUL ACCENT AND THE OLD MAN WAS RECOMMENCING HIS MUSIC WHEN SOMEONE TAPPED AT THE DOOR IT WAS A LADY ON HORSEBACK ACCOMPANIED BY A COUNTRY MAN AS A GUIDE
730-360-0005 THE LADY WAS DRESSED IN A DARK SUIT AND COVERED WITH A THICK BLACK VEIL AGATHA ASKED A QUESTION TO WHICH THE STRANGER ONLY REPLIED BY PRONOUNCING IN A SWEET ACCENT THE NAME OF FELIX
730-360-0006 ON HEARING THIS WORD FELIX CAME UP HASTILY TO THE LADY WHO WHEN SHE SAW HIM THREW UP HER VEIL
730-360-0007 AND HER COMPLEXION WONDROUSLY FAIR
730-360-0008 EVERY TRAIT OF SORROW VANISHED FROM HIS FACE AND IT INSTANTLY EXPRESSED A DEGREE OF ECSTATIC JOY OF WHICH I COULD HARDLY HAVE BELIEVED IT CAPABLE
730-360-0009 SHE APPEARED AFFECTED BY DIFFERENT FEELINGS WIPING A FEW TEARS FROM HER LOVELY EYES
730-360-0010 SHE DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM BUT SMILED HE ASSISTED HER TO DISMOUNT AND DISMISSING HER GUIDE CONDUCTED HER INTO THE COTTAGE
730-360-0011 AND WOULD HAVE KISSED HIS HAND BUT HE RAISED HER AND EMBRACED HER AFFECTIONATELY
730-360-0012 SHE WAS NEITHER UNDERSTOOD BY NOR HERSELF UNDERSTOOD THE COTTAGERS THEY MADE MANY SIGNS WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND BUT I SAW THAT HER PRESENCE DIFFUSED GLADNESS THROUGH THE COTTAGE DISPELLING THEIR SORROW AS THE SUN DISSIPATES THE MORNING MISTS
730-360-0013 AND POINTING TO HER BROTHER MADE SIGNS WHICH APPEARED TO ME TO MEAN THAT HE HAD BEEN SORROWFUL UNTIL SHE CAME SOME HOURS PASSED THUS WHILE THEY BY THEIR COUNTENANCES EXPRESSED JOY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I DID NOT COMPREHEND
730-360-0014 PRESENTLY I FOUND BY THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF SOME SOUND WHICH THE STRANGER REPEATED AFTER THEM THAT SHE WAS ENDEAVOURING TO LEARN THEIR LANGUAGE AND THE IDEA INSTANTLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT I SHOULD MAKE USE OF THE SAME INSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAME END
730-360-0015 RETIRED EARLY WHEN THEY SEPARATED FELIX KISSED THE HAND OF THE STRANGER AND SAID GOOD NIGHT SWEET SAFIE HE SAT UP MUCH LONGER CONVERSING WITH HIS FATHER AND BY THE FREQUENT REPETITION OF HER NAME I CONJECTURED THAT THEIR LOVELY GUEST
730-360-0016 WAS THE SUBJECT OF THEIR CONVERSATION I ARDENTLY DESIRED TO UNDERSTAND THEM AND BENT EVERY FACULTY TOWARDS THAT PURPOSE BUT FOUND IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THE NEXT MORNING FELIX WENT OUT TO HIS WORK
730-360-0017 AND AFTER THE USUAL OCCUPATIONS OF AGATHA WERE FINISHED THE ARABIAN SAT AT THE FEET OF THE OLD MAN AND TAKING HIS GUITAR PLAYED SOME AIRS SO ENTRANCINGLY BEAUTIFUL THAT THEY AT ONCE DREW TEARS OF SORROW AND DELIGHT FROM MY EYES
730-360-0018 WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE GAVE THE GUITAR TO AGATHA WHO AT FIRST DECLINED IT SHE PLAYED A SIMPLE AIR AND HER VOICE ACCOMPANIED IT IN SWEET ACCENTS BUT UNLIKE THE WONDROUS STRAIN OF THE STRANGER
730-360-0019 THE OLD MAN APPEARED ENRAPTURED AND SAID SOME WORDS WHICH AGATHA ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN TO SAFIE AND BY WHICH HE APPEARED TO WISH TO EXPRESS THAT SHE BESTOWED ON HIM THE GREATEST DELIGHT BY HER MUSIC
730-360-0020 THE DAYS NOW PASSED AS PEACEABLY AS BEFORE WITH THE SOLE ALTERATION THAT
730-360-0021 IN THE COUNTENANCES OF MY FRIENDS SAFIE WAS ALWAYS GAY AND HAPPY SHE AND I IMPROVED RAPIDLY IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF LANGUAGE SO THAT IN TWO MONTHS I BEGAN TO COMPREHEND MOST OF THE WORDS UTTERED BY MY PROTECTORS
730-360-0022 IN THE MEANWHILE ALSO THE BLACK GROUND WAS COVERED WITH HERBAGE AND THE GREEN BANKS INTERSPERSED WITH INNUMERABLE FLOWERS SWEET TO THE SCENT AND THE EYES STARS OF PALE RADIANCE AMONG THE MOONLIGHT WOODS THE SUN BECAME WARMER THE NIGHTS CLEAR AND BALMY
730-360-0023 ALTHOUGH THEY WERE CONSIDERABLY SHORTENED BY THE LATE SETTING AND EARLY RISING OF THE SUN FOR I NEVER VENTURED ABROAD DURING DAYLIGHT
730-360-0024 MY DAYS WERE SPENT IN CLOSE ATTENTION THAT I MIGHT MORE SPEEDILY MASTER THE LANGUAGE AND I MAY BOAST
730-360-0025 WHO UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE AND CONVERSED IN BROKEN ACCENTS WHILST I COMPREHENDED AND COULD IMITATE ALMOST EVERY WORD THAT WAS SPOKEN WHILE I IMPROVED IN SPEECH I ALSO LEARNED THE SCIENCE OF LETTERS AS IT WAS TAUGHT TO THE STRANGER AND THIS OPENED BEFORE ME
730-360-0026 THE BOOK FROM WHICH FELIX INSTRUCTED SAFIE WAS VOLNEY'S RUINS OF EMPIRES I SHOULD NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD THE PURPORT OF THIS BOOK HAD NOT FELIX IN READING IT
730-360-0027 HE HAD CHOSEN THIS WORK HE SAID BECAUSE THE DECLAMATORY STYLE WAS FRAMED IN IMITATION OF THE EASTERN AUTHORS
730-360-0028 AND A VIEW OF THE SEVERAL EMPIRES AT PRESENT EXISTING IN THE WORLD IT GAVE ME AN INSIGHT INTO THE MANNERS GOVERNMENTS AND RELIGIONS OF THE DIFFERENT NATIONS OF THE EARTH
730-360-0029 DEGENERATING OF THE DECLINE OF THAT MIGHTY EMPIRE OF CHIVALRY CHRISTIANITY AND KINGS I HEARD OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE AMERICAN HEMISPHERE
730-360-0030 INHABITANTS THESE WONDERFUL NARRATIONS INSPIRED ME WITH STRANGE FEELINGS WAS MAN INDEED AT ONCE SO POWERFUL SO VIRTUOUS AND MAGNIFICENT YET SO VICIOUS AND BASE
730-360-0031 AND AT ANOTHER AS ALL THAT CAN BE CONCEIVED OF NOBLE AND GODLIKE TO BE A GREAT AND VIRTUOUS MAN APPEARED THE HIGHEST HONOUR THAT CAN BEFALL A SENSITIVE BEING TO BE BASE AND VICIOUS AS MANY ON RECORD HAVE BEEN APPEARED
730-360-0032 A CONDITION MORE ABJECT THAN THAT
730-360-0033 OR EVEN WHY THERE WERE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS BUT WHEN I HEARD DETAILS OF VICE AND BLOODSHED MY WONDER CEASED AND I TURNED AWAY WITH DISGUST AND LOATHING EVERY CONVERSATION OF THE COTTAGERS NOW OPENED NEW WONDERS TO ME
730-360-0034 I HEARD OF THE DIVISION OF PROPERTY OF IMMENSE WEALTH AND SQUALID POVERTY OF RANK DESCENT AND NOBLE BLOOD
730-360-0035 UNITED WITH RICHES A MAN MIGHT BE RESPECTED WITH ONLY ONE OF THESE ADVANTAGES BUT WITHOUT EITHER HE WAS CONSIDERED EXCEPT IN VERY RARE INSTANCES AS A VAGABOND AND A SLAVE DOOMED TO WASTE HIS POWERS FOR THE PROFITS OF THE CHOSEN FEW
730-360-0036 AND WHAT WAS I OF MY CREATION AND CREATOR I WAS ABSOLUTELY IGNORANT BUT I KNEW THAT I POSSESSED NO MONEY NO FRIENDS NO KIND OF PROPERTY
730-360-0037 SENSATIONS OF HUNGER THIRST AND HEAT OF WHAT A STRANGE NATURE IS KNOWLEDGE
730-360-0038 AND THAT WAS DEATH A STATE WHICH I FEARED YET DID NOT UNDERSTAND
730-360-0039 EXCEPT THROUGH MEANS WHICH I OBTAINED BY STEALTH
730-360-0040 MISERABLE UNHAPPY WRETCH OTHER LESSONS WERE IMPRESSED UPON ME EVEN MORE DEEPLY
730-360-0041 HOW THE FATHER DOTED ON THE SMILES OF THE INFANT
730-360-0042 NO MOTHER HAD BLESSED ME WITH SMILES AND CARESSES
730-360-0043 ALL MY PAST LIFE WAS NOW A BLOT A BLIND VACANCY IN WHICH I DISTINGUISHED NOTHING FROM MY EARLIEST REMEMBRANCE I HAD BEEN AS I THEN WAS IN HEIGHT AND PROPORTION
730-360-0044 I HAD NEVER YET SEEN A BEING RESEMBLING ME OR WHO CLAIMED ANY INTERCOURSE WITH ME WHAT WAS I
7302-86814-0000 IN THEIR EXPRESSIVE LANGUAGE HAVE NAMED IT THE LIONS DEN PROBABLY BECAUSE THE CAPTIVES POSSESS TEETH WHICH FREQUENTLY GNAW THE BARS AND SOMETIMES THE KEEPERS ALSO IT IS A PRISON WITHIN A PRISON
7302-86814-0001 THE WALLS ARE DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE REST THE GRATINGS ARE EVERY DAY CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY JAILERS WHOSE HERCULEAN PROPORTIONS AND COLD PITILESS EXPRESSION
7302-86814-0002 PROVE THEM TO HAVE BEEN CHOSEN TO REIGN OVER THEIR SUBJECTS FOR THEIR SUPERIOR ACTIVITY AND INTELLIGENCE THE COURT YARD OF THIS QUARTER IS ENCLOSED BY ENORMOUS WALLS OVER WHICH THE SUN GLANCES OBLIQUELY
7302-86814-0003 WHEN IT DEIGNS TO PENETRATE INTO THIS GULF OF MORAL AND PHYSICAL DEFORMITY ON THIS PAVED YARD ARE TO BE SEEN PACING TO AND FRO FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT PALE CAREWORN AND HAGGARD LIKE SO MANY SHADOWS

7302-86814-0005 WATCHING THE DOOR WHICH SOMETIMES OPENS TO CALL FORTH ONE FROM THE GLOOMY ASSEMBLAGE OR TO THROW IN ANOTHER OUTCAST FROM SOCIETY THE COURT OF SAINT BERNARD HAS ITS OWN PARTICULAR APARTMENT
7302-86814-0006 IT IS A WRETCHED DAMP NAY EVEN HORRIBLE SPOT MORE ESPECIALLY WHEN WE CONSIDER THE AGONIZING CONFERENCES WHICH HAVE TAKEN PLACE BETWEEN THOSE IRON BARS AND YET FRIGHTFUL THOUGH THIS SPOT MAY BE
7302-86814-0007 IT IS LOOKED UPON AS A KIND OF PARADISE BY THE MEN WHOSE DAYS ARE NUMBERED IT IS SO RARE FOR THEM TO LEAVE THE LIONS DEN FOR ANY OTHER PLACE THAN THE BARRIER SAINT JACQUES OR THE GALLEYS

7302-86814-0015 THE LATTER SURE OF QUELLING THE TEMPEST WHEN THE WAVES BECAME TOO VIOLENT ALLOWED THEM TO RISE TO A CERTAIN PITCH THAT HE MIGHT BE REVENGED ON THE IMPORTUNATE ANDREA AND BESIDES IT WOULD AFFORD HIM SOME RECREATION DURING THE LONG DAY
7302-86814-0016 THE THIEVES HAD ALREADY APPROACHED ANDREA SOME SCREAMING
7302-86814-0017 ANOTHER KIND OF RECREATION IN WHICH A HANDKERCHIEF IS FILLED WITH SAND PEBBLES

7302-86815-0001 HAD NOT SEEN HIS FATHER SINCE THE MORNING OF THE DEATH THE WHOLE ESTABLISHMENT HAD BEEN CHANGED ANOTHER VALET WAS ENGAGED FOR HIMSELF
7302-86815-0002 TWO WOMEN HAD ENTERED MADAME DE VILLEFORT'S SERVICE IN FACT EVERYWHERE TO THE CONCIERGE AND COACHMEN NEW FACES WERE PRESENTED TO THE DIFFERENT MASTERS OF THE HOUSE
7302-86815-0003 THE PROOFS WERE CERTAINLY NOT CONVINCING SINCE THEY RESTED UPON A FEW WORDS WRITTEN BY AN ESCAPED GALLEY SLAVE ON HIS DEATH BED AND WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN ACTUATED BY HATRED OR REVENGE
7302-86815-0004 IN ACCUSING HIS COMPANION BUT THE MIND OF THE PROCUREUR WAS MADE UP HE FELT ASSURED THAT BENEDETTO WAS GUILTY AND HE HOPED BY HIS SKILL IN CONDUCTING THIS AGGRAVATED CASE TO FLATTER HIS SELF LOVE
7302-86815-0005 WHICH WAS ABOUT THE ONLY VULNERABLE POINT LEFT IN HIS FROZEN HEART THE CASE WAS THEREFORE PREPARED OWING TO THE INCESSANT LABOR
7302-86815-0006 WHO WISHED IT TO BE THE FIRST ON THE LIST IN THE COMING ASSIZES HE HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO SECLUDE HIMSELF MORE THAN EVER TO EVADE THE ENORMOUS NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS
7302-86815-0007 PRESENTED TO HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING TICKETS OF ADMISSION TO THE COURT ON THE DAY OF TRIAL
7302-86815-0008 AND THE GLOOM WHICH OVERSHADOWED THE HOUSE WAS SO RECENT
7302-86815-0009 WHICH WERE THE ONLY MEANS HE HAD OF DISSIPATING HIS GRIEF ONCE ONLY HAD VILLEFORT SEEN HIS FATHER
7302-86815-0010 WHEN THE LATTER WAS TO LEARN HIS FATHER'S NAME THE MAGISTRATE HARASSED AND FATIGUED
7302-86815-0011 SIMILAR TO THAT IN WHICH TARQUIN LOPPED OFF THE TALLEST POPPIES HE BEGAN KNOCKING OFF WITH HIS CANE THE LONG AND DYING BRANCHES OF THE ROSE TREES WHICH PLACED ALONG THE AVENUE
7302-86815-0012 AT ONE OF THE OPEN WINDOWS
7302-86815-0013 WHICH VILLEFORT COULD SCARCELY DISTINGUISH HIS GLANCE WAS SO FULL OF HATE OF FEROCITY AND SAVAGE IMPATIENCE
7302-86815-0014 TO SEE UPON WHAT PERSON THIS DARK LOOK WAS DIRECTED THEN HE SAW BENEATH A THICK CLUMP OF LINDEN TREES WHICH WERE NEARLY DIVESTED OF FOLIAGE MADAME DE VILLEFORT SITTING WITH A BOOK IN HER HAND
7302-86815-0015 TO SMILE UPON HER SON OR TO THROW BACK HIS ELASTIC BALL WHICH HE OBSTINATELY THREW FROM THE DRAWING ROOM INTO THE GARDEN
7302-86815-0016 HOWEVER AT LENGTH HE DECIDED LEAPED OUT OF THE WINDOW INTO A CLUSTER OF HELIOTROPES AND DAISIES AND RAN TO HIS MOTHER HIS FOREHEAD STREAMING WITH PERSPIRATION
7302-86815-0017 PRESSED HER LIPS UPON IT AND SENT HIM BACK WITH THE BALL IN ONE HAND AND SOME BONBONS IN THE OTHER
7302-86815-0018 LIKE THAT OF THE BIRD TO THE SERPENT WALKED TOWARDS THE HOUSE AS HE APPROACHED IT
7302-86815-0019 FELT THEM PIERCE TO THE DEPTHS OF HIS HEART IN THAT EARNEST LOOK
7302-86815-0020 AS WELL AS A TERRIBLE MENACE THEN NOIRTIER RAISED HIS EYES TO HEAVEN
7302-86815-0021 IT IS WELL SIR REPLIED VILLEFORT FROM BELOW IT IS WELL HAVE PATIENCE BUT ONE DAY LONGER WHAT I HAVE SAID I WILL DO NOIRTIER SEEMED TO BE CALMED BY THESE WORDS
7302-86815-0022 AND TURNED HIS EYES WITH INDIFFERENCE TO THE OTHER SIDE
7302-86815-0023 WHICH SEEMED TO STRANGLE HIM AND PASSING HIS LIVID HAND ACROSS HIS FOREHEAD ENTERED HIS STUDY THE NIGHT WAS COLD AND STILL THE FAMILY HAD ALL RETIRED TO REST BUT VILLEFORT WHO ALONE REMAINED UP

7302-86815-0025 WHICH STOOD OUT IN BLACK RELIEF ON THE HORIZON IN THE CLOVER FIELDS BEYOND THE CHESTNUT TREES A LARK WAS MOUNTING UP TO HEAVEN WHILE POURING OUT HER CLEAR MORNING SONG
7302-86815-0026 AND REFRESHED HIS MEMORY TO DAY HE SAID WITH AN EFFORT TO DAY THE MAN WHO HOLDS THE BLADE OF JUSTICE MUST STRIKE WHEREVER THERE IS GUILT INVOLUNTARILY HIS EYES WANDERED TOWARDS THE WINDOW
7302-86815-0027 OF NOIRTIER'S ROOM WHERE HE HAD SEEN HIM THE PRECEDING NIGHT THE CURTAIN WAS DRAWN AND YET THE IMAGE OF HIS FATHER WAS SO VIVID TO HIS MIND THAT HE ADDRESSED THE CLOSED WINDOW AS THOUGH IT HAD BEEN OPEN
7302-86815-0028 AND AS IF THROUGH THE OPENING HE HAD BEHELD THE MENACING OLD MAN YES HE MURMURED YES BE SATISFIED HIS HEAD DROPPED UPON HIS CHEST AND IN THIS POSITION HE PACED HIS STUDY
7302-86815-0029 THEN HE THREW HIMSELF DRESSED AS HE WAS UPON A SOFA LESS TO SLEEP THAN TO REST HIS LIMBS CRAMPED WITH COLD AND STUDY BY DEGREES EVERY ONE AWOKE
7302-86815-0030 HEARD THE SUCCESSIVE NOISES WHICH ACCOMPANY THE LIFE OF A HOUSE THE OPENING AND SHUTTING OF DOORS

7367-86737-0042 YOUR ANSWER IS SUBLIME AND WORTHY THE LET HIM DIE OF CORNEILLE ONLY WHEN HORACE MADE THAT ANSWER THE SAFETY OF ROME WAS CONCERNED
7367-86737-0043 ALBERT POURED HIMSELF OUT A GLASS OF LACRYMA CHRISTI WHICH HE SIPPED AT INTERVALS MUTTERING SOME UNINTELLIGIBLE WORDS WELL SIGNOR PASTRINI SAID FRANZ NOW THAT MY COMPANION IS QUIETED AND YOU HAVE SEEN HOW PEACEFUL MY INTENTIONS ARE
7367-86737-0044 TELL ME WHO IS THIS LUIGI VAMPA IS HE A SHEPHERD OR A NOBLEMAN YOUNG OR OLD TALL OR SHORT DESCRIBE HIM IN ORDER THAT IF WE MEET HIM BY CHANCE LIKE BUGABOO JOHN OR LARA WE MAY RECOGNIZE HIM
7367-86737-0045 YOU COULD NOT APPLY TO ANY ONE BETTER ABLE TO INFORM YOU ON ALL THESE POINTS FOR I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS A CHILD AND ONE DAY THAT I FELL INTO HIS HANDS GOING FROM FERENTINO TO ALATRI HE FORTUNATELY FOR ME
7367-86737-0046 RECOLLECTED ME AND SET ME FREE NOT ONLY WITHOUT RANSOM BUT MADE ME A PRESENT OF A VERY SPLENDID WATCH AND RELATED HIS HISTORY TO ME LET US SEE THE WATCH SAID ALBERT
7367-86737-0047 BEARING THE NAME OF ITS MAKER OF PARISIAN MANUFACTURE AND A COUNT'S CORONET HERE IT IS SAID HE PESTE RETURNED ALBERT I COMPLIMENT YOU ON IT I HAVE ITS FELLOW HE TOOK HIS WATCH FROM HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET
7367-86737-0048 AND IT COST ME THREE THOUSAND FRANCS LET US HEAR THE HISTORY SAID FRANZ MOTIONING SIGNOR PASTRINI TO SEAT HIMSELF
7367-86737-0049 AT THE MOMENT SIGNOR PASTRINI WAS ABOUT TO OPEN HIS MOUTH THAT YOU KNEW LUIGI VAMPA WHEN HE WAS A CHILD
7367-86737-0050 A YOUNG MAN HE IS ONLY TWO AND TWENTY HE WILL GAIN HIMSELF A REPUTATION WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT ALBERT AT TWO AND TWENTY TO BE THUS FAMOUS YES AND AT HIS AGE ALEXANDER CAESAR AND NAPOLEON
7367-86737-0051 HE WAS BORN AT PAMPINARA AND ENTERED THE COUNT'S SERVICE WHEN HE WAS FIVE YEARS OLD HIS FATHER WAS ALSO A SHEPHERD WHO OWNED A SMALL FLOCK AND LIVED BY THE WOOL AND THE MILK WHICH HE SOLD AT ROME WHEN QUITE A CHILD THE LITTLE VAMPA DISPLAYED A MOST EXTRAORDINARY PRECOCITY
7367-86737-0052 ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SEVEN YEARS OLD HE CAME TO THE CURATE OF PALESTRINA AND ASKED TO BE TAUGHT TO READ IT WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFICULT FOR HE COULD NOT QUIT HIS FLOCK BUT THE GOOD CURATE WENT EVERY DAY TO SAY MASS AT A LITTLE HAMLET TOO POOR TO PAY A PRIEST AND WHICH
7367-86737-0053 EVERY DAY LUIGI LED HIS FLOCK TO GRAZE ON THE ROAD THAT LEADS FROM PALESTRINA TO BORGO EVERY DAY AT NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING THE PRIEST AND THE BOY SAT DOWN ON A BANK BY THE WAYSIDE
7367-86737-0054 AT THE END OF A WEEK HE WROTE AS WELL WITH THIS PEN AS WITH THE STYLUS THE CURATE RELATED THE INCIDENT TO THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE WHO SENT FOR THE LITTLE SHEPHERD MADE HIM READ AND WRITE BEFORE HIM ORDERED HIS ATTENDANT TO LET HIM EAT WITH THE DOMESTICS AND TO GIVE HIM TWO PIASTRES A MONTH
7367-86737-0055 WITH THIS LUIGI PURCHASED BOOKS AND PENCILS HE APPLIED HIS IMITATIVE POWERS TO EVERYTHING AND LIKE GIOTTO WHEN YOUNG HE DREW ON HIS SLATE SHEEP HOUSES AND TREES
7367-86737-0056 IT WAS THUS THAT PINELLI THE FAMOUS SCULPTOR HAD COMMENCED A GIRL OF SIX OR SEVEN THAT IS A LITTLE YOUNGER THAN VAMPA TENDED SHEEP ON A FARM NEAR PALESTRINA SHE WAS AN ORPHAN BORN AT VALMONTONE AND WAS NAMED TERESA THE TWO CHILDREN MET
7367-86737-0057 HAD BEEN ABLE TO GAIN ANY INFLUENCE OVER HIM OR EVEN TO BECOME HIS COMPANION HIS DISPOSITION ALWAYS INCLINED TO EXACT CONCESSIONS RATHER THAN TO MAKE THEM KEPT HIM ALOOF FROM ALL FRIENDSHIPS TERESA ALONE RULED BY A LOOK
7367-86737-0058 THE TWO PIASTRES THAT LUIGI RECEIVED EVERY MONTH FROM THE COUNT OF SAN FELICE'S STEWARD AND THE PRICE OF ALL THE LITTLE CARVINGS IN WOOD HE SOLD AT ROME WERE EXPENDED IN EAR RINGS NECKLACES AND GOLD HAIRPINS SO THAT THANKS TO HER FRIEND'S GENEROSITY
7367-86737-0059 TERESA WAS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND THE BEST ATTIRED PEASANT NEAR ROME THE TWO CHILDREN GREW UP TOGETHER PASSING ALL THEIR TIME WITH EACH OTHER AND GIVING THEMSELVES UP TO THE WILD IDEAS OF THEIR DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
7367-86737-0060 THUS IN ALL THEIR DREAMS THEIR WISHES AND THEIR CONVERSATIONS VAMPA SAW HIMSELF THE CAPTAIN OF A VESSEL GENERAL OF AN ARMY OR GOVERNOR OF A PROVINCE TERESA SAW HERSELF RICH SUPERBLY ATTIRED
7367-86737-0061 AND ATTENDED BY A TRAIN OF LIVERIED DOMESTICS THEN WHEN THEY HAD THUS PASSED THE DAY IN BUILDING CASTLES IN THE AIR THEY SEPARATED THEIR FLOCKS AND DESCENDED FROM THE ELEVATION OF THEIR DREAMS TO THE REALITY OF THEIR HUMBLE POSITION
7367-86737-0062 AND PROWL AROUND HIS FLOCK THE STEWARD GAVE HIM A GUN THIS WAS WHAT VAMPA LONGED FOR THIS GUN HAD AN EXCELLENT BARREL MADE AT BRESCHIA AND CARRYING A BALL WITH THE PRECISION OF AN ENGLISH RIFLE BUT ONE DAY THE COUNT BROKE THE STOCK
7367-86737-0063 AND HAD THEN CAST THE GUN ASIDE THIS HOWEVER WAS NOTHING TO A SCULPTOR LIKE VAMPA HE EXAMINED THE BROKEN STOCK CALCULATED WHAT CHANGE IT WOULD REQUIRE TO ADAPT THE GUN TO HIS SHOULDER AND MADE A FRESH STOCK
7367-86737-0064 SO BEAUTIFULLY CARVED THAT IT WOULD HAVE FETCHED FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PIASTRES HAD HE CHOSEN TO SELL IT BUT NOTHING COULD BE FARTHER FROM HIS THOUGHTS FOR A LONG TIME A GUN HAD BEEN THE YOUNG MAN'S GREATEST AMBITION IN EVERY COUNTRY WHERE INDEPENDENCE HAS TAKEN THE PLACE OF LIBERTY
7367-86737-0065 THE FIRST DESIRE OF A MANLY HEART IS TO POSSESS A WEAPON WHICH AT ONCE RENDERS HIM CAPABLE OF DEFENCE OR ATTACK AND BY RENDERING ITS OWNER TERRIBLE OFTEN MAKES HIM FEARED FROM THIS MOMENT VAMPA DEVOTED ALL HIS LEISURE TIME TO PERFECTING HIMSELF IN THE USE OF HIS PRECIOUS WEAPON
7367-86737-0066 HE PURCHASED POWDER AND BALL AND EVERYTHING SERVED HIM FOR A MARK THE TRUNK OF SOME OLD AND MOSS GROWN OLIVETREE THAT GREW ON THE SABINE MOUNTAINS THE FOX AS HE QUITTED HIS EARTH ON SOME MARAUDING EXCURSION THE EAGLE THAT SOARED ABOVE THEIR HEADS
7367-86737-0067 AND THUS HE SOON BECAME SO EXPERT THAT TERESA OVERCAME THE TERROR SHE AT FIRST FELT AT THE REPORT AND AMUSED HERSELF BY WATCHING HIM DIRECT THE BALL WHEREVER HE PLEASED WITH AS MUCH ACCURACY AS IF HE PLACED IT BY HAND
7367-86737-0068 ONE EVENING A WOLF EMERGED FROM A PINE WOOD HEAR WHICH THEY WERE USUALLY STATIONED BUT THE WOLF HAD SCARCELY ADVANCED TEN YARDS ERE HE WAS DEAD PROUD OF THIS EXPLOIT VAMPA TOOK THE DEAD ANIMAL ON HIS SHOULDERS AND CARRIED HIM TO THE FARM
7367-86737-0069 THESE EXPLOITS HAD GAINED LUIGI CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION THE MAN OF SUPERIOR ABILITIES ALWAYS FINDS ADMIRERS GO WHERE HE WILL HE WAS SPOKEN OF AS THE MOST ADROIT THE STRONGEST AND THE MOST COURAGEOUS CONTADINO FOR TEN LEAGUES AROUND
7367-86737-0070 AND ALTHOUGH TERESA WAS UNIVERSALLY ALLOWED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL OF THE SABINES NO ONE HAD EVER SPOKEN TO HER OF LOVE BECAUSE IT WAS KNOWN THAT SHE WAS BELOVED BY VAMPA AND YET THE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE HAD NEVER DECLARED THEIR AFFECTION
7367-86737-0071 THEY HAD GROWN TOGETHER LIKE TWO TREES WHOSE ROOTS ARE MINGLED WHOSE BRANCHES INTERTWINED AND WHOSE INTERMINGLED PERFUME RISES TO THE HEAVENS ONLY THEIR WISH TO SEE EACH OTHER HAD BECOME A NECESSITY AND THEY WOULD HAVE PREFERRED DEATH TO A DAY'S SEPARATION
7367-86737-0072 TERESA WAS SIXTEEN AND VAMPA SEVENTEEN
7367-86737-0073 THE BRIGANDS HAVE NEVER BEEN REALLY EXTIRPATED FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ROME SOMETIMES A CHIEF IS WANTED BUT WHEN A CHIEF PRESENTS HIMSELF HE RARELY HAS TO WAIT LONG FOR A BAND OF FOLLOWERS THE CELEBRATED CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0074 DRIVEN OUT OF THE KINGDOM OF NAPLES WHERE HE HAD CARRIED ON A REGULAR WAR HAD CROSSED THE GARIGLIANO LIKE MANFRED AND HAD TAKEN REFUGE ON THE BANKS OF THE AMASINE BETWEEN SONNINO AND JUPERNO
7367-86737-0075 HE STROVE TO COLLECT A BAND OF FOLLOWERS AND FOLLOWED THE FOOTSTEPS OF DECESARIS AND GASPERONE WHOM HE HOPED TO SURPASS MANY YOUNG MEN OF PALESTRINA FRASCATI AND PAMPINARA HAD DISAPPEARED
7367-86737-0076 THEIR DISAPPEARANCE AT FIRST CAUSED MUCH DISQUIETUDE BUT IT WAS SOON KNOWN THAT THEY HAD JOINED CUCUMETTO AFTER SOME TIME CUCUMETTO BECAME THE OBJECT OF UNIVERSAL ATTENTION
7367-86737-0077 THE MOST EXTRAORDINARY TRAITS OF FEROCIOUS DARING AND BRUTALITY WERE RELATED OF HIM ONE DAY HE CARRIED OFF A YOUNG GIRL THE DAUGHTER OF A SURVEYOR OF FROSINONE THE BANDIT'S LAWS ARE POSITIVE A YOUNG GIRL BELONGS FIRST TO HIM WHO CARRIES HER OFF
7367-86737-0078 THEN THE REST DRAW LOTS FOR HER AND SHE IS ABANDONED TO THEIR BRUTALITY UNTIL DEATH RELIEVES HER SUFFERINGS WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE SUFFICIENTLY RICH TO PAY A RANSOM A MESSENGER IS SENT TO NEGOTIATE THE PRISONER IS HOSTAGE FOR THE SECURITY OF THE MESSENGER
7367-86737-0079 WHEN SHE RECOGNIZED HER LOVER THE POOR GIRL EXTENDED HER ARMS TO HIM AND BELIEVED HERSELF SAFE BUT CARLINI FELT HIS HEART SINK FOR HE BUT TOO WELL KNEW THE FATE THAT AWAITED HER HOWEVER AS HE WAS A FAVORITE WITH CUCUMETTO
7367-86737-0080 AS HE HAD FOR THREE YEARS FAITHFULLY SERVED HIM AND AS HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE BY SHOOTING A DRAGOON WHO WAS ABOUT TO CUT HIM DOWN HE HOPED THE CHIEF WOULD HAVE PITY ON HIM HE TOOK CUCUMETTO ONE SIDE
7367-86737-0081 WHILE THE YOUNG GIRL SEATED AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE PINE THAT STOOD IN THE CENTRE OF THE FOREST MADE A VEIL OF HER PICTURESQUE HEAD DRESS TO HIDE HER FACE FROM THE LASCIVIOUS GAZE OF THE BANDITS THERE HE TOLD THE CHIEF ALL HIS AFFECTION FOR THE PRISONER
7367-86737-0082 THEIR PROMISES OF MUTUAL FIDELITY AND HOW EVERY NIGHT SINCE HE HAD BEEN NEAR THEY HAD MET IN SOME NEIGHBORING RUINS
7367-86737-0083 CUCUMETTO SEEMED TO YIELD TO HIS FRIEND'S ENTREATIES AND BADE HIM FIND A SHEPHERD TO SEND TO RITA'S FATHER AT FROSINONE CARLINI FLEW JOYFULLY TO RITA TELLING HER SHE WAS SAVED AND BIDDING HER WRITE TO HER FATHER TO INFORM HIM WHAT HAD OCCURRED
7367-86737-0084 AND THAT HER RANSOM WAS FIXED AT THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES TWELVE HOURS DELAY WAS ALL THAT WAS GRANTED THAT IS UNTIL NINE THE NEXT MORNING THE INSTANT THE LETTER WAS WRITTEN CARLINI SEIZED IT AND HASTENED TO THE PLAIN TO FIND A MESSENGER
7367-86737-0085 HE FOUND A YOUNG SHEPHERD WATCHING HIS FLOCK THE NATURAL MESSENGERS OF THE BANDITS ARE THE SHEPHERDS WHO LIVE BETWEEN THE CITY AND THE MOUNTAINS BETWEEN CIVILIZED AND SAVAGE LIFE THE BOY UNDERTOOK THE COMMISSION PROMISING TO BE IN FROSINONE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR
7367-86737-0086 CARLINI RETURNED ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS MISTRESS AND ANNOUNCE THE JOYFUL INTELLIGENCE HE FOUND THE TROOP IN THE GLADE SUPPING OFF THE PROVISIONS EXACTED AS CONTRIBUTIONS FROM THE PEASANTS BUT HIS EYE VAINLY SOUGHT RITA AND CUCUMETTO AMONG THEM
7367-86737-0087 SAYING TO THE HEALTH OF THE BRAVE CUCUMETTO AND THE FAIR RITA AT THIS MOMENT CARLINI HEARD A WOMAN'S CRY HE DIVINED THE TRUTH SEIZED THE GLASS BROKE IT ACROSS THE FACE OF HIM WHO PRESENTED IT AND RUSHED TOWARDS THE SPOT
7367-86737-0088 WHENCE THE CRY CAME AFTER A HUNDRED YARDS HE TURNED THE CORNER OF THE THICKET HE FOUND RITA SENSELESS IN THE ARMS OF CUCUMETTO AT THE SIGHT OF CARLINI CUCUMETTO ROSE A PISTOL IN EACH HAND THE TWO BRIGANDS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR A MOMENT
7367-86737-0089 THE ONE WITH A SMILE OF LASCIVIOUSNESS ON HIS LIPS THE OTHER WITH THE PALLOR OF DEATH ON HIS BROW A TERRIBLE BATTLE BETWEEN THE TWO MEN SEEMED IMMINENT BUT BY DEGREES CARLINI'S FEATURES RELAXED HIS HAND WHICH HAD GRASPED ONE OF THE PISTOLS IN HIS BELT
7367-86737-0090 THIS YOUNG GIRL IS CHARMING AND DOES CREDIT TO YOUR TASTE NOW AS I AM NOT EGOTISTICAL WE WILL RETURN TO OUR COMRADES AND DRAW LOTS FOR HER HAVE DETERMINED THEN TO ABANDON HER TO THE COMMON LAW SAID CARLINI
7367-86737-0091 WHY SHOULD AN EXCEPTION BE MADE IN HER FAVOR I THOUGHT THAT MY ENTREATIES' WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU ANY MORE THAN THE REST TO ASK FOR AN EXCEPTION IS TRUE
7367-86737-0092 CONTINUED CUCUMETTO LAUGHING SOONER OR LATER YOUR TURN WILL COME CARLINI'S TEETH CLINCHED CONVULSIVELY NOW THEN SAID CUCUMETTO ADVANCING TOWARDS THE OTHER BANDITS ARE YOU COMING
7367-86737-0093 HE CONTINUED TO FOLLOW THE PATH TO THE GLADE BUT TO HIS GREAT SURPRISE CARLINI ARRIVED ALMOST AS SOON AS HIMSELF LET US DRAW LOTS LET US DRAW LOTS CRIED ALL THE BRIGANDS WHEN THEY SAW THE CHIEF
7367-86737-0094 THEIR DEMAND WAS FAIR AND THE CHIEF INCLINED HIS HEAD IN SIGN OF ACQUIESCENCE THE EYES OF ALL SHONE FIERCELY AS THEY MADE THEIR DEMAND AND THE RED LIGHT OF THE FIRE MADE THEM LOOK LIKE DEMONS THE NAMES OF ALL INCLUDING CARLINI WERE PLACED IN A HAT
7367-86737-0095 AND THE YOUNGEST OF THE BAND DREW FORTH A TICKET THE TICKET BORE THE NAME OF DIOVOLACCIO HE WAS THE MAN WHO HAD PROPOSED TO CARLINI THE HEALTH OF THEIR CHIEF
7367-86737-0096 AND TO WHOM CARLINI REPLIED BY BREAKING THE GLASS ACROSS HIS FACE A LARGE WOUND EXTENDING FROM THE TEMPLE TO THE MOUTH WAS BLEEDING PROFUSELY DIOVALACCIO SEEING HIMSELF THUS FAVORED BY FORTUNE BURST INTO A LOUD LAUGH CAPTAIN
7367-86737-0097 DIAVOLACCIO SAID HE CALMLY AND HE DRANK IT OFF WITHOUT HIS HAND TREMBLING IN THE LEAST THEN SITTING DOWN BY THE FIRE MY SUPPER SAID HE MY EXPEDITION HAS GIVEN ME AN APPETITE
7367-86737-0098 THAT IS ACTING LIKE A GOOD FELLOW AND THEY ALL FORMED A CIRCLE ROUND THE FIRE
7367-86737-0099 CARLINI ATE AND DRANK AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED THE BANDITS LOOKED ON WITH ASTONISHMENT AT THIS SINGULAR CONDUCT UNTIL THEY HEARD FOOTSTEPS THEY TURNED ROUND
7367-86737-0100 THAT EVERY ONE ROSE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CARLINI WHO REMAINED SEATED AND ATE AND DRANK CALMLY DIAVOLACCIO ADVANCED AMIDST THE MOST PROFOUND SILENCE AND LAID RITA AT THE CAPTAIN'S FEET
7367-86737-0101 I NOW UNDERSTAND WHY CARLINI STAYED BEHIND ALL SAVAGE NATURES APPRECIATE A DESPERATE DEED NO OTHER OF THE BANDITS WOULD PERHAPS HAVE DONE THE SAME BUT THEY ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT CARLINI HAD DONE NOW THEN CRIED CARLINI
7367-86737-0102 RISING IN HIS TURN AND APPROACHING THE CORPSE HIS HAND ON THE BUTT OF ONE OF HIS PISTOLS DOES ANY ONE DISPUTE THE POSSESSION OF THIS WOMAN WITH ME
7367-86737-0103 RETURNED THE CHIEF SHE IS THINE CARLINI RAISED HER IN HIS ARMS AND CARRIED HER OUT OF THE CIRCLE OF FIRELIGHT CUCUMETTO PLACED HIS SENTINELS FOR THE NIGHT AND THE BANDITS WRAPPED THEMSELVES IN THEIR CLOAKS AND LAY DOWN BEFORE THE FIRE
7367-86737-0104 AT MIDNIGHT THE SENTINEL GAVE THE ALARM AND IN AN INSTANT ALL WERE ON THE ALERT IT WAS RITA'S FATHER WHO BROUGHT HIS DAUGHTER'S RANSOM IN PERSON HERE SAID HE TO CUCUMETTO HERE ARE THREE HUNDRED PIASTRES GIVE ME BACK MY CHILD
7367-86737-0105 BUT THE CHIEF WITHOUT TAKING THE MONEY
7367-86737-0106 THE OLD MAN OBEYED THEY BOTH ADVANCED BENEATH THE TREES THROUGH WHOSE BRANCHES STREAMED THE MOONLIGHT CUCUMETTO STOPPED AT LAST AND POINTED TO TWO PERSONS GROUPED AT THE FOOT OF A TREE THERE SAID HE DEMAND THY CHILD OF CARLINI
7367-86737-0107 HE WILL TELL THEE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HER AND HE RETURNED TO HIS COMPANIONS THE OLD MAN REMAINED MOTIONLESS HE FELT THAT SOME GREAT AND UNFORESEEN MISFORTUNE HUNG OVER HIS HEAD AT LENGTH HE ADVANCED TOWARD THE GROUP THE MEANING OF WHICH HE COULD NOT COMPREHEND
7367-86737-0108 AS HE APPROACHED CARLINI RAISED HIS HEAD AND THE FORMS OF TWO PERSONS BECAME VISIBLE TO THE OLD MAN'S EYES A WOMAN LAY ON THE GROUND HER HEAD RESTING ON THE KNEES OF A MAN WHO WAS SEATED BY HER AS HE RAISED HIS HEAD
7367-86737-0109 THE WOMAN'S FACE BECAME VISIBLE THE OLD MAN RECOGNIZED HIS CHILD AND CARLINI RECOGNIZED THE OLD MAN I EXPECTED THEE SAID THE BANDIT TO RITA'S FATHER
7367-86737-0110 I LOVED HER THEREFORE I SLEW HER FOR SHE WOULD HAVE SERVED AS THE SPORT OF THE WHOLE BAND THE OLD MAN SPOKE NOT AND GREW PALE AS DEATH NOW CONTINUED CARLINI IF I HAVE DONE WRONGLY AVENGE HER
7367-86737-0111 AND WITHDRAWING THE KNIFE FROM THE WOUND IN RITA'S BOSOM HE HELD IT OUT TO THE OLD MAN WITH ONE HAND WHILE WITH THE OTHER HE TORE OPEN HIS VEST
7367-86737-0112 RETURNED THE OLD MAN IN A HOARSE VOICE EMBRACE ME MY SON CARLINI THREW HIMSELF SOBBING LIKE A CHILD INTO THE ARMS OF HIS MISTRESS'S FATHER THESE WERE THE FIRST TEARS THE MAN OF BLOOD HAD EVER WEPT NOW SAID THE OLD MAN
7367-86737-0113 AID ME TO BURY MY CHILD CARLINI FETCHED TWO PICKAXES AND THE FATHER AND THE LOVER BEGAN TO DIG AT THE FOOT OF A HUGE OAK BENEATH WHICH THE YOUNG GIRL WAS TO REPOSE WHEN THE GRAVE WAS FORMED THE FATHER KISSED HER FIRST AND THEN THE LOVER
7367-86737-0114 THEN EXTENDING HIS HAND THE OLD MAN SAID I THANK YOU MY SON AND NOW LEAVE ME ALONE
7367-86737-0115 I COMMAND YOU CARLINI OBEYED REJOINED HIS COMRADES FOLDED HIMSELF IN HIS CLOAK AND SOON APPEARED TO SLEEP AS SOUNDLY AS THE REST IT HAD BEEN RESOLVED THE NIGHT BEFORE TO CHANGE THEIR ENCAMPMENT
7367-86737-0116 AN HOUR BEFORE DAYBREAK CUCUMETTO AROUSED HIS MEN AND GAVE THE WORD TO MARCH BUT CARLINI WOULD NOT QUIT THE FOREST WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT HAD BECOME OF RITA'S FATHER HE WENT TOWARD THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
7367-86737-0117 HE FOUND THE OLD MAN SUSPENDED FROM ONE OF THE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHICH SHADED HIS DAUGHTER'S GRAVE HE THEN TOOK AN OATH OF BITTER VENGEANCE OVER THE DEAD BODY OF THE ONE AND THE TOMB OF THE OTHER
7367-86737-0118 HE SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED A BALL BETWEEN HIS SHOULDERS THAT ASTONISHMENT CEASED WHEN ONE OF THE BRIGANDS REMARKED TO HIS COMRADES THAT CUCUMETTO WAS STATIONED TEN PACES IN CARLINI'S REAR WHEN HE FELL ON THE MORNING OF THE DEPARTURE FROM THE FOREST OF FROSINONE
7402-59171-0000 MISTER SHAW CAME FOR A SHORT TIME RECENTLY TO BE REGARDED LESS AS AN AUTHOR THAN AS AN INCIDENT IN THE EUROPEAN WAR IN THE OPINION OF MANY PEOPLE IT SEEMED AS IF THE ALLIES WERE FIGHTING AGAINST A COMBINATION COMPOSED OF GERMANY
7402-59171-0001 AND HE DOES EXPRESS AN OPINION ON EVERYTHING WITHOUT MAKING A MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE SHAKE THEIR FISTS IN IMPOTENT ANGER HIS LIFE AT LEAST HIS PUBLIC LIFE
7402-59171-0002 HE HAS GONE ABOUT LIKE A PICKPOCKET OF ILLUSIONS FROM THE WORLD OF LITERATURE TO THE WORLD OF MORALS AND FROM THE WORLD OF MORALS TO THE WORLD OF POLITICS AND EVERYWHERE HE HAS GONE AN INNUMERABLE GROWL HAS FOLLOWED HIM
7402-59171-0003 NOT THAT HE HAS NOT HAD HIS DISCIPLES MEN AND WOMEN WHO BELIEVE THAT WHAT MISTER SHAW SAYS ON ANY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN WHAT THE TIMES OR THE MANCHESTER GUARDIAN SAYS HE HAS NEVER FOUNDED A CHURCH HOWEVER
7402-59171-0004 BECAUSE HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ABLE TO LAUGH AT HIS DISCIPLES AS UNFEELINGLY AS AT ANYBODY ELSE HE HAS COURTED UNPOPULARITY AS OTHER MEN HAVE COURTED POPULARITY HE HAS REFUSED TO ASSUME THE VACUOUS COUNTENANCE EITHER OF AN IDOL
7402-59171-0005 SEEMS LIKE LIFE IN RUINS ARE FILLED AT TIMES WITH A WILD LUST TO DENOUNCE AND BELITTLE HIM HE HAS BEEN CALLED MORE NAMES THAN ANY OTHER MAN OF LETTERS ALIVE
7402-59171-0006 WHEN ALL THE OTHER NAMES HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED AND WE ARE ABOUT TO BECOME INARTICULATE WE EVEN DENOUNCE HIM AS A BORE BUT THIS IS ONLY THE BILLINGSGATE OF OUR EXASPERATION MISTER SHAW IS NOT A BORE
7402-59171-0007 WHATEVER ELSE HE MAY BE HE HAS SUCCEEDED IN THE MERE BUSINESS OF INTERESTING US BEYOND ANY OTHER WRITER OF HIS TIME
7402-59171-0008 PROBABLY HE WAS DOOMED TO BE A FIGURE JUST AS DOCTOR JOHNSON WAS IF HE HAD NOT TOLD US LEGENDS ABOUT HIMSELF
7402-59171-0009 IN SEARCH OF A GHOST WITH ITS BEARD ON FIRE HIS CRITICS OFTEN ACCUSE HIM IN REGARD TO THE INVENTION OF THE SHAW MYTH OF HAVING DESIGNED A POSTER RATHER THAN PAINTED A PORTRAIT
7402-59171-0010 STOP ADVERTISING MYSELF ON THE CONTRARY I MUST DO IT MORE THAN EVER LOOK AT PEARS'S SOAP THERE IS A SOLID HOUSE IF YOU LIKE BUT EVERY WALL IS STILL PLASTERED WITH THEIR ADVERTISEMENTS IF I WERE TO GIVE UP ADVERTISING
7402-59171-0011 MY BUSINESS WOULD IMMEDIATELY BEGIN TO FALL OFF YOU BLAME ME FOR HAVING DECLARED MYSELF TO BE THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN OF MY TIME BUT THE CLAIM IS AN ARGUABLE ONE WHY SHOULD I NOT SAY IT WHEN I BELIEVE THAT IT IS TRUE
7402-59171-0012 HE IS IN THE LINE OF ALL THOSE TRAMPS AND STAGE IRISHMEN WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH LIFE WITH SO FINE A SWAGGER OF WORDS THIS ONLY MEANS THAT IN HIS LIFE HE IS AN ARTIST
7402-59171-0013 UNTIL WE REALIZE THAT HE IS AN ARTIST NOT ONLY IN THE INVENTION OF HIS OWN LIFE BUT IN THE OBSERVATION OF THE LIVES OF OTHER PEOPLE HIS BROADBENT IS AS WONDERFUL A FIGURE AS HIS GEORGE BERNARD SHAW NOT THAT HIS PORTRAITURE IS ALWAYS FAITHFUL
7402-59171-0014 HE SEES MEN AND WOMEN TOO FREQUENTLY IN THE REFRACTING SHALLOWS OF THEORIES HE IS A DOCTRINAIRE AND HIS CHARACTERS ARE OFTEN COMIC STATEMENTS OF HIS DOCTRINES RATHER THAN THE REFLECTIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN
7402-59171-0015 HE OBSERVES IN ONE OF THE MANY PASSAGES IN WHICH HE JUSTIFIES HIMSELF THE AUDIENCE THINKS IT IS BEING MADE FUN OF IN REALITY I AM SIMPLY A VERY CAREFUL WRITER OF NATURAL HISTORY
7402-59171-0016 ONE IS BOUND TO CONTRADICT HIM MISTER SHAW OFTEN THINKS HE IS PRESENTING TRUE HUMAN NATURE WHEN HE IS MERELY PRESENTING HIS OPINIONS ABOUT HUMAN NATURE THE HUMAN NATURE OF SOLDIERS OF ARTISTS OF WOMEN OR
7402-59171-0017 RATHER WHEN HE IS PRESENTING A QUEER FIZZING MIXTURE OF HUMAN NATURE AND HIS OPINIONS ABOUT IT THIS MAY BE SOMETIMES ACTUALLY A VIRTUE IN HIS COMEDY CERTAINLY FROM THE TIME OF ARISTOPHANES ONWARDS
7402-59171-0018 ADMIRABLY TRUE BOTH TO HUMAN NATURE AND TO MISTER SHAW'S VIEW OF THE HUMAN NATURE OF ARTISTS BUT WHEN HE GOES ON WITH HIS LAST BREATH TO UTTER HIS ARTISTIC CREED I BELIEVE IN MICHAEL ANGELO VELASQUEZ AND REMBRANDT IN THE MIGHT OF DESIGN
7402-59171-0019 THE REDEMPTION OF ALL THINGS BY BEAUTY EVERLASTING AND THE MESSAGE OF ART THAT HAS MADE THESE HANDS BLESSED AMEN AMEN THESE SENTENCES ARE NO MORE NATURAL OR NATURALISTIC
7402-59171-0020 WITHOUT ANY ADMIXTURE OF HUMANITY REPEATING MISTER SHAW'S OPINION OF THE NATURE OF THE CREED OF ARTISTS THERE IS A SIMILAR FALSIFICATION IN THE SAME PLAY IN THE CHARACTERIZATION OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN WHO IS PRESENT AT DUBEDAT'S DEATH
7402-59171-0021 BECAUSE INTO AN ATMOSPHERE OF MORE OR LESS NATURALISTIC COMEDY THEY SIMPLY INTRODUCE A FARCICAL EXAGGERATION OF MISTER SHAW'S OPINION OF THE INCOMPETENCE AND IMPUDENCE OF JOURNALISTS MISTER SHAW'S COMEDIES ARE REPEATEDLY INJURED
7402-59171-0022 BY A HURRIED ALTERATION OF ATMOSPHERE IN THIS MANNER COMEDY AS WELL AS TRAGEDY MUST CREATE SOME KIND OF ILLUSION AND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ILLUSION EVEN FOR THE SAKE OF A JOKE MAY MEAN THE DESTRUCTION OF LAUGHTER
7402-59171-0023 THE PROPORTION OF UNREALITY IS NOT OVERWHELMING IT HAS BEEN ENORMOUSLY EXAGGERATED AFTER ALL IF THE CHARACTER OF THE NEWSPAPER MAN IN THE DOCTOR'S DILEMMA IS MACHINE MADE
7402-59171-0024 THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT CHARACTER OF B B THE SOOTHING AND INCOMPETENT DOCTOR IS A CREATION OF THE TRUE COMIC GENIUS NINE PEOPLE OUT OF TEN HARP ON MISTER SHAW'S ERRORS
7402-59171-0025 IT IS MUCH MORE NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THAT AMID ALL HIS FALSIFICATIONS DOCTRINAL AND JOCULAR HE HAS A GENUINE COMIC SENSE OF CHARACTER MOST FRENCH CRITICS
7402-59171-0026 DECLARE THAT BERNARD SHAW DOES DEPICT CHARACTERS
7402-59171-0027 MOLIERE HAS NEVER DRAWN A DOCTOR MORE COMICALLY THE DOCTOR THAN PARAMORE NOR MORE CHARACTERISTIC FIGURES OF WOMEN THAN THOSE IN THE SAME PLAY THE PHILANDERER THE CHARACTER DRAWING IS ADMIRABLE
7402-59171-0028 AND THE CHARACTERIZATION IN MOLIERE IN SHAW'S PLAYS THE CHARACTERS ARE LESS REPRESENTATIVE OF VICES OR PASSIONS THAN THOSE OF MOLIERE AND MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF CLASS PROFESSION OR SECT
7402-59171-0029 MOLIERE DEPICTS THE MISER THE JEALOUS MAN THE MISANTHROPE THE HYPOCRITE WHEREAS SHAW DEPICTS THE BOURGEOIS THE REBEL THE CAPITALIST THE WORKMAN THE SOCIALIST THE DOCTOR
7402-59171-0030 A FEW ONLY OF THESE LATTER TYPES ARE GIVEN US BY MOLIERE
7402-59171-0031 OF FARCE AND SO FORTH IS A SUGGESTIVE CONTRIBUTION TO CRITICISM I AM NOT SURE THAT THE COMPARISON WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE EFFECTIVELY PUT IN A CHAPTER THAN A BOOK
7402-59171-0032 IS INTENDED AS A BIOGRAPHY AND GENERAL CRITICISM OF MISTER SHAW AS WELL AS A COMPARISON BETWEEN HIS WORK AND MOLIERE'S IT CONTAINS IT MUST BE CONFESSED A GREAT DEAL THAT IS NOT NEW TO ENGLISH READERS
7402-59171-0033 MISTER SHAW IS MADE AN IDOL IN SPITE OF HIMSELF
7402-59171-0034 IS AN OFFERING AT A SHRINE THE TRUE THINGS IT CONTAINS HOWEVER MAKE IT WORTH READING
7402-59171-0035 FOR INSTANCE WHAT MANY CRITICS HAVE FAILED TO SEE THAT IN HIS DRAMATIC WORK MISTER SHAW IS LESS A WIT THAN A HUMORIST IN SHAW'S WORK WE FIND FEW STUDIED JESTS FEW EPIGRAMS EVEN
7402-59171-0036 MOLIERE ANTICIPATED MISTER SHAW IN OUTRAGING THE SENTIMENT FOR INSTANCE WHICH HAS GATHERED ROUND THE FAMILY MOLIERE AND SHAW AS HE PUTS IT WITH QUAINT SERIOUSNESS APPEAR TO BE UNAWARE OF WHAT A FATHER IS WHAT A FATHER IS WORTH
7402-59171-0037 THE DEFENCE OF MISTER SHAW HOWEVER DOES NOT DEPEND ON ANY REAL OR IMAGINARY RESEMBLANCE OF HIS PLAYS TO MOLIERE'S HIS JOY AND HIS MISERY BEFORE THE LUDICROUS SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE ARE HIS OWN AND HIS EXPRESSION OF THEM
7402-59171-0038 IS HIS OWN HE HAS STUDIED WITH HIS OWN EYES THE SWOLLEN BELLIED PRETENCES OF PREACHERS AND POETS AND RICH MEN AND LOVERS AND POLITICIANS AND HE HAS DERIDED THEM AS THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN DERIDED ON THE ENGLISH STAGE BEFORE
7402-59171-0039 HE HAS DERIDED THEM WITH BOTH AN ARTISTIC AND A MORAL ENERGY HE HAS BROUGHT THEM ALL INTO A PALACE OF TRUTH WHERE THEY HAVE REVEALED THEMSELVES WITH AN UNACCUSTOMED AND STARTLING FRANKNESS
7402-59171-0040 HE HAS DONE THIS SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE EXUBERANCE OF MIRTH SOMETIMES WITH ALL THE BITTERNESS OF A SATIRIST EVEN HIS BITTERNESS IS NEVER VENOMOUS HOWEVER HE IS GENIAL BEYOND THE MAJORITY OF INVETERATE CONTROVERSIALISTS AND PROPAGANDISTS
7402-59171-0041 HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO WOUND AND HE DOES NOT HESITATE TO MISUNDERSTAND BUT HE IS FREE FROM MALICE THE GENIALITY OF HIS COMEDY ON THE OTHER HAND IS OFTEN MORE OFFENSIVE THAN MALICE
7402-59171-0042 BECAUSE IT IS FROM AN ORTHODOX POINT OF VIEW GENIALITY IN THE WRONG PLACE IT IS LIKE A GRIN IN CHURCH A LAUGH AT A MARRIAGE SERVICE
7402-59171-0043 THAT HE WAS NOT INTENSELY SERIOUS IN ALL THAT HE WROTE ABOUT THE WAR BUT HIS SERIOUSNESS IS ESSENTIALLY THE SERIOUSNESS OF IN THE HIGHER SENSE OF THE WORD THE COMIC ARTIST OF THE DISILLUSIONIST
7402-59171-0044 HE SEES CURRENT HISTORY FROM THE ABSOLUTELY OPPOSITE POINT OF VIEW SAY TO THE LYRIC POET
7402-59171-0045 THOUGH HIS ATTITUDE TO THE WAR WAS AS ANTI PRUSSIAN
7402-59171-0046 A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE THOUGHT HE MUST BE A PRO GERMAN THE FACT IS IN WAR TIME MORE THAN AT ANY OTHER TIME PEOPLE DREAD THE VISION OF THE SATIRIST AND THE SCEPTIC
7402-59171-0047 THIS IS NOT TO DISPARAGE MISTER SHAW'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DISCUSSION OF POLITICS THAT CONTRIBUTION HAS BEEN BRILLIANT CHALLENGING AND HUMANE AND NOT MORE WAYWARD THAN THE CONTRIBUTION OF THE PARTISAN
7402-59171-0048 IT MAY BE SAID OF MISTER SHAW THAT IN HIS POLITICS AS IN HIS PLAYS HE HAS SOUGHT UTOPIA ALONG THE PATH OF DISILLUSION AS OTHER MEN HAVE SOUGHT IT ALONG THE PATH OF IDEALISM
7402-90848-0000 ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS AN OLD WIDOW WOMAN WHO HAD THREE SONS THE FIRST TWO WERE CLEVER ENOUGH BUT THE THIRD BOBO BY NAME WAS LITTLE BETTER THAN A SILLY SIMPLETON ALL HIS MOTHER'S SCOLDINGS AND BEATINGS
7402-90848-0001 AND SHE SMACKED THE POOR LAD SOUNDLY A DOZEN TIMES A DAY DID HIM NO GOOD WHATEVER NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT ONE MORNING PRINCESS ZENZA THE RULER OF THE LAND HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE COTTAGE AND HEARD BOBO BEING GIVEN A TERRIBLE TONGUE LASHING
7402-90848-0002 CURIOUS AS TO THE CAUSE OF ALL THE NOISE THE PRINCESS DREW REIN AND SUMMONED BOBO'S MOTHER TO COME NEAR ON HEARING HER STORY IT OCCURRED TO THE PRINCESS THAT SO SILLY A LAD MIGHT AMUSE HER
7402-90848-0003 NOW HE WOULD BE SENT TO FIND A WHITE CRAW'S FEATHER OR A SPRAY OF YELLOW BLUEBELLS NOW HE WAS ORDERED TO LOOK FOR A SQUARE WHEEL OR A GLASS OF DRY WATER EVERYBODY LAUGHED AT HIM AND MADE FUN OF HIM THAT IS
7402-90848-0004 EVERYBODY EXCEPT LITTLE TILDA THE KITCHEN MAID WHEN POOR BOBO USED TO RETURN FROM SOME WILD GOOSE CHASE TIRED OUT MUD STAINED AND OFTEN ENOUGH WET TO THE SKIN
7402-90848-0005 INSTEAD OF LAUGHING LITTLE TILDA WOULD FIND HIM A GLASS OF WARM MILK HANG HIS COAT BY THE FIRE TO DRY AND TELL HIM NOT TO BE SUCH A SIMPLETON AGAIN THUS AFTER A WHILE
7402-90848-0006 ONE PLEASANT MID SUMMER MORNING WHEN BOBO HAD BEEN NEARLY A YEAR AT THE CASTLE PRINCESS ZENZA OVERSLEPT HALF AN HOUR AND DID NOT COME DOWN TO BREAKFAST AT THE USUAL TIME WHEN SHE DID GET UP SHE FOUND HER COURT WAITING FOR HER IN THE CASTLE GARDENS
7402-90848-0007 SHALL WE SEND BOBO IN SEARCH OF THE LOST HALF HOUR SAID THE PRINCESS TO THE COURTIERS YES YES CRIED THE COURTIERS BOBO SHALL LOOK FOR THE LOST HALF HOUR I'LL GIVE HIM A HORSE SAID ONE
7402-90848-0008 WHEN HE RETURNED THE GOOD KITCHEN MAID SAID LITTLE FOR SHE FEARED LEST SOME MISADVENTURE OVERTAKE THE POOR SIMPLETON BUT WHEN THE CHIEF COOK WAS NOT LOOKING SHE TUCKED A FRESH CURRANT BUN INTO BOBO'S POCKET
7402-90848-0009 GOOD BYE BOBO CRIED THE ASSEMBLED COURTIERS WHO WERE ALMOST BESIDE THEMSELVES WITH LAUGHTER AT THE SIMPLETON AND HIS ERRAND DON'T FAIL TO BRING BACK THE LOST HALF HOUR SO BOBO RODE OVER THE HILLS AND FAR AWAY
7402-90848-0010 IT WAS VERY DIGNIFIED AND WORE TORTOISE SHELL GLASSES BUT BOBO HAD TO ANSWER NO AND THE OLD MAN WANDERED ON AGAIN ANOTHER DAY THE SIMPLETON ENCOUNTERED A TALL DARK FIERCE KIND OF FELLOW
7402-90848-0011 WHO ANSWERED HIS POLITE QUESTION WITH A SCREAM OF RAGE A HALF HOUR HE ROARED NO I HAVE N'T SEEN YOUR HALF HOUR I WOULD N'T TELL YOU IF I HAD WHAT'S MORE I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT
7402-90848-0012 I'M LOOKING FOR SOMETHING I'VE LOST MYSELF I'VE LOST MY TEMPER
7402-90848-0013 ANSWER ME YOU SILLY HAVE YOU SEEN A LOST TEMPER ANYWHERE IT'S ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE MELON AND HAS SHARP LITTLE POINTS ON BOBO'S ANSWERING NO THIS DREADFUL PERSON UTTERED SO PERFECTLY AWFUL A SCREECH OF RAGE
7402-90848-0014 THAT BOBO'S HORSE TOOK FRIGHT AND RAN AWAY WITH HIM AND IT WAS ALL THAT BOBO COULD DO TO REIN HIM IN THREE MILES FARTHER DOWN THE ROAD STILL FARTHER ALONG BOBO CAME TO ZIZZ THE CAPITAL CITY OF THE KINGDOM OF THE SEVEN BROOKS AND WAS TAKEN BEFORE THE KING HIMSELF
7402-90848-0015 HERE THE POOR OLD KING TOOK OUT A GREAT GREEN HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED HIS EYES SHE WAS STOLEN BY THE FAIRIES ON MIDSUMMER EVE FIFTEEN YEARS AGO FIND HER WORTHY BOBO AND AN IMMENSE REWARD WILL BE YOURS
7402-90848-0016 AND HE CONTINUED HIS WAY ON FOOT THREE LONG YEARS PASSED AND BOBO GREW INTO A HANDSOME LAD BUT REMAINED A SIMPLETON STILL FINALLY AFTER HE HAD WANDERED ALL ABOUT FAIRYLAND HE CAME TO THE EDGE OF THE SEA
7402-90848-0017 BOBO ASKED THE SAILORS IF THEY HAD SEEN A LOST HALF HOUR NO SAID THE SAILORS BUT WE ARE GOING TO THE ISLES OF IRON SUPPOSE YOU GO WITH US THE LOST HALF HOUR MAY BE THERE
7402-90848-0018 SO BOBO WENT ABOARD THE SHIP AND SAILED OUT UPON THE DARK SEA FOR TWO DAYS THE WEATHER WAS WARM AND CLEAR BUT ON THE THIRD DAY THERE CAME A DREADFUL STORM AND ON THE THIRD NIGHT THE VESSEL WAS DRIVEN FAR OFF HER COURSE INTO THE UNKNOWN OCEAN
7402-90848-0019 AND WAS WRECKED UPON A MYSTERIOUS ISLAND OF ROCKS THAT SHONE IN THE NIGHT LIKE WET MATCHES A GREAT WAVE SWEPT THE DECKS AND BOBO WAS BORNE AWAY FROM HIS COMPANIONS AND CARRIED TOWARD THE SHINING LAND
7402-90848-0020 THOUGH POUNDED AND BATTERED BY THE FOAMING WAVES THE SIMPLETON AT LENGTH MANAGED TO REACH THE BEACH AND TOOK REFUGE IN A CREVICE OF THE CLIFF DURING THE STORMY NIGHT WHEN THE DAWN BROKE ALL SIGN OF THE SHIP HAD DISAPPEARED
7402-90848-0021 LOOKING ABOUT BOBO FOUND HIMSELF ON A LOVELY ISLAND WHOSE HEART WAS A HIGH MOUNTAIN MASS HIDDEN IN THE FOG STILL SWEEPING IN FROM THE SEA THERE WAS NOT A HOUSE A ROAD OR A PATH TO BE SEEN
7402-90848-0022 IN WHICH WERE A PAIR OF WOODEN SHOES ABOVE THE SHOES WAS A CARD SAYING SIMPLY
7402-90848-0023 SO BOBO SAT DOWN ON A STONE BY THE FOOT OF THE TREE AND PUT ON THE WOODEN SHOES WHICH FITTED HIM VERY NICELY NOW THESE SHOES WERE MAGIC SHOES AND BOBO HAD HARDLY STEPPED INTO THEM BEFORE THEY TURNED HIS FEET INLAND
7402-90848-0024 SO BOBO OBEDIENTLY LET THE SHOES GUIDE HIM AT CORNERS THE SHOES ALWAYS TURNED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND IF BOBO FORGOT AND BLUNDERED ON THE WRONG WAY THE SHOES SWIFTLY BEGAN TO PINCH HIS TOES
7402-90848-0025 FOR TWO DAYS BOBO WALKED INLAND TOWARD THE GREAT MOUNTAIN A WARM WIND BLEW THE CLOUDS AND RAIN AWAY THE SUN SHONE SWEET AND CLEAR ON THE MORNING OF THE THIRD DAY THE SIMPLETON ENTERED A WOOD OF TALL SILENT TREES
7402-90848-0026 AND AS THAT DAY WAS DRAWING TO A CLOSE TURRETS OF A MAGNIFICENT CASTLE ROSE FAR AWAY OVER THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST BOBO ARRIVED AT TWILIGHT
7402-90848-0027 HE FOUND HIMSELF IN A BEAUTIFUL GARDEN LYING BETWEEN THE CASTLE WALLS AND THE RISING SLOPES OF A GREAT MOUNTAIN STRANGE TO SAY NOT A LIVING CREATURE WAS TO BE SEEN AND THOUGH THERE WERE LIGHTS IN THE CASTLE
7402-90848-0028 THERE WAS NOT EVEN A WARDER AT THE GATE SUDDENLY A GREAT BOOMING BELL STRUCK SEVEN O'CLOCK BOBO BEGAN TO HEAR VOICES AND SOUNDS AND THEN BEFORE THE HUMMING OF THE BELL HAD DIED AWAY
7402-90848-0029 A YOUTH MOUNTED ON A SPLENDID BLACK HORSE DASHED AT LIGHTNING SPEED OUT OF THE CASTLE AND DISAPPEARED IN THE WOOD AN OLD MAN WITH A WHITE BEARD ACCOMPANIED BY ELEVEN YOUNG MEN WHOM BOBO JUDGED FROM THEIR EXPRESSIONS TO BE BROTHERS
7402-90848-0030 STOOD BY THE GATE TO SEE THE HORSEMAN RIDE AWAY PLUCKING UP COURAGE BOBO CAME FORWARD FELL ON HIS KNEE BEFORE THE OLD MAN AND TOLD HIS STORY TRULY YOU SHOULD THANK THE STORM FAIRIES SAID THE OLD MAN
7402-90848-0031 FOR HAD YOU NOT BEEN WRECKED UPON THIS ISLAND NEVER WOULD YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE LOST HALF HOUR I AM FATHER TIME HIMSELF AND THESE ARE MY TWELVE SONS THE HOURS EVERY DAY ONE AFTER THE OTHER
7402-90848-0032 THEY RIDE FOR AN HOUR ROUND THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD SEVEN O'CLOCK HAS JUST RIDDEN FORTH YES YOU SHALL HAVE THE LOST HALF HOUR BUT YOU MUST LOOK AFTER MY SONS HORSES FOR THE SPACE OF A WHOLE YEAR TO THIS
7402-90848-0033 BOBO WILLINGLY AGREED SO TWELVE O'CLOCK WHO WAS THE YOUNGEST OF THE HOURS TOOK HIM TO THE STABLES AND SHOWED HIM THE LITTLE ROOM IN THE TURRET THAT HE WAS TO HAVE
7402-90848-0034 HE TOOK SUCH GOOD CARE OF THE GREAT BLACK HORSES OF THE HOURS OF THE NIGHT AND THE WHITE HORSES OF THE HOURS OF THE DAY THAT THEY WERE NEVER MORE PROUD AND STRONG NOR THEIR COATS SMOOTHER AND MORE GLEAMING WHEN THE YEAR WAS UP BOBO AGAIN SOUGHT OUT FATHER TIME
7402-90848-0035 YOU HAVE SERVED FAITHFULLY AND WELL SAID FATHER TIME HERE IS YOUR REWARD AND WITH THESE WORDS HE PLACED IN BOBO'S HANDS A SMALL SQUARE CASKET MADE OF EBONY THE HALF HOUR LIES INSIDE
7402-90848-0036 DON'T TRY TO PEEK AT IT OR OPEN THE BOX UNTIL THE RIGHT TIME HAS COME IF YOU DO THE HALF HOUR WILL FLYAWAY AND DISAPPEAR FOREVER FAREWELL BOBO SAID KIND YOUNG TWELVE O'CLOCK WHO HAD BEEN THE SIMPLETON'S GOOD FRIEND
7402-90848-0037 I TOO HAVE A GIFT FOR THEE DRINK THIS CUP OF WATER TO THE LAST DROP AND THE YOUTH HANDED THE SIMPLETON A SILVER CUP FULL TO THE BRIM OF CLEAR SHINING WATER NOW THIS WATER WAS THE WATER OF WISDOM
7402-90848-0038 AND WHEN BOBO HAD DRUNK IT HE WAS NO LONGER A SIMPLETON AND BEING NO LONGER A SIMPLETON HE REMEMBERED THE MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS REPUTATION THE MAN WHO HAD LOST HIS TEMPER AND THE KING WHOSE DAUGHTER HAD BEEN STOLEN BY THE FAIRIES
7402-90848-0039 TELL THE FIRST SAID FATHER TIME THAT HIS REPUTATION HAS BEEN BROKEN INTO A THOUSAND PIECES WHICH HAVE BEEN PICKED UP BY HIS NEIGHBORS AND CARRIED HOME IF HE CAN PERSUADE HIS NEIGHBORS TO GIVE THEM UP
7402-90848-0040 AS FOR THE MISSING DAUGHTER SHE IS THE KITCHEN MAID IN PRINCESS ZENZA'S PALACE WHO IS KNOWN AS TILDA SO BOBO THANKED FATHER TIME AND AT NOON
7402-90848-0041 TWELVE O'CLOCK PLACED HIM BEHIND HIM ON THE WHITE CHARGER AND HURRIED AWAY SO FAST THEY FLEW THAT BOBO WHO WAS HOLDING THE EBONY CASKET CLOSE AGAINST HIS HEART WAS IN GREAT DANGER OF FALLING OFF
7402-90848-0042 WHEN THEY GOT TO THE SEASHORE THE WHITE HORSE HESITATED NOT AN INSTANT BUT SET FOOT UPON THE WATER WHICH BORE HIM UP AS IF IT HAD BEEN NOT WATER BUT EARTH ITSELF
7402-90848-0043 BOBO WITH GREAT GOODNESS OF HEART TOOK ALONG THIS EXTRAORDINARY OBJECT IN THE HOPE OF FINDING ITS ANGRY POSSESSOR FARTHER ON THE LAD ENCOUNTERED TILDA'S FATHER THE UNHAPPY KING AND DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE
7402-90848-0044 THE JOY OF THE MONARCH KNEW NO BOUNDS AND BOBO THE ONE TIME SIMPLETON BECAME ON THE SPOT LORD BOBO OF THE SAPPHIRE HILLS MARQUIS OF THE MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON PRINCE OF THE VALLEY OF GOLDEN APPLES
7402-90848-0045 IN A WORD THE GREATEST NOBLEMAN IN ALL FAIRYLAND
7402-90848-0046 ALL IN SPLENDID SILKS AND SOLDIERS IN SHINING ARMOR THE DELIGHTED KING RODE OFF TO CLAIM HIS MISSING DAUGHTER FROM PRINCESS ZENZA SO ON THEY RODE THE HARNESSES JINGLING THE BRIDLE BELLS RINGING
7402-90848-0047 AND THE BREASTPLATES OF THE ARMED MEN SHINING IN THE SUN AFTER A WEEK OF ALMOST CONSTANT PROGRESS FOR THE KING WAS SO ANXIOUS TO SEE HIS BELOVED DAUGHTER THAT HE WOULD HARDLY GIVE THE CAVALCADE TIME TO REST
7402-90848-0048 ON THE STEPS OF ONE OF THE COTTAGES SAT AN OLD WOMAN ALL ALONE AND WEEPING WITH ALL HER MIGHT WHAT IS THE MATTER MY GOOD WOMAN SAID THE KING
7402-90848-0049 EVIL DAYS HAVE FALLEN UPON OUR UNHAPPY KINGDOM THREE DAYS AGO A TERRIBLE DRAGON ALIGHTED IN THE GARDENS OF THE PALACE AND SENT WORD TO PRINCESS ZENZA THAT IF WITHIN THREE DAYS SHE DID NOT PROVIDE HIM WITH SOMEONE BRAVE ENOUGH TO GO HOME WITH HIM AND COOK HIS MEALS
7402-90848-0050 AND KEEP HIS CAVERN TIDY HE WOULD BURN OUR FIELDS WITH HIS FIERY BREATH YET WHO I ASK YOU WOULD BE HOUSEKEEPER FOR A DRAGON
7402-90848-0051 THAT WE ARE MOURNING AT TWO O'CLOCK SHE IS TO BE CARRIED OFF BY THE DRAGON IT IS ALMOST TWO NOW ALAS ALAS HARDLY WERE THE WORDS OUT OF HER MOUTH WHEN THE TOWN BELL STRUCK TWICE SOLEMNLY AND SADLY
7402-90848-0052 QUICK QUICK CRIED THE KING AND BOBO IN THE SAME BREATH LET US HURRY TO THE CASTLE WE MAY SAVE HER YET BUT THEY KNEW IN THEIR HEARTS THAT THEY WERE TOO LATE AND THAT POOR TILDA HAD GIVEN HERSELF TO THE DRAGON
7402-90848-0053 AND SO IT PROVED IN SPITE OF HIS MAD DASH BOBO WHO HAD SPURRED ON AHEAD ARRIVED EXACTLY HALF AN HOUR LATE THE MONSTROUS DRAGON WITH TILDA IN HIS CLAWS
7402-90848-0054 THINGS SHOULD BE EXACTLY AS THEY WERE HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE OPENED THE COVER OF THE EBONY BOX SOMETHING LIKE A WINGED WHITE FLAME ESCAPED FROM IT AND FLEW HISSING THROUGH THE AIR TO THE SUN
7402-90848-0055 AS FOR THE SUN ITSELF TURNING ROUND LIKE A CARTWHEEL AND HISSING LIKE TEN THOUSAND ROCKETS IT ROLLED BACK ALONG THE SKY TO THE EAST THE HANDS OF THE CLOCKS WHICH MARKED HALF PAST TWO WHIRRED BACK TO TWO O'CLOCK IN A TWINKLING
7402-90848-0056 AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS BRAVE LITTLE TILDA STANDING ALONE IN A GREAT FIELD WAITING FOR THE DRAGON TO COME AND TAKE HER AWAY LUMBERING HEAVILY ALONG LIKE A MONSTROUS TURTLE AND SNORTING BLUE SMOKE
7402-90848-0057 THE DRAGON WAS ADVANCING TOWARD HER BOBO RAN DOWN INTO THE FIELD AND STOOD BESIDE TILDA READY TO DEFEND HER TO THE END THE DRAGON CAME NEARER AND NEARER SUDDENLY
7402-90848-0058 ANGERED BY THE SIGHT OF BOBO AND HIS DRAWN SWORD HE ROARED ANGRILY BUT CONTINUED TO APPROACH BOBO STRUCK AT HIM WITH HIS SWORD THE BLADE BROKE UPON HIS STEELY SCALES THE DRAGON ROARED AGAIN NOW
7402-90848-0059 JUST AS THE DRAGON'S MOUTH WAS ITS WIDEST BOBO WHO HAD BEEN SEARCHING HIS POCKETS DESPERATELY HURLED INTO IT THE LOST TEMPER THERE WAS A PERFECTLY TERRIFIC BANG AS IF A MILLION BALLOONS HAD BLOWN UP ALL AT ONCE
7402-90848-0060 FOR THE DRAGON HAD BLOWN UP THE LOST TEMPER HAD FINISHED HIM ONLY ONE FRAGMENT OF HIM A TINY BIT OF A CLAW WAS EVER FOUND
7402-90848-0061 THE GRAND CROSS OF THE ORDER OF THE BLACK CAT WAS CONFERRED UPON BOBO BY PRINCESS ZENZA WHO ALSO ASKED HIS PARDON FOR HAVING TREATED HIM SO SHABBILY THIS BOBO GAVE READILY
7402-90848-0062 WHEN THE REJOICINGS WERE OVER
7447-91186-0000 HOW SOON KEYS WERE ADDED TO THE MONOCHORD AS THIS MEASURING INSTRUMENT WAS NAMED CANNOT POSITIVELY BE ASCERTAINED WE MAY SAFELY ASSUME IT WAS NOT SLOW IN ADOPTING THE RUDE KEYBOARD ASCRIBED BY TRADITION TO PAN PIPES
7447-91186-0001 AND APPLIED TO THE PORTABLE ORGAN OF EARLY CHRISTIAN COMMUNITIES AFTER THE TENTH CENTURY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MONOCHORD SEEMS TO HAVE BEGUN IN EARNEST TWO OR MORE STRINGS OF EQUAL LENGTH ARE NOW DIVIDED
7447-91186-0002 AND SET IN MOTION BY FLAT METAL WEDGES ATTACHED TO THE KEY LEVERS AND CALLED TANGENTS BECAUSE THEY TOUCHED THE STRINGS IN RESPONSE TO THE DEMAND FOR INCREASED RANGE AS MANY AS TWENTY KEYS
7447-91186-0003 WERE BROUGHT TO ACT ON A FEW STRINGS COMMANDING OFTEN THREE OCTAVES
7447-91186-0004 THE FAMOUS SIGHT READING MUSIC TEACHER OF THE ELEVENTH CENTURY ADVISED HIS PUPILS TO EXERCISE THE HAND IN THE USE OF THE MONOCHORD SHOWING HIS KNOWLEDGE OF THE KEYBOARD THE KEYED MONOCHORD GAINED THE NAME
7447-91186-0005 CLAVICHORD ITS BOX LIKE CASE WAS FIRST PLACED ON A TABLE LATER ON ITS OWN STAND AND INCREASED IN ELEGANCE NOT UNTIL THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY WAS EACH KEY PROVIDED WITH A SEPARATE STRING
7447-91186-0006 OR KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTS THAT CAME INTO USE DANCE MUSIC FOUND IN THEM A CONGENIAL FIELD
7447-91186-0007 I ANSWER THAT YOU CANNOT YET OWING TO YOUR YOUTH UNDERSTAND THAT PLAYING IS ONLY SUITED FOR VOLATILE FRIVOLOUS WOMEN WHEREAS I DESIRE YOU TO BE THE MOST LOVABLE MAIDEN IN THE WORLD
7447-91186-0008 ALSO IT WOULD BRING YOU BUT LITTLE PLEASURE OR RENOWN IF YOU SHOULD PLAY BADLY
7447-91186-0009 CONSIDER A MOMENT WHETHER THIS WOULD BECOME YOU IF YOUR FRIENDS WISH YOU TO PLAY IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM PLEASURE TELL THEM YOU DO NOT DESIRE TO MAKE YOURSELF RIDICULOUS IN THEIR EYES AND BE CONTENT WITH YOUR BOOKS AND YOUR DOMESTIC OCCUPATIONS
7447-91186-0010 A DIFFERENT VIEW WAS ENTERTAINED IN ENGLAND DURING QUEEN ELIZABETH'S REIGN WHERE CLAVIERS WERE IN VOGUE STYLED VIRGINALS BECAUSE AS AN ANCIENT CHRONICLE EXPLAINED VIRGINS DO MOST COMMONLY PLAY ON THEM
7447-91186-0011 THE VIRGINAL WAS USUALLY OF OBLONG SHAPE OFTEN RESEMBLING A LADY'S WORKBOX WITH THE VIRGIN QUEEN IT WAS A PRIME FAVORITE ALTHOUGH NOT NAMED EXPRESSLY FOR HER AS THE FLATTERING FASHION OF THE TIME LED MANY TO ASSUME
7447-91186-0012 IF SHE ACTUALLY DID JUSTICE TO SOME OF THE AIRS WITH VARIATIONS IN THE QUEEN ELIZABETH VIRGINAL BOOK SHE MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN PROFICIENT ON THE INSTRUMENT QUAINT DOCTOR CHARLES BURNEY
7447-91186-0013 SEVENTEEN TWENTY SIX EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN DECLARES IN HIS HISTORY OF MUSIC THAT NO PERFORMER OF HIS DAY COULD PLAY THEM WITHOUT AT LEAST A MONTH'S PRACTICE
7447-91186-0014 THE CLAVIER GAVE PROMISE OF ITS DESTINED CAREER IN THE ELIZABETHAN AGE SHAKESPEARE IMMORTALIZED IT AND WILLIAM BYRD
7447-91186-0015 BECAME THE FIRST CLAVIER MASTER HE AND DOCTOR JOHN BULL
7447-91186-0016 REPRESENT THE TWO TYPES WHICH RUN THROUGH THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE CLAVIER BYRD WAS THE MORE INTIMATE DELICATE SPIRITUAL INTELLECT BULL THE UNTAMED GENIUS THE BRILLIANT
7447-91186-0017 EXECUTANT THE LESS EXQUISITELY REFINED ARTIST IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THESE TWO TYPES STAND TOGETHER ON THE THRESHOLD OF CLAVIER ART
7447-91186-0018 THE FOUNDING OF WHOSE CHAIR OF MUSIC IS POPULARLY ATTRIBUTED TO ALFRED THE GREAT AS EARLY AS THE YEAR FOURTEEN HUNDRED CLAVIERS HAD APPEARED WHOSE STRINGS WERE PLUCKED BY QUILLS
7447-91186-0019 ATTACHED TO JACKS AT THE END OF THE KEY LEVERS TO THIS GROUP BELONGED THE VIRGINAL OR VIRGINALS THE CLAVICEMBALO THE HARPSICHORD OR CLAVECIN AND THE SPINET STOPS WERE ADDED AS IN THE ORGAN
7447-91186-0020 THAT VARIED EFFECTS MIGHT BE PRODUCED AND A SECOND KEYBOARD WAS OFTEN PLACED ABOVE THE FIRST THE CASE WAS EITHER RECTANGULAR OR FOLLOWED THE OUTLINES OF THE HARP A PROGENITOR OF THIS CLAVIER TYPE
7447-91186-0021 THE SECULAR MUSIC PRINCIPLE OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY THAT CALLED INTO ACTIVE BEING THE ORCHESTRA LED ALSO TO A DESIRE FOR RICHER MUSICAL EXPRESSION IN HOME AND SOCIAL LIFE THAN THE FASHIONABLE LUTE AFFORDED
7447-91186-0022 AND THE CLAVIER ADVANCED IN FAVOR IN FRANCE BY FIFTEEN THIRTY THE DANCE THAT PROMOTER OF PURE INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC WAS FREELY TRANSCRIBED FOR THE CLAVIER LITTLE MORE THAN A CENTURY LATER JEAN BAPTISTE LULLY
7447-91186-0023 EXTENSIVELY EMPLOYED THE INSTRUMENT IN THE ORCHESTRATION OF HIS OPERAS AND WROTE SOLO DANCES FOR IT
7447-91186-0024 NOW WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN ALTHOUGH ONCE MENTIONED IN THE SAME BREATH WITH MOLIERE WROTE THE PIONEER CLAVIER INSTRUCTION BOOK IN IT HE DIRECTS SCHOLARS HOW TO AVOID A HARSH TONE AND HOW TO FORM A LEGATO STYLE
7447-91186-0025 HE ADVISES PARENTS TO SELECT TEACHERS ON WHOM IMPLICIT RELIANCE MAY BE PLACED AND TEACHERS TO KEEP THE CLAVIERS OF BEGINNERS UNDER LOCK AND KEY THAT THERE MAY BE NO PRACTICING WITHOUT SUPERVISION HIS SUGGESTIONS DESERVE CONSIDERATION TO DAY
7447-91186-0026 HE WAS THE FIRST TO ENCOURAGE PROFESSIONAL CLAVIER PLAYING AMONG WOMEN HIS DAUGHTER MARGUERITE WAS THE FIRST WOMAN APPOINTED OFFICIAL COURT CLAVIER PLAYER HE COMPOSED FOR THE CLAVIER LITTLE PICTURE TUNES
7447-91186-0027 DESIGNED TO DEPICT SENTIMENTS MOODS PHASES OF CHARACTER AND SCENES FROM LIFE HE FASHIONED MANY CHARMING TURNS OF EXPRESSION INTRODUCED AN OCCASIONAL TEMPO RUBATO FORESHADOWED THE INTELLECTUAL
7447-91186-0028 ELEMENT IN MUSIC AND LAID THE CORNER STONE OF MODERN PIANO PLAYING JEAN PHILIPPE RAMEAU
7447-91186-0029 CONTINUED COUPERIN'S WORK WHAT IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST PERIOD OF CLAVIER VIRTUOSITY BEGINS WITH THE NEAPOLITAN DOMENICO SCARLATTI
7447-91186-0030 AND JOHANN SEBASTIAN BACH
7447-91186-0031 THE GERMAN OF GERMANS THE STYLE OF SCARLATTI IS PECULIARLY THE PRODUCT OF ITALIAN LOVE OF BEAUTIFUL TONE
7447-91186-0032 KEPT WELL IN VIEW THE TECHNICAL POSSIBILITIES OF THE HARPSICHORD HIS CAT'S FUGUE AND HIS ONE MOVEMENT SONATAS STILL APPEAR ON CONCERT PROGRAMMES IN A COLLECTION OF THIRTY SONATAS HE EXPLAINED HIS PURPOSE IN THESE WORDS
7447-91186-0033 AMATEUR OR PROFESSOR WHOEVER THOU ART SEEK NOT IN THESE COMPOSITIONS FOR ANY PROFOUND FEELING THEY ARE ONLY A FROLIC OF ART MEANT TO INCREASE THY CONFIDENCE IN THE CLAVIER
7447-91186-0034 IN GERMANY WITH GRAND OLD FATHER BACH THE KEYBOARD INSTRUMENT WAS FOUND CAPABLE OF MIRRORING A MIGHTY SOUL THE GERM OF ALL MODERN MUSICAL DESIGN LIES IN HIS CLAVIER WRITINGS
7447-91186-0035 IT HAS BEEN APTLY SAID OF THIS MASTER OF MASTERS THAT HE CONSTRUCTED A GREAT UNIVERSITY OF MUSIC FROM WHICH ALL MUST GRADUATE WHO WOULD ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING OF VALUE IN MUSIC MEN OF GENIUS FROM MOZART TO THE PRESENT TIME
7447-91186-0036 HAVE EXTOLLED HIM FOR THE BEAUTY OF HIS MELODIES AND HARMONIES THE EXPRESSIVENESS OF HIS MODULATIONS THE WEALTH SPONTANEITY AND LOGICAL CLEARNESS OF HIS IDEAS AND THE SUPERB ARCHITECTURE OF HIS PRODUCTIONS
7447-91186-0037 STUDENTS MISS THE SOUL OF BACH BECAUSE OF THE SOULLESS MECHANICAL WAY IN WHICH THEY DEFACE HIS LEGACY TO THEM HIS TWELVE LITTLE PRELUDES ALONE CONTAIN THE MATERIALS FOR AN ENTIRE SYSTEM OF MUSIC THE INVENTIONS
7447-91186-0038 TOO OFTEN TREATED AS DRY AS DUST STUDIES ARE LADEN WITH BEAUTIFUL FIGURES AND DEVICES THAT FURNISH INSPIRATION FOR ALL TIME AS INDICATED BY THEIR TITLE WHICH SIGNIFIES A COMPOUND OF APPROPRIATE EXPRESSION
7447-91186-0039 AND JUST DISPOSITION OF THE MEMBERS THEY WERE DESIGNED TO CULTIVATE THE ELEMENTS OF MUSICAL TASTE AS WELL AS FREEDOM AND EQUALITY OF THE FINGERS HIS WELL TEMPERED CLAVICHORD HAS BEEN CALLED THE PIANIST'S SACRED BOOK
7447-91186-0040 ITS PRELUDES AND FUGUES ILLUSTRATE EVERY SHADE OF HUMAN FEELING AND WERE ESPECIALLY DESIGNED TO EXEMPLIFY THE MODE OF TUNING KNOWN AS EQUAL TEMPERAMENT INTRODUCED INTO GENERAL USE BY BACH
7447-91186-0041 AND STILL EMPLOYED BY YOUR PIANO TUNER AND MINE FORKEL HIS BIOGRAPHER HAS FINELY SAID THAT BACH CONSIDERED THE VOICES OF HIS FUGUES A SELECT COMPANY OF PERSONS CONVERSING TOGETHER
7447-91186-0042 EACH WAS ALLOWED TO SPEAK ONLY WHEN THERE WAS SOMETHING TO SAY BEARING ON THE SUBJECT IN HAND A HIGHLY CHARACTERISTIC MOTIVE OR THEME AS SIGNIFICANT AS THE NOBLEST TYPICAL PHRASE
7447-91186-0043 DEVELOPING INTO EQUALLY CHARACTERISTIC PROGRESSIONS AND CADENCES IS A STRIKING FEATURE OF THE BACH FUGUE HIS SUITES EXALTED FOREVER THE FAMILIAR DANCE TUNES OF THE GERMAN PEOPLE HIS WONDERFUL CHROMATIC FANTASIA AND FUGUE
7447-91187-0000 THE PIANO BARD THE PIANO RHAPSODIST THE PIANO MIND THE PIANO SOUL IS CHOPIN SAID RUBINSTEIN TRAGIC ROMANTIC LYRIC HEROIC DRAMATIC FANTASTIC SOULFUL
7447-91187-0001 SWEET DREAMY BRILLIANT GRAND SIMPLE ALL POSSIBLE EXPRESSIONS ARE FOUND IN HIS COMPOSITIONS AND ALL ARE SUNG BY HIM ON HIS INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0002 IN THESE FEW BOLD STROKES ONE WHO KNEW HIM BY VIRTUE OF CLOSE ART AND RACE KINSHIP PRESENTS AN INCOMPARABLE OUTLINE SKETCH OF THE POLISH TONE POET
7447-91187-0003 WHO EXPLORED THE HARMONIC VASTNESS OF THE PIANOFORTE AND MADE HIS OWN ALL ITS MYSTIC SECRETS BORN AND BRED ON POLAND'S SOIL SON OF A FRENCH FATHER AND A POLISH MOTHER FREDERIC CHOPIN
7447-91187-0004 COMBINED WITHIN HIMSELF TWO NATURES EACH COMPLEMENTING THE OTHER BOTH UNITING TO FORM A PERSONALITY NOT UNDERSTOOD BY EVERY CASUAL OBSERVER HE IS DESCRIBED AS KIND COURTEOUS
7447-91187-0005 POSSESSED OF THE MOST CAPTIVATING GRACE AND EASE OF MANNER NOW INCLINED TO LANGUOROUS MELANCHOLY NOW SCINTILLATING WITH A JOYOUS VIVACITY THAT WAS CONTAGIOUS
7447-91187-0006 HIS SENSITIVE NATURE LIKE THE MOST EXQUISITELY CONSTRUCTED SOUNDING BOARD VIBRATED WITH THE DESPAIRING SADNESS THE SUPPRESSED WRATH AND THE SUBLIME FORTITUDE OF THE BRAVE HAUGHTY
7447-91187-0007 UNHAPPY PEOPLE HE LOVED AND WITH HIS OWN HOMESICKNESS WHEN AFAR FROM HIS CHERISHED NATIVE LAND PATRIOT AND TONE POET IN EVERY FIBRE OF HIS BEING
7447-91187-0008 HIS GENIUS INEVITABLY CLAIMED AS ITS OWN THE SOUL'S DIVINEST LANGUAGE PURE MUSIC UNFETTERED BY WORDS THE PROFOUND RESERVE OF HIS NATURE MADE IT PECULIARLY
7447-91187-0009 AGREEABLE TO HIM TO GRATIFY THE HAUNTING DEMANDS OF HIS LYRIC MUSE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE ONE MUSICAL INSTRUMENT THAT LENDS ITSELF IN PRIVACY TO THE EXPLOITATION OF ALL THE MYSTERIES OF HARMONY
7447-91187-0010 STRONG CONVICTION IN REGARD TO HIS OWN CALLING AND CLEAR PERCEPTION OF THE HIDDEN POWERS AND FUTURE MISSION OF THE PIANO EARLY COMPELLED HIM TO CONSECRATE TO IT HIS UNFALTERING DEVOTION
7447-91187-0011 HE EVOLVED FROM ITS MORE INTIMATE DOMAIN EFFECTS IN SYMPATHY WITH THOSE OF THE ORCHESTRA YET PURELY INDIVIDUAL HE ENRICHED IT WITH NEW MELODIC HARMONIC AND RHYTHMIC DEVICES ADAPTED TO ITSELF ALONE
7447-91187-0012 AND ENDOWED IT WITH A WARMTH OF TONE COLORING THAT SPIRITUALIZED IT FOR ALL TIME TO THE PIANO HE CONFIDED ALL THE CONFLICTS THAT RAGED WITHIN HIM ALL THE COURAGE AND LIVING HOPE THAT SUSTAINED HIM
7447-91187-0013 IN GIVING TONAL FORM TO THE DEEP THINGS OF THE SOUL WHICH ARE UNIVERSAL IN THEIR ESSENCE AND APPLICATION HE EMBODIED UNIVERSAL RATHER THAN MERELY INDIVIDUAL EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCES
7447-91187-0014 AND THUS UNBARED WHAT WAS MOST SACRED TO HIMSELF WITHOUT JARRING ON THE INNATE RETICENCE WHICH MADE PURELY PERSONAL CONFIDENCES IMPOSSIBLE
7447-91187-0015 ALTHOUGH HIS MODE OF EXPRESSION WAS PECULIARLY HIS OWN HE HAD RECEIVED A STRONG IMPULSE FROM THE POPULAR MUSIC OF POLAND
7447-91187-0016 THEY WERE HIS EARLIEST MODELS ON THEM WERE BUILDED HIS FIRST THEMES
7447-91187-0017 SO CHOPIN GLORIFIED THOSE OF THE POLES THE NATIONAL TONALITY BECAME TO HIM A VEHICLE TO BE FREIGHTED WITH HIS OWN INDIVIDUAL CONCEPTIONS I SHOULD LIKE TO BE TO MY PEOPLE
7447-91187-0018 WHAT UHLAND WAS TO THE GERMANS HE ONCE SAID TO A FRIEND HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE HEART OF THIS PEOPLE AND IMMORTALIZED ITS JOYS SORROWS AND CAPRICES BY THE FORCE OF HIS SPLENDID ART
7447-91187-0019 THOSE WHO HAVE ATTEMPTED TO INTERPRET HIM AS THE SENTIMENTAL HERO OF MINOR MOODS THE TONE POET IN WHOM THE WEAKNESS OF DESPAIR PREDOMINATES HAVE MISSED THE LEAPING FLAMES THE VIVID INTENSITY
7447-91187-0020 TRUE ART SOFTENS THE HARSHEST ACCENTS OF SUFFERING BY PLACING SUPERIOR TO IT SOME ELEVATING IDEA SO IN THE MOST MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF HIS MUSIC ONE WHO HEEDS WELL MAY DETECT THE PRESENCE OF A LOFTY IDEAL
7447-91187-0021 THAT UPLIFTS AND STRENGTHENS THE TRAVAILING SOUL IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE HAD A SAD HEART BUT A JOYFUL MIND THE TWO TEACHERS OF CHOPIN WERE
7447-91187-0022 ZWYNY A BOHEMIAN VIOLINIST WHO TAUGHT THE PIANO AND JOSEPH ELSNER A VIOLINIST ORGANIST AND THEORIST FROM ZWYNY AND ELSNER EVEN THE GREATEST DUNCE MUST LEARN SOMETHING HE IS QUOTED AS SAYING
7447-91187-0023 NEITHER OF THESE MEN ATTEMPTED TO HAMPER HIS FREE GROWTH BY RIGID TECHNICAL RESTRAINTS THEIR GUIDANCE LEFT HIM MASTER OF HIS OWN GENIUS AT LIBERTY TO SOAR LIKE THE LARK INTO THE ETHEREAL BLUE OF THE SKIES
7447-91187-0024 HE RESPECTED THEM BOTH A REVERING AFFECTION WAS CHERISHED BY HIM FOR ELSNER TO WHOM HE OWED HIS SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO HIS ART HIS HABITS OF SERIOUS STUDY
7447-91187-0025 AND HIS INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH BACH THERE IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT IN THE FACT THAT THIS PRINCE CHARMING OF THE PIANO WHOSE MAGIC TOUCH AWAKENED THE SLEEPING BEAUTY OF THE INSTRUMENT OF WOOD AND WIRES NEVER HAD A LESSON IN HIS LIFE
7447-91187-0026 FROM A MERE PIANO SPECIALIST LISZT ONCE SAID CHOPIN WAS THE ONLY PIANIST HE EVER KNEW THAT COULD PLAY THE VIOLIN ON THE PIANO IF HE COULD DO SO IT WAS BECAUSE HE HAD HARKENED TO THE VOICE OF THE VIOLIN
7447-91187-0027 AND RESOLVED TO SHOW THAT THE PIANO TOO COULD PRODUCE THRILLING EFFECTS IN THE SAME WAY HE HAD LISTENED TO THE HUMAN VOICE AND DETERMINED THAT THE SONG OF HIS OWN INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE HEARD
7447-91187-0028 THOSE WHO GIVE EAR TO THE PIANO ALONE WILL NEVER LEARN THE SECRET OF CALLING FORTH ITS SUPREME ELOQUENCE WE CAN SEE AND HEAR THIS RAPHAEL OF MUSIC AT THE PIANO
7447-91187-0029 SO MANY AND SO ELOQUENT HAVE BEEN THE DESCRIPTIONS GIVEN OF HIS PLAYING IT IS EASY TO FANCY HIM SWEEPING THE IVORY KEYS WITH HIS GOSSAMER TOUCH THAT ENVELOPED WITH ETHEREAL BEAUTY
7447-91187-0030 THE MOST UNACCUSTOMED OF HIS COMPLICATED CHROMATIC MODULATIONS WE CAN FEEL HIS INDIVIDUALITY PULSATING THROUGH EVERY TONE EVOKED BY THOSE INDIVIDUALIZED FINGERS OF HIS AS THEY WEAVE MEASURES FOR SYLPHS
7447-91187-0031 WE MARVEL AT HIS SOFTLY WHISPERED YET EVER CLEARLY DISTINCT PIANISSIMO AT THE FULL ROUND TONE OF ITS RELATIVE FORTISSIMO THAT WAS NEVER HARSH OR NOISY
7447-91187-0032 AND AT ALL THE EXQUISITELY GRADED NUANCES THAT LAY BETWEEN WITH THOSE TIME FLUCTUATIONS EXPRESSIVE OF THE EBB AND FLOW OF HIS POETIC INNER BEING
7447-91187-0033 NO WONDER BALZAC MAINTAINED THAT IF CHOPIN SHOULD BUT DRUM ON THE TABLE HIS FINGERS WOULD EVOKE SUBTLE SOUNDING MUSIC AND WHAT AN EXAMPLE HE HAS LEFT FOR TEACHERS DELICATELY STRUNG AS HE WAS
7447-91187-0034 HE MUST OFTEN HAVE ENDURED TORTURES FROM THE BEST OF HIS PUPILS BUT SO THOROUGHLY WAS HE CONSECRATED TO HIS ART THAT HE NEVER FALTERED IN HIS EFFORTS TO LIFT THOSE WHO CONFIDED IN HIM
7447-91187-0035 TO THE AERIAL HEIGHTS HE HAD FOUND A VIVID PICTURE OF HIS METHOD OF TEACHING IS GIVEN IN THE LECTURES ON FREDERIC CHOPIN'S WORKS AND THEIR PROPER INTERPRETATION BY THE POLE JEAN KLECZYNSKI
7447-91187-0036 THE BASIS OF THIS METHOD CONSISTED IN REFINEMENT OF TOUCH FOR THE ATTAINMENT OF WHICH A NATURAL EASY POSITION OF THE HAND WAS CONSIDERED BY CHOPIN A PRIME REQUISITE HE PREPARED EACH HAND WITH INFINITE CARE
7447-91187-0037 BEFORE PERMITTING ANY ATTEMPT AT THE REPRODUCTION OF MUSICAL IDEAS IN ORDER TO PLACE IT TO ADVANTAGE HE CAUSED IT TO BE THROWN LIGHTLY ON THE KEYBOARD SO THAT THE FIVE FINGERS RESTED ON THE NOTES E F SHARP G SHARP A SHARP AND B
7447-91187-0038 AND WITHOUT CHANGE OF POSITION REQUIRED THE PRACTICE OF EXERCISES CALCULATED TO INSURE INDEPENDENCE THE PUPIL WAS INSTRUCTED TO GO THROUGH THESE EXERCISES FIRST STACCATO EFFECTED BY A FREE MOVEMENT OF THE WRIST
7447-91187-0039 AN ADMIRABLE MEANS OF COUNTERACTING HEAVINESS AND CLUMSINESS THEN LEGATO STACCATO THEN ACCENTED LEGATO THEN PURE LEGATO
7447-91187-0040 AND THE MOVEMENT FROM ANDANTE TO PRESTISSIMO HE WAS EXCEEDINGLY PARTICULAR ABOUT ARPEGGIO WORK AND INSISTED UPON THE REPETITION OF EVERY NOTE AND PASSAGE UNTIL ALL HARSHNESS AND ROUGHNESS OF TONE WERE ELIMINATED
7447-91187-0041 HE NEVER HESITATED ABOUT PLACING IT ON A BLACK KEY WHEN CONVENIENT AND HAD IT PASSED BY MUSCLE ACTION ALONE IN SCALES AND BROKEN CHORDS WHOSE ZEALOUS PRACTICE IN DIFFERENT FORMS OF TOUCH ACCENT RHYTHM AND TONE
7447-91187-0042 WERE DEMANDED BY HIM INDIVIDUALIZATION OF THE FINGERS WAS ONE OF HIS STRONG POINTS AND HE BELIEVED IN ASSIGNING TO EACH OF THEM ITS APPROPRIATE PART IN A GOOD MECHANISM HE SAID
7447-91187-0043 THE AIM IS NOT TO PLAY EVERYTHING WITH AN EQUAL SOUND BUT TO ACQUIRE BEAUTIFUL QUALITY OF TOUCH AND PERFECT SHADING OF PRIME IMPORTANCE IN HIS EYES WAS A CLEAR ELASTIC SINGING TONE
7447-91187-0044 ONE WHOSE EXQUISITE DELICACY COULD NEVER BE CONFOUNDED WITH FEEBLENESS
7447-91187-0045 AND HE KNEW HOW TO AUGMENT THE WARMTH AND RICHNESS OF TONE COLORING BY SETTING IN VIBRATION SYMPATHETIC HARMONICS OF THE PRINCIPAL NOTES THROUGH JUDICIOUS EMPLOYMENT OF THE DAMPER PEDAL
7447-91187-0046 BY PRECEPT AND EXAMPLE HE ADVOCATED FREQUENT PLAYING OF THE PRELUDES AND FUGUES OF BACH AS A MEANS OF CULTIVATING MUSICAL INTELLIGENCE MUSCULAR INDEPENDENCE AND TOUCH AND TONE DISCRIMINATION HIS MUSICAL HEROES WERE BACH AND MOZART
7447-91187-0047 FOR THEY REPRESENTED TO HIM NATURE STRONG INDIVIDUALITY AND POETRY IN MUSIC AT ONE TIME HE UNDERTOOK TO WRITE A METHOD OR SCHOOL OF PIANO PLAYING BUT NEVER PROGRESSED BEYOND THE OPENING SENTENCES
7447-91187-0048 A MESSAGE DIRECTLY FROM HIM WOULD HAVE BEEN INVALUABLE TO STUDENTS AND MIGHT HAVE AVERTED MANY UNLUCKY MISAPPREHENSIONS OF HIMSELF AND HIS WORKS THOSE OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES WHO HAVE HARKENED WITH RAPTURE TO HIS PLAYING HAVE DECLARED THAT HE ALONE
7447-91187-0049 COULD ADEQUATELY INTERPRET HIS TONE CREATIONS OR MAKE PERFECTLY INTELLIGIBLE HIS METHOD PUPILS OF HIS AND THEIR PUPILS HAVE FAITHFULLY ENDEAVORED TO TRANSMIT TO THE MUSICAL WORLD THE TRADITION OF HIS INDIVIDUAL STYLE
7447-91187-0050 THE ELECT FEW HAVE COME INTO TOUCH WITH HIS VISION OF BEAUTY BUT IT HAS BEEN MERCILESSLY MISINTERPRETED BY THOUSANDS OF RUTHLESS ASPIRANTS TO MUSICAL HONORS IN THE SCHOOLROOM THE STUDENTS RECITAL AND THE CONCERT HALL
7447-91187-0051 WHOEVER PLAYS CHOPIN WITH SLEDGE HAMMER FINGERS WILL DEADEN ALL SENSE OF HIS POETRY CHARM AND GRACE WHOEVER APPROACHES HIM WITH WEAK SENTIMENTALISM WILL MISS ALTOGETHER HIS DIGNITY AND STRENGTH
7447-91187-0052 IT HAS BEEN SAID OF HIM THAT HE WAS WOMAN IN HIS TENDERNESS AND REALIZATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL AND MAN IN HIS ENERGY AND FORCE OF MIND THE HIGHEST TYPE OF ARTIST AND HUMAN BEING IS THUS REPRESENTED
7447-91187-0053 TO INTERPRET HIM REQUIRES SIMPLICITY PURITY OF STYLE REFINED TECHNIQUE POETIC IMAGINATION AND GENUINE SENTIMENT NOT FITFUL FICTITIOUS SENTIMENTALITY
7447-91187-0054 SERENELY FANCYING THEY ARE HEEDING THE MASTER'S DESIGN RECKLESS OUT OF TIME PLAYING DISFIGURES WHAT IS MEANT TO EXPRESS THE FLUCTUATION OF THOUGHT THE SOUL'S AGITATION THE ROLLING OF THE WAVES OF TIME AND ETERNITY
7447-91187-0055 THE RUBATO FROM RUBARE TO ROB REPRESENTS A PLIABLE MOVEMENT THAT IS CERTAINLY AS OLD AS THE GREEK DRAMA IN DECLAMATION AND WAS EMPLOYED IN INTONING THE GREGORIAN CHANT
7447-91187-0056 INDICATIONS OF IT IN BACH ARE TOO OFTEN NEGLECTED BEETHOVEN USED IT EFFECTIVELY CHOPIN APPROPRIATED IT AS ONE OF HIS MOST POTENT AUXILIARIES IN PLAYING HE EMPHASIZED THE SAYING OF MOZART
7447-91187-0057 ITS LEAVES TREMBLE WITH EVERY BREATH OF THE WIND BUT THE TREE REMAINS UNSHAKEN THAT IS THE RUBATO THERE ARE STORMS TO WHICH EVEN THE TREE YIELDS TO REALIZE THEM TO DIVINE THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE UNDULATING TEMPEST TOSSED RUBATO
7447-91187-0058 REQUIRES HIGHLY MATURED ARTISTIC TASTE AND ABSOLUTE MUSICAL CONTROL TOO SENSITIVE TO ENJOY PLAYING BEFORE MISCELLANEOUS AUDIENCES WHOSE UNSYMPATHETIC CURIOSITY HE DECLARED PARALYZED HIM
7447-91187-0059 CHOPIN WAS AT HIS BEST WHEN INTERPRETING MUSIC IN PRIVATE FOR A CHOICE CIRCLE OF FRIENDS OR PUPILS OR WHEN ABSORBED IN COMPOSITION IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY FOR HIM THAT HE USHERED IN A NEW ERA FOR HIS CHOSEN INSTRUMENT
7447-91187-0060 SPIRITUALIZING ITS TIMBRE LIBERATING IT FROM TRADITIONAL ORCHESTRAL AND CHORAL EFFECTS AND ELEVATING IT TO AN INDEPENDENT POWER IN THE WORLD OF MUSIC BESIDES ENRICHING THE TECHNIQUE OF THE PIANO HE AUGMENTED THE MATERIALS OF MUSICAL EXPRESSION
7447-91187-0061 HARMONY AND RHYTHM NEW CHORD EXTENSIONS PASSAGES OF DOUBLE NOTES ARABESQUES AND HARMONIC COMBINATIONS WERE DEVISED BY HIM
7447-91187-0062 AND HE SO SYSTEMATIZED THE USE OF THE PEDALS THAT THE MOST VARIED NUANCES COULD BE PRODUCED BY THEM IN MELODY AND GENERAL CONCEPTION HIS TONE POEMS SPRANG SPONTANEOUSLY FROM HIS GLOWING FANCY
7447-91187-0063 BUT THEY WERE SUBJECTED TO THE MOST SEVERE TESTS BEFORE THEY WERE PERMITTED TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD EVERY INGENIOUS DEVICE THAT GAVE CHARACTER TO HIS EXQUISITE CANTILENA AND SOFTENED HIS MOST STARTLING CHORD PROGRESSIONS
7447-91187-0064 DISCUSSING THE COMPOSITIONS OF CHOPIN IN HIS DELIGHTFUL AND INSPIRING BOOK CHOPIN THE MAN AND HIS MUSIC CALLS THE STUDIES TITANIC EXPERIMENTS
7447-91187-0065 THE PRELUDES MOODS IN MINIATURE THE NOCTURNES NIGHT AND ITS MELANCHOLY MYSTERIES
7447-91187-0066 FAERY DRAMAS THE POLONAISES HEROIC HYMNS OF BATTLE THE VALSES AND MAZURKAS
7447-91187-0067 TO WRITE OF THE FOUR IMPROMPTUS IN THEIR OWN KEY OF UNRESTRAINED FEELING AND PONDERED INTENTION WOULD NOT BE AS EASY AS RECAPTURING THE FIRST CARELESS RAPTURE OF THE LARK UNQUESTIONABLY
7447-91187-0068 THE POETRY OF CHOPIN IS OF THE MOST EXQUISITE LYRIC CHARACTER HIS LEADERSHIP IS SUPREME SO ORIGINAL WAS HIS CONCEPTION SO FINISHED HIS WORKMANSHIP SO SUBLIME HIS PURPOSE
7447-91187-0069 THAT WE MAY WELL EXCLAIM WITH SCHUMANN HE IS THE BOLDEST PROUDEST POETIC SPIRIT OF THE TIME HIS GREATNESS IS HIS ARISTOCRACY SAYS OSCAR BIE HE STANDS AMONG MUSICIANS IN HIS FAULTLESS VESTURE
7505-258958-0000 SATISFACTION AND GRATIFICATION BEING ONLY TEMPORARY CONDITIONS ECONOMIC WANTS APPEAR IN MORE OR LESS REGULARLY RECURRING SERIES IMPRESSIONS ARE SHORT LIVED SENSATIONS ARE TEMPORARY
7505-258958-0001 WANTS THAT HAVE BEEN SATISFIED RECUR WANTS RECUR FOR THE SAME REASON THAT THEY FIRST AROSE NO IMPRESSION ON THE NERVES OR ON THE SENSES IS LASTING
7505-258958-0002 THE UTILITY TO THAT PERSON OF THAT THING OR SERVICE FOR THAT PARTICULAR MOMENT FALLS IT MAY BE EVEN TO ZERO TO KEEP WANTS SATISFIED IS IMPOSSIBLE WE CANNOT DO NEXT YEAR'S READING OR NEXT WEEK'S EATING NOW
7505-258958-0003 IN ITS POWER TO GRATIFY WANTS THE CLOSER THE CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN THE TWO SERIES THAT OF WANTS AND THAT OF GOODS THE GREATER WILL BE THE TOTAL OF GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0004 OR BY SOCIETY DURING THE INCOME PERIOD THE TERM NATIONAL OR SOCIAL INCOME MAY BE CONTRASTED WITH INDIVIDUAL OR PRIVATE INCOME IN THE OBJECTIVE SENSE
7505-258958-0005 ONLY WHEN GOODS ARE PRODUCED INDIVIDUALS MAY ACQUIRE INCOME BY GIFT BEQUEST THEFT OR OTHER MODES OF TRANSFER FROM OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN MANY CASES THE TWO KINDS OF INCOME HOWEVER AGREE
7505-258958-0006 THE OBJECTIVE INCOME OF SOCIETY BEING THE ALGEBRAIC SUM OF THE GOODS ACQUIRED OR PARTED WITH BY ALL THE INDIVIDUALS WE SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THAT EITHER SOCIAL OR PRIVATE OBJECTIVE INCOMES INCLUDE ONLY MATERIAL GOODS
7505-258958-0007 FOR MANY UTILITIES AND LABOR SERVICES THAT NEVER TAKE ON A MATERIAL OR MONEY EXPRESSION ARE INCLUDED IN EITHER CASE INDEED WE ARE CLOSE HERE TO THE CONCEPTION OF PSYCHIC INCOME
7505-258958-0008 MUST BE A NET ADDITION BUT THE TERM GROSS INCOME IS NOT WITHOUT POPULAR AND PRACTICAL MEANING GROSS INCOME IS SOMETIMES SPOKEN OF IN THE SENSE OF TOTAL RECEIPTS
7505-258958-0009 AS THE TOTAL OF GOODS SECURED NET INCOME IS THE REMAINDER AFTER DEDUCTING EXPENDITURES AND AFTER REPLACING THE GOODS EMPLOYED TO SECURE THE INCOME IN ORDER TO PRODUCE SOME GOODS TECHNICALLY
7505-258958-0010 MEN MAKE USE OF OTHER GOODS WHILE THEY ARE STORING UP A SUPPLY OF WOOD OR COAL IT MAY BE LOOKED UPON AS THE INCOME BUT THEY MAY BURN IT TO HELP GROW HOTHOUSE PLANTS
7505-258958-0011 WHILE THEY GATHER FLOWERS WITH ONE HAND THEY DESTROY FUEL WITH THE OTHER ONLY THE NET INCREASE IN VALUE CAN BE ACCOUNTED INCOME IN THE SECOND PERIOD
7505-258958-0012 THE GOODS THAT COME INTO A MAN'S POSSESSION IN ANY PERIOD ARE OF MANY SORTS TO GET SOME HE HAS DESTROYED MANY PREVIOUSLY EXISTING GOODS
7505-258958-0013 WHILE TO GET OTHERS HE HAS NOT NEEDED TO USE UP THE ACCUMULATIONS OF THE PAST OR TO MORTGAGE THE FUTURE THE ONE KIND IS GROSS THE OTHER NET INCOME
7505-258958-0014 OF A SERIES OF GRATIFICATIONS IS A REGULAR SERIES OF CONSUMPTION GOODS BUT MANY THINGS EXISTING WHICH COULD BE USED TO SECURE A GRATIFICATION ARE NOT IN FACT TREATED AS CONSUMPTION GOODS
7505-258958-0015 A CROP OF CORN IS NOT ALL INCOME IN A TIME OF FAMINE IT COULD BE USED BUT SEED CORN WAS SAVED FROM LAST YEAR
7505-258958-0016 IT IS TRUE THAT EVERYTHING CALLED WEALTH IS EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE SOONER OR LATER IN SOME WAY TO THE SUM OF GRATIFICATIONS IT IS FOR THAT REASON IT IS CALLED WEALTH IT IS HOWEVER
7505-258958-0017 A MERE FIGURE OF SPEECH TO SAY INDIRECT WANT GRATIFIERS BECOME WANT GRATIFYING GOODS FOR EXAMPLE THE ENGINE TRANSPORTING A LOAD OF COAL IS INDIRECTLY GRATIFYING WANTS
7505-258958-0018 BETWEEN PRESENT AND FUTURE INCOMES THE VALUE OF THE MASS OF WEALTH IN POSSESSION AND YIELDING INCOME RESTS IN LARGE PART UPON ITS POWER OF CONTRIBUTING TO INCOME IN SOME FUTURE PERIOD THUS
7505-258958-0019 SUCH AS LANDS RAILROAD STOCKS GOVERNMENT BONDS ET CETERA THE INCOME IS FUNDED BECAUSE IT CORRESPONDS TO AN ABIDING FUND OF WEALTH THE INCOME ARISING FROM CURRENT LABOR IS UNFUNDED
7505-258958-0020 BECAUSE THERE IS NO PERMANENT FUND OF ACCUMULATED WEALTH CORRESPONDING TO IT THE IDEA OF REGULARITY CONNECTED WITH FUNDED INCOME IS NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE IDEA OF INCOME IN GENERAL
7505-258958-0021 IF IT IS PART OF THE SUM OF GOODS THAT FLOWS IN THAT IS NEWLY AVAILABLE FOR THE MAN'S USE IT IS INCOME BUT FUNDED INCOME IS THE MORE ABIDING FOR INCOME FROM WAGES STOPS
7505-258958-0022 THE REAL INCOME BUT CERTAINLY IT IS NOT INCOME IN THE MOST ESSENTIAL SENSE THINGS OUTSIDE OF MEN CANNOT BE FEELINGS THEY CAN ONLY CALL OUT OR OCCASION FEELING
7505-258958-0023 AND REDUCIBLE TO PSYCHIC INCOME SOME PORTIONS AT LEAST OF THE OBJECTIVE INCOMES OF GOODS ARE CONTINUALLY BY USE BECOMING SUBJECTIVE INCOMES OF ENJOYMENT
7505-258958-0024 MEN TALK OF MATERIAL INCOME AS CONSISTING OF BUSHELS OF WHEAT HEAD OF CATTLE ET CETERA AND OF IMMATERIAL INCOME AS THE USES THAT DURABLE GOODS YIELD DIRECTLY
7505-258958-0025 OR THAT MEN PERFORM FOR EACH OTHER E G THOSE OF THE SINGER PHYSICIAN TEACHER JUDGE ALL SERVICES THAT DO NOT TAKE ON MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0026 THERE WAS A LONG STANDING DISPUTE IN ECONOMIC LITERATURE REGARDING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PRODUCTIVE AND UNPRODUCTIVE LABOR PRODUCTIVE LABOR WAS SAID TO BE THAT WHICH EMBODIED ITSELF IN ABIDING MATERIAL FORM
7505-258958-0027 THE DISTINCTION LED TO SOME PECULIAR PUZZLES AND PARADOXES THE BARTENDER MIXING DRINKS ADDS TO THE VALUE OF THOSE INGREDIENTS IN A MINUTE THAT VALUE IS DISSIPATED
7505-258958-0028 ACCORDING TO THE DISTINCTION IN QUESTION HE IS A PRODUCTIVE LABORER BECAUSE HIS SERVICES ARE EMBODIED IN MATERIAL FORM WHEREAS THE LECTURER IS REGARDED AS AN UNPRODUCTIVE LABORER
7505-258958-0029 BUT WHETHER OR NOT THE SERVICE HAS FOR A MOMENT EMBODIED ITSELF IN MATERIAL FORM IS OF NO ESSENTIAL ECONOMIC IMPORT
7505-258958-0030 BUT A SIMILAR DISTINCTION IS INCONSISTENTLY PRESERVED BY MANY WRITERS IN THE CASE OF MATERIAL THINGS A BUILDING USED AS A FACTORY IS CALLED PRODUCTIVE
7505-258958-0031 BUT USED BY THE OWNER AS A DWELLING IT IS CALLED UNPRODUCTIVE BECAUSE THE SERVICE IT RENDERS DOES NOT APPEAR IN MATERIAL FORM BUT THE USE OF THE HOUSE OR THAT OF LAND FOR A SCHOOL GROUND OR CAMPUS
7505-258958-0032 AND THUS HIS FELT DEPENDENCE ON GOODS EXTENDS OVER A SERIES OF FUTURE PRODUCTIVE AGENTS IN ORDER TO SIMPLIFY THE PROBLEM WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE ECONOMIC MAN AS LIVING ONLY IN AND FOR THE MOMENT
7505-258958-0033 IF HE HAD NO MORE KNOWLEDGE MEMORY OR IMAGINATION THAN IS NECESSARY TO COMPARE GOODS HERE ONLY PRESENT GOODS COULD HAVE VALUE TO HIM EVEN THE HIGHER ANIMALS AND MUCH MORE THE SAVAGES
7505-258958-0034 TO BE USED BY A HUNGRY MAN FOR FOOD FOR A SHEEP TO BE KEPT FOR BREEDING OR FOR WOOL TO BE MADE INTO CLOTH NEXT YEAR HE MAY OVERLOOK THE DIFFERENCE IN THE GRADE OF WANTS COMPARED IN THIS CASE A GRATIFICATION
7505-258958-0035 OF THE PRESENT MOMENT IS COMPARED WITH A GRATIFICATION OF A VERY DIFFERENT KIND AT A FUTURE TIME THE PROBLEM INVOLVED IS COMPLEX BECAUSE OF DIFFERENCES IN TIME IN PLACE AND IN THE NATURE OF THE WANT GRATIFIERS
7505-258964-0000 HE MULTIPLIES MANY OTHERS WE HAVE NOTED MANY KINDS OF DEPRECIATION DESTRUCTION AND WEARING OUT OF WEALTH BUT THE NORMAL THING IN A HEALTHY SOCIETY IS AN INCREASE ON THE WHOLE OF RENT BEARERS
7505-258964-0001 THE INCREASE OF RENTS IS DUE TO TWO CAUSES CHANGES IN THE AGENTS BY WHICH THEY BECOME MORE EFFICIENT TECHNICALLY OR MORE NUMEROUS AND CHANGES TAKING PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE AGENTS
7505-258964-0002 AFFECTING THE UTILITY OF THE PRODUCTS THE FIRST OF THESE WILL BE CONSIDERED IN THIS SECTION THE INCREASE OF THE EFFICIENCY OF AGENTS IS USUALLY THE AIM OF THE INDIVIDUAL PRODUCER
7505-258964-0003 AND THUS IS BROUGHT ABOUT AN INCREASE OF THE STOCK OF WEALTH IN SOME CASES HOWEVER IMPROVEMENTS SUCH AS THE DREDGING OF HARBORS OR AS THE PROTECTING OF FORESTS ARE MADE BY MEN COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE AGENCY OF GOVERNMENTS
7505-258964-0004 SOMEWHERE HOWEVER THE DESIRE FOR THESE CHANGES MUST ARISE IN THE MINDS OF INDIVIDUALS INCREASE OF MOST THINGS INVOLVES COST OR SACRIFICE IN THE PSYCHOLOGICAL SENSE
7505-258964-0005 OTHER TRACTS LESS FERTILE OR FOR SOME REASON LESS AVAILABLE ARE DITCHED TILED AND DIKED AND FERTILIZERS ARE CARRIED UP STEEP HILLSIDES TO MAKE A SOIL UPON THE VERY CRAGS
7505-258964-0006 ENABLING THEM TO CARRY A GREATER AMOUNT OF FREIGHT WITHIN A YEAR
7505-258964-0007 THAT MAKE MACHINES STRONGER QUICKER AND BETTER THIS PROPOSITION IS NOT LOGICALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE PRECEDING A MACHINE IS AN ARRANGEMENT OF MATERIAL THINGS
7505-258964-0008 THROUGH WHICH FORCE MAY BE INDIRECTLY APPLIED TO MOVE MATTER NO FAST LINE DIVIDES MACHINERY AS REGARDS FORM PURPOSE OR CAUSE OF VALUE FROM THE ARTIFICIALLY IMPROVED NATURAL AGENTS
7505-258964-0009 THAT WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING JUST AS A FIELD IS DRAINED PLOWED AND CULTIVATED TO FIT IT BETTER TO YIELD A CROP SO IS THE IRON ORE SHAPED INTO A FORM
7505-258964-0010 IF THE QUALITY OR EFFICIENCY OF LOOMS IS DOUBLED IT IS AS IF THEIR NUMBER HAD GROWN IN LIKE PROPORTION IN ITS ECONOMIC FUNCTION THE BEAST OF BURDEN MAY NOT ILLOGICALLY BE CLASSED WITH INANIMATE MACHINES
7505-258964-0011 AND THERE WAS MUCH COMMENT ON THIS EVIDENCE OF A DECLINING INDUSTRY IT WAS NOT AT ONCE RECOGNIZED THAT THERE WAS EMBODIED IN HORSE FLESH MORE HORSE POWER THAN EVER BEFORE
7505-258964-0012 SO AS TO MAKE A MORE EFFICIENT AGENT AND MACHINES IN TURN MAY BE ADJUSTED AS PARTS OF A LARGER SYSTEM OF PRODUCTION THE IDEAL OF THE MODERN FACTORY SYSTEM IS SO TO ARRANGE THE MACHINERY
7505-258964-0013 THAT NO BIT OF MATERIAL WILL MAKE AN UNNECESSARY MOTION THE LOG ONCE STARTED THROUGH THE MILL IS CARRIED AUTOMATICALLY FROM ONE MACHINE TO ANOTHER UNTIL IT EMERGES AS A ROLL OF PAPER
7505-258964-0014 OR AS A BOX OF TOOTH PICKS READY FOR USE IN AN AMERICAN WATCH FACTORY ONE MAN TENDS TWELVE OR FIFTEEN AUTOMATIC MACHINES A SMALL BRASS ROD IS FED AUTOMATICALLY TO THE MACHINE
7505-258964-0015 WHERE IT IS READY FOR THE ASSEMBLING OF THE WATCH AS THE MACHINERY IMPROVES FACTORIES MAKING ALLIED PRODUCTS ARE GROUPED TO MAKE A SYSTEM STILL MORE EFFICIENT AS THE NUMBER OF AGENTS INCREASES
7505-258964-0016 THEY ARE DISTRIBUTED SO AS TO BE WHERE MOST USEFUL TO THE OWNER A MAN HAVING TWO UMBRELLAS KEEPS ONE AT HIS OFFICE AND THE OTHER AT HOME A STUDENT HAVING TWO BOOKS OF THE SAME KIND
7505-258964-0017 WHICH CAPTURE THE NATURAL FORCES OF THE WORLD PUT THEM INTO THE RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME AND MAKE THEM DO THE RIGHT THING OR WHICH GROUP AND RELATE THE MATERIALS OF THE WORLD IN THE RIGHT WAYS
7505-258964-0018 SOME OF THE GROUPINGS IN THE CHEMICAL AND PHYSICAL WORLD THAT DO NOT FIT MAN'S PURPOSES MAY BE MADE TO DO SO
7505-258964-0019 BUT IN DOING THAT HE AFFECTS THE AGENTS OWNED AND CONTROLLED BY OTHERS THE IDEAL FROM A SOCIAL STANDPOINT IS TO INCREASE NOT RENT BUT THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY
7505-258964-0020 AND THIS IS NOT ALWAYS THE IDEAL OF INDIVIDUALS SEEKING THEIR OWN INTEREST HOWEVER AS THE EFFICIENCY OF SOME AGENTS RISES IT BECOMES UNNECESSARY AND UNPROFITABLE TO USE THE LESS FERTILE FIELDS
7505-258964-0021 THEY CEASE TO BE RENT BEARERS AND THE RENT OF THE RICHER FIELDS FALLS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE NEW SUPPLY OF PRODUCTS SOME INVENTIONS SUDDENLY INCREASE THE EFFICIENCY OF FREE GOODS TO SUCH A DEGREE
7505-258964-0022 THAT THE LESS EFFICIENT RENTED AGENTS ARE THROWN OUT OF USE AND THE MARGIN OF UTILIZATION IS MOVED TO A HIGHER PLANE THAN IT WAS ON BEFORE IMPROVED TYPES OF MACHINERY MORE OR LESS RAPIDLY DISPLACE THE OLDER
7505-258964-0023 LESS EFFICIENT TYPES WHICH THEREFORE MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY LOSE THEIR RENT BEARING POWER LONG BEFORE THEY ARE PHYSICALLY WORN OUT
7505-258964-0024 WHEN IMPROVEMENTS IN AGRICULTURE THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO A CONSIDERABLE AREA OF LAND TAKE PLACE AND THE PRODUCT THUS IS INCREASED AND CHEAPENED THE POORER LAND IS ABANDONED
7505-258964-0025 AGENTS OF THE SAME KIND MAY DIMINISH IN NUMBER EITHER ABSOLUTELY OR RELATIVELY
7505-258964-0026 SUCH A LUCKY FIND HAS LIFTED THE MORTGAGE FROM A FARM IN EASTERN PENNSYLVANIA FROM WHICH IN TWO OR THREE YEARS HAS BEEN TAKEN FELDSPAR EXCEEDING IN VALUE THE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS
7505-258964-0027 OF THE SAME LAND IN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS THE DISCOVERY OF BUILDING STONE COAL NATURAL GAS OR OIL LAND MAY MAKE THE ANNUAL RENT OR ROYALTY
7505-258964-0028 OF LAND TENFOLD ITS FORMER TOTAL VALUE FITNESS TO PRODUCE NETTLES IS NOT ORDINARILY A VIRTUE IN LAND
7505-258964-0029 BUT THE DISCOVERY THAT CERTAIN FIELDS PRODUCE A SUPERIOR QUALITY OF THE NETTLE USED FOR HECKLING CLOTH CAUSES THEM TO TAKE ON A NEW VALUE A MINERAL SPRING BECAUSE OF THE
7505-258964-0030 MAY BE AS GOOD AS A MINE TO THE OWNER PECULIAR FITNESS FOR THE CULTIVATION OF CELERY MAY CONVERT MARSH LAND INTO A SUBSTANTIAL SOURCE OF INCOME
7505-258964-0031 SOCIAL CHANGES ARE CONSTANTLY CAUSING AGENTS TO SHIFT FROM LOWER TO HIGHER USES AS POPULATION GROWS AND GROUPS ABOUT NEW INDUSTRIES FARM LAND IS USED FOR RESIDENCE LOTS
7505-258964-0032 AND IN TURN FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES RENTS THEREFORE RISE AND THIS RISE IS REFLECTED IN THE HIGHER SELLING VALUE OF THE LAND IF A NEW DEMAND ARISES FOR THE PRODUCT OF ANY MACHINE
7505-258964-0033 ITS RENT RISES ALTHOUGH IT MAY CONTINUE TO TURN OUT THE SAME PRODUCT
7505-258964-0034 MAY BE RELATIVELY PERMANENT OR TEMPORARY BUSINESS CONDITIONS SOMETIMES CHANGE QUICKLY AN URGENT DEMAND FOR SPECIAL MACHINERY RAISES QUICKLY ITS RENT AND VALUE
7505-258964-0035 IT IS SAID THAT LACE MACHINERY IS SOMETIMES THROWN OUT OF USE FOR SEVERAL YEARS UNTIL A SUDDEN RENEWAL OF THE DEMAND FOR LACE CAUSES THE RENTAL TO EQUAL IN TWO YEARS
7505-258964-0036 MORE THAN THE ORIGINAL COST AT SUCH TIMES THE VALUE OF FACTORIES INCREASES GREATLY BUT AFTER A FEW YEARS OF PROSPERITY BUSINESS AGAIN COLLAPSES
7505-258964-0037 SUCH PROSPEROUS PERIODS ARE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THE BUSINESS MAN AND OF THE PROMOTER TO SELL THE FACTORY AT ITS HIGHEST PRICE MACHINERY ADAPTED ONLY FOR A SPECIAL PRODUCT
7505-258964-0038 WILL NOT SELL AS READILY WHEN LESS NEEDED FOR ITS SPECIAL USE AS THAT WHICH LIKE A TURNING LATHE CAN BE USED FOR MANY PURPOSES BUT THE MORE SPECIAL THE APPLIANCES NEEDED FOR A CERTAIN PRODUCT THE HIGHER
7505-258964-0039 MORE ABNORMAL WILL BE THEIR TEMPORARY VALUE WHEN THEY ARE SUDDENLY NEEDED LAND NEAR THE SITE OF AN EXPOSITION TAKES ON A VERY
7505-258964-0040 PUTS A CHECK OR SETS A LIMIT TO THE RISE IN THIS SEARCH FOR NEW DEVICES THE MAN WHO CAN SEE MOST QUICKLY AND CLEARLY HAS A KEY TO WEALTH
7505-258964-0041 SOME KINDS OF AGENTS AS RARE MINERALS OR TOOLS THAT CAN BE PRODUCED ONLY BY HIGHLY SKILLED LABOR CANNOT BE INCREASED RAPIDLY IN NUMBER AND REMAIN HIGH IN PRICE FOR A LONG PERIOD
7505-258964-0042 AND FAVORABLY LOCATED BUILDING SITES ILLUSTRATE THE SAME PRINCIPLE IN SOME CASES IT IS TRUE THE DEMAND MAY BE DUE TO SOME TEMPORARY CAUSE
7505-258964-0043 WATERWORKS GAS WORKS STREET RAILWAYS FERRIES AND WHARVES THIS EVIDENTLY IS ONLY A SPECIAL ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLE JUST STATED WHERE IT IS NOT EASY TO FIND A SUBSTITUTE FOR CERTAIN AGENTS
7505-258964-0044 PUBLIC FRANCHISES ENTITLE THE OWNERS TO SPECIAL SOMETIMES EXCLUSIVE PRIVILEGES AND PROTECT THEM LEGALLY FROM COMPETITION NOT ALL FRANCHISES ARE VALUABLE
7505-258964-0045 MANY STREET RAILWAYS ARE UNFORTUNATE VENTURES THE EARNINGS BEING INSUFFICIENT TO PAY EXPENSES TO SAY NOTHING OF INTEREST ON THE INVESTMENT BUT WHEN THEY PAY GREATLY
7505-258964-0046 THEIR HIGH VALUE IS DUE TO THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF COMPETITION THE CARS MULES DYNAMOS STEAM ENGINES
7505-258964-0047 DUE TO ACCIDENTAL AND SOCIAL CAUSES RAISING THE RENTS OF WEALTH THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT MAY BE DEFINED AS AN INCREASE IN RENTS OR VALUE OF AGENTS
7505-258964-0048 DUE TO SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE EFFORTS OR MERITS OF THE OWNER IN FACT IT IS THAT OF WHICH WE HAVE BEEN SPEAKING IN SOME CASES POWERFUL OR WEALTHY MEN
7505-258964-0049 CAN BRING ABOUT SOCIAL CHANGES IN ENTIRELY LEGITIMATE WAYS THE OWNER OF A LARGE FACTORY MOVING IT INTO THE COUNTRY MAY BUY UP SURROUNDING LAND AND FOUND A CITY CONVERTING PASTURE LANDS AND CORN FIELDS
7505-258964-0050 IS POWERLESS TO AFFECT THE RESULT HE CAN ONLY ADAPT HIS CONDUCT IN SOME MEASURE SO AS TO REAP AN ADVANTAGE HE CAN STRIVE TO INCREASE THE NUMBER AND QUALITY
7505-258964-0051 AS WELL AS OF GAIN THE TERM UNEARNED INCREMENT HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY USED IN RECENT YEARS
7505-83618-0000 THEIR CULTURE MYTH WHICH HE HAS RECORDED
7505-83618-0001 THE BLOOD GUSHED FROM HIM AT EVERY STEP AND AS IT FELL TURNED INTO FLINT STONES THE VICTOR RETURNED TO HIS GRANDMOTHER AND ESTABLISHED HIS LODGE IN THE FAR EAST ON THE BORDERS OF THE GREAT OCEAN WHENCE THE SUN COMES IN TIME HE BECAME THE FATHER OF MANKIND
7505-83618-0002 OF THE EARLY NATIVE TRADITIONS SO STRONG IS THE RESEMBLANCE IOSKEHA BEARS TO MICHABO THAT WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IN EXPLANATION OF THE LATTER WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR BOTH
7505-83618-0003 YET I DO NOT IMAGINE THAT THE ONE WAS COPIED OR BORROWED FROM THE OTHER WE CANNOT BE TOO CAUTIOUS IN ADOPTING SUCH A CONCLUSION THE TWO NATIONS WERE REMOTE IN EVERYTHING BUT GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION
7505-83618-0004 I CALL TO MIND ANOTHER SIMILAR MYTH IN IT A MOTHER IS ALSO SAID TO HAVE BROUGHT FORTH TWINS OR A PAIR OF TWINS AND TO HAVE PAID FOR THEM WITH HER LIFE AGAIN THE ONE IS DESCRIBED AS THE BRIGHT
7505-83618-0005 SCHOLARS LIKEWISE HAVE INTERPRETED THE MOTHER TO MEAN THE DAWN THE TWINS EITHER LIGHT AND DARKNESS OR THE FOUR WINDS YET THIS IS NOT ALGONKIN THEOLOGY NOR IS IT AT ALL RELATED TO THAT OF THE IROQUOIS
7505-83618-0006 IT IS THE STORY OF SARAMA IN THE RIG VEDA AND WAS WRITTEN IN SANSCRIT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE HIMALAYAS CENTURIES BEFORE HOMER SUCH UNIFORMITY POINTS NOT TO A COMMON SOURCE IN HISTORY
7505-83618-0007 BUT IN PSYCHOLOGY MAN CHIEFLY COGNIZANT OF HIS SOUL THROUGH HIS SENSES THOUGHT WITH AN AWFUL HORROR OF THE NIGHT WHICH DEPRIVED HIM OF THE USE OF ONE AND FORESHADOWED THE LOSS OF ALL THEREFORE
7505-83618-0008 LIGHT AND LIFE WERE TO HIM SYNONYMOUS THEREFORE ALL RELIGIONS PROMISE TO LEAD FROM NIGHT TO LIGHT FROM NIGHT TO HEAVENLY LIGHT THEREFORE HE WHO RESCUES IS EVER THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD
7505-83618-0009 A MESSIAH FAIRER THAN THE CHILDREN OF MEN FULFILLED IN THAT DAY WHEN HE APPEARED IN GARMENTS SO WHITE AS NO FULLER ON EARTH COULD WHITE THEM
7505-83618-0010 LANGUAGE ITSELF IS PROOF OF IT MANY ALGONKIN WORDS FOR EAST MORNING DAWN DAY LIGHT
7505-83618-0011 ARE DERIVED FROM A RADICAL SIGNIFYING WHITE
7505-83618-0012 BUT PACHACAMA ATTACKED AND DROVE HIM TO THE NORTH IRRITATED AT HIS DEFEAT HE TOOK WITH HIM THE RAIN AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THIS DAY THE SEA COAST OF PERU IS LARGELY AN ARID DESERT NOW WHEN WE ARE INFORMED THAT THE SOUTH WIND
7505-83618-0013 FOR ASKED THE INCAS
7505-83618-0014 FOR HE WAS ATTACKED WITH MURDEROUS INTENT BY THE BEINGS WHOM HE HAD CREATED WHEN HOWEVER SCORNING SUCH UNEQUAL COMBAT HE HAD MANIFESTED HIS POWER BY HURLING THE LIGHTNING ON THE HILL SIDES AND CONSUMING THE FORESTS
7505-83618-0015 THEY RECOGNIZED THEIR MAKER AND HUMBLED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE WAS RECONCILED AND TAUGHT THEM ARTS AND AGRICULTURE INSTITUTIONS AND RELIGION MERITING THE TITLE THEY GAVE HIM OF PACHAYACHACHIC
7505-83618-0016 TEACHER OF ALL THINGS AT LAST HE DISAPPEARED IN THE WESTERN OCEAN FOUR PERSONAGES COMPANIONS OR SONS WERE CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH HIM
7505-83618-0017 TO A THIRD THE EAST TO A FOURTH THE WEST
7505-83618-0018 AND THAT OF MICHABO BOTH PRECEDE AND CREATE THE SUN BOTH JOURNEY TO THE WEST OVERCOMING OPPOSITION WITH THE THUNDERBOLT BOTH DIVIDE THE WORLD BETWEEN THE FOUR WINDS BOTH WERE THE FATHERS GODS AND TEACHERS OF THEIR NATIONS
7505-83618-0019 NOR DOES IT CEASE HERE MICHABO I HAVE SHOWN IS THE WHITE SPIRIT OF THE DAWN VIRACOCHA ALL AUTHORITIES TRANSLATE
7505-83618-0020 FOR HIS HIGH PRIEST ALWAYS BORE HIS NAME BUT HE HIMSELF IS A PURE CREATION OF THE FANCY AND ALL HIS ALLEGED HISTORY IS NOTHING BUT A MYTH HIS EMBLEMATIC NAME THE BIRD SERPENT AND HIS REBUS AND CROSS AT
7505-83618-0021 I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED OTHERS OF HIS TITLES WERE
7505-83618-0022 YOLCUAT THE RATTLESNAKE TOHIL THE RUMBLER HUEMAC THE STRONG HAND
7505-83618-0023 THE SAME DUALISM REAPPEARS IN HIM THAT HAS BEEN NOTED IN HIS ANALOGUES ELSEWHERE HE IS BOTH LORD OF THE EASTERN LIGHT AND THE WINDS AS THE FORMER HE WAS BORN OF A VIRGIN IN THE LAND OF TULA OR TLAPALLAN IN THE DISTANT ORIENT
7505-83618-0024 HE WAS FIGURATIVELY SAID TO SWEEP THE ROAD FOR HIM SINCE IN THAT COUNTRY VIOLENT WINDS ARE THE PRECURSORS OF THE WET SEASONS WHEREVER HE WENT ALL MANNER OF SINGING BIRDS BORE HIM COMPANY EMBLEMS OF THE WHISTLING BREEZES
7505-83618-0025 THE HILL OF SHOUTING WITH SUCH A MIGHTY VOICE THAT IT COULD BE HEARD A HUNDRED LEAGUES AROUND THE ARROWS WHICH HE SHOT TRANSFIXED GREAT TREES THE STONES HE THREW LEVELLED FORESTS
7505-83618-0026 AND WHEN HE LAID HIS HANDS ON THE ROCKS THE MARK WAS INDELIBLE YET AS THUS EMBLEMATIC OF THE THUNDER STORM HE POSSESSED IN FULL MEASURE
7511-102419-0000 CAMP CLOUDCREST SEPTEMBER TWELFTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY
7511-102419-0001 BUT I'VE A CHANCE TO DAY SO I WILL NOT LET IT PASS UNUSED WE ARE IN THE LAST CAMP RIGHT ON THE HUNTING GROUND IN THE MIDST OF THE FRAY WE HAVE SAID GOOD BYE TO DEAR ELIZABETH AND I MUST TELL YOU ABOUT HER BECAUSE SHE REALLY COMES FIRST
7511-102419-0002 TO BEGIN WITH THE MORNING WE LEFT THE HOLTS ELIZABETH SUGGESTED THAT WE THREE WOMEN RIDE IN THE BUCKBOARD SO I SEATED MYSELF ON A ROLL OF BEDDING IN THE BACK PART
7511-102419-0003 THE SKY WAS CLEAR BLUE
7511-102419-0004 THE MOUNTAINS ON ONE SIDE WERE CRESTED GREAT CRAGS AND PILES OF ROCK CROWNED THEM AS FAR AS WE COULD SEE TIMBER GREW ONLY ABOUT HALFWAY UP THE TRUNKS OF THE QUAKING ASPENS SHONE SILVERY IN THE EARLY SUNLIGHT AND THEIR LEAVES WERE SHIMMERING GOLD
7511-102419-0005 AND THE STATELY PINES KEPT WHISPERING AND MURMURING IT ALMOST SEEMED AS IF THEY WERE CHIDING THE QUAKING ASPENS FOR BEING FRIVOLOUS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROAD LAY THE RIVER BORDERED BY WILLOWS AND GRASSY FLATS
7511-102419-0006 THERE WERE MANY SMALL LAKES AND THE DUCKS AND GEESE WERE NOISILY ENJOYING THEMSELVES AMONG THE RUSHES AND WATER GRASSES BEYOND THE RIVER ROSE THE FOREST COVERED MOUNTAINS HILL UPON HILL ELIZABETH DRESSED WITH ESPECIAL CARE THAT MORNING
7511-102419-0007 AND VERY PRETTY SHE LOOKED IN HER NEAT SHEPHERD'S PLAID SUIT AND NATTY LITTLE WHITE CANVAS HAT VERY SOON SHE SAID I HOPE NEITHER OF YOU WILL MISUNDERSTAND ME WHEN I TELL YOU THAT IF MY HOPES ARE REALIZED I WILL NOT RIDE WITH YOU MUCH LONGER
7511-102419-0008 I NEVER SAW SUCH A COUNTRY AS THE WEST
7511-102419-0009 AND I NEVER SAW SUCH PEOPLE YOU ARE JUST LIKE YOUR COUNTRY YOU HAVE FED ME CARED FOR ME AND BEFRIENDED ME A STRANGER
7511-102419-0010 MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY SAID TUT TUT TIS NOTHING AT ALL WE'VE DONE TIS A COMFORT YOU'VE BEEN HASN'T SHE MISSUS STEWART I COULD HEARTILY AGREE AND ELIZABETH WENT ON THE WAY I HAVE BEEN RECEIVED AND THE WAY WE ALL TREATED MISSUS HOLT
7511-102419-0011 WILL BE THE GREATEST HELP TO ME IN BECOMING WHAT I HOPE TO BECOME A REAL WESTERNER I MIGHT HAVE LIVED A LONG TIME IN THE WEST AND NOT HAVE UNDERSTOOD MANY THINGS IF I HAD NOT FALLEN INTO YOUR HANDS YEARS AGO
7511-102419-0012 BEFORE I WAS THROUGH SCHOOL I WAS TO HAVE BEEN MARRIED BUT I LOST MY MOTHER JUST THEN AND WAS LEFT THE CARE OF MY PARALYTIC FATHER IF I HAD MARRIED THEN I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO TAKE FATHER FROM HIS FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS BECAUSE WALLACE CAME WEST IN THE FORESTRY SERVICE
7511-102419-0013 I FELT THAT IT WOULDN'T BE RIGHT POOR FATHER COULDN'T SPEAK BUT HIS EYES TOLD ME HOW GRATEFUL HE WAS TO STAY WE HAD OUR LITTLE HOME AND FATHER HAD HIS PENSION AND I WAS ABLE TO GET A SMALL SCHOOL NEAR US
7511-102419-0014 I COULD TAKE CARE OF FATHER AND TEACH ALSO WE WERE VERY COMFORTABLY SITUATED AND IN TIME BECAME REALLY HAPPY ALTHOUGH I SELDOM HEARD FROM WALLACE HIS LETTERS WERE WELL WORTH WAITING FOR AND I KNEW HE WAS DOING WELL
7511-102419-0015 EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO FATHER DIED GENTLY WENT TO SLEEP I WAITED SIX MONTHS AND THEN WROTE TO WALLACE BUT RECEIVED NO REPLY
7511-102419-0016 I COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER AND HAVE COME TO SEE WHAT HAS BECOME OF HIM IF HE IS DEAD MAY I STAY ON WITH ONE OF YOU AND PERHAPS GET A SCHOOL I WANT TO LIVE HERE ALWAYS BUT DARLINT SAID MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY
7511-102419-0017 SUPPOSIN IT'S MARRIED YOUR MAN IS WALLACE MAY HAVE CHANGED HIS MIND ABOUT ME BUT HE WOULD NOT MARRY WITHOUT TELLING ME IF HE IS ALIVE HE IS HONORABLE THEN I ASKED
7511-102419-0018 IF HE IS STATIONED IN THE BRIDGES RESERVE THEY WOULD BE SURE TO KNOW OF HIM AT ANY OF THESE LITTLE PLACES I JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO I SHOULD NEVER HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT I HAVE ONLY I THINK I OWE IT TO YOU AND IT WAS EASIER BECAUSE OF THE HOLTS
7511-102419-0019 I AM SO GLAD WE MET THEM SO WE DROVE ALONG TALKING TOGETHER WE EACH ASSURED THE GIRL OF OUR ENTIRE WILLINGNESS TO HAVE HER AS A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY AFTER A WHILE I GOT ON TO THE WAGON WITH MISTER STEWART AND TOLD HIM ELIZABETH'S STORY
7511-102419-0020 AND WE HELD OUR BREATH UNTIL WE EMERGED ON THE OTHER SIDE MISTER SORENSON IS A VERY CAPABLE AND CONSCIENTIOUS GAME WARDEN AND A VERY GENIAL GENTLEMAN HE RODE DOWN TO MEET US
7511-102419-0021 TO INSPECT OUR LICENSE AND TO TELL US ABOUT OUR PRIVILEGES AND OUR DUTIES AS GOOD WOODSMEN HE ALSO ISSUES LICENSES IN CASE HUNTERS HAVE NEGLECTED TO SECURE THEM BEFORE COMING MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAD REFUSED TO GET A LICENSE WHEN WE DID
7511-102419-0022 SHE SAID SHE WAS NOT GOING TO HUNT SHE TOLD US WE COULD GIVE HER A SMALL PIECE OF ILK AND THAT WOULD DO SO WE WERE RATHER SURPRISED WHEN SHE PURCHASED TWO LICENSES ONE A SPECIAL WHICH WOULD ENTITLE HER TO A BULL ELK
7511-102419-0023 AS WE WERE STARTING MISTER STEWART ASKED THE GAME WARDEN CAN YOU TELL ME IF WALLACE WHITE IS STILL STATIONED HERE OH YES MISTER SORENSON SAID WALLACE'S PLACE IS ONLY A FEW MILES UP THE RIVER AND CAN BE PLAINLY SEEN FROM THE ROAD WE DROVE ON
7511-102419-0024 HAPPINESS HAD TAKEN A NEW CLUTCH UPON MY HEART I LOOKED BACK EXPECTING TO SEE ELIZABETH ALL SMILES BUT IF YOU WILL BELIEVE ME THE FOOLISH GIRL WAS SOBBING AS IF HER HEART WAS BROKEN MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY DREW HER HEAD DOWN UPON HER SHOULDER
7511-102419-0025 AND WAS TRYING TO QUIET HER THE ROAD ALONG THERE WAS VERY ROUGH STAYING ON THE WAGON OCCUPIED ALL MY ATTENTION FOR A WHILE SEVERAL MILES WERE PASSED WHEN WE CAME IN SIGHT OF A BEAUTIFUL CABIN HALF HIDDEN IN A GROVE OF PINES BEYOND THE RIVER
7511-102419-0026 MISTER STEWART SAID WE MIGHT AS WELL NOON AS SOON AS WE CAME TO A GOOD PLACE AND THEN HE WOULD RIDE ACROSS AND SEE MISTER WHITE JUST AS WE ROUNDED THE HILL A HORSEMAN CAME TOWARD US A SPLENDID FELLOW HE WAS
7511-102419-0027 MANLY STRENGTH AND GRACE SHOWING IN EVERY LINE THE ROAD WAS NARROW AGAINST THE HILLSIDE AND HE HAD TO RIDE QUITE CLOSE SO I SAW HIS HANDSOME FACE PLAINLY AS SOON AS HE SAW ELIZABETH HE SPRANG FROM HIS SADDLE AND SAID LIZ'BETH LIZ'BETH
7511-102419-0028 SHE HELD HER HANDS TO HIM AND SAID OH JUST RIDING WITH FRIENDS THEN TO MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY SHE SAID THIS IS MY WALLACE MISTER STEWART IS THE QUEEREST MAN
7511-102419-0029 INSTEAD OF LETTING ME ENJOY THE TABLEAU HE SOLEMNLY DROVE ON SAYING HE WOULD NOT WANT ANY ONE GAWKING AT HIM IF HE WERE THE HAPPY MAN ANYWAY HE COULDN'T URGE CHUB FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT MY SEEING AND HEARING WHAT I'VE TOLD YOU
7511-102419-0030 BESIDES THAT I SAW THAT ELIZABETH'S HAT WAS ON AWRY HER HAIR IN DISORDER AND HER EYES RED IT WAS DISAPPOINTING AFTER SHE HAD BEEN SO CAREFUL TO LOOK NICELY MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY CAME TROTTING ALONG AND WE STOPPED FOR DINNER
7511-102419-0031 WE HAD JUST GOT THE COFFEE BOILING WHEN THE LOVERS CAME UP ELIZABETH IN THE SADDLE LEARNING TO RIDE AND HE WALKING BESIDE HER HOLDING HER HAND HOW HAPPY THEY WERE THE REST OF US WERE MIGHTY NEAR AS FOOLISH AS THEY
7511-102419-0032 THEY WERE GOING TO START IMMEDIATELY AFTER DINNER ON HORSEBACK FOR THE COUNTY SEAT TO BE MARRIED AFTER WE HAD EATEN ELIZABETH SELECTED A FEW THINGS FROM HER TRUNK AND MISTER STEWART AND MISTER WHITE DROVE THE BUCKBOARD ACROSS THE RIVER TO LEAVE THE TRUNK IN ITS NEW HOME
7511-102419-0033 WHILE THEY WERE GONE WE HELPED ELIZABETH TO DRESS ALL THE WHILE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY WAS ADMONISHING HER TO NAME HER FIRST GIRUL MARY ELLEN OR SHE SAID
7511-102419-0034 WHICH WAS ME NAME BEFORE I WAS MARRIED TO ME MAN GOD REST HIS SOUL DEAR ELIZABETH SHE WAS GLAD TO GET AWAY I SUSPECT SHE AND HER WALLACE MADE A FINE COUPLE AS THEY RODE AWAY IN THE GOLDEN SEPTEMBER AFTERNOON
7511-102419-0035 I BELIEVE SHE IS ONE HAPPY BRIDE THAT THE SUN SHONE ON IF THE OMEN HAS FAILED EVERYWHERE ELSE WELL WE FELT POWERFULLY REDUCED IN NUMBERS BUT ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK THAT AFTERNOON WE CAME UPON MISTER STRUBLE AND MISTER HAYNES
7511-102419-0036 WAITING BESIDE THE ROAD FOR US THEY HAD COME TO PILOT US INTO CAMP FOR THERE WOULD BE NO ROAD SOON SUCH A WAY AS WE CAME OVER SUCH JOLTING AND SLIDING I BEGGED TO GET OFF AND WALK
7511-102419-0037 BUT AS THE WHOLE WAY WAS CARPETED BY STRAWBERRY VINES AND THERE WERE LATE BERRIES TO TEMPT ME TO LOITER I HAD TO STAY ON THE WAGON I HAD NO IDEA A WAGON COULD BE GOT ACROSS SUCH PLACES MISTER STRUBLE DROVE FOR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY
7511-102419-0038 AND I COULD HEAR HER IMPLORING ALL THE SAINTS TO PRESERVE US FROM INSTANT DEATH I KEPT SHUTTING MY EYES TRYING NOT TO SEE THE TERRIFYING PLACES AND OPENING THEM AGAIN TO SEE THE BEAUTY SPREAD EVERYWHERE UNTIL MISTER STEWART SAID
7511-102419-0039 IT MUST MAKE YOU NERVOUS TO RIDE OVER MOUNTAIN ROADS DON'T BAT YOUR EYES SO FAST AND YOU'LL SEE MORE SO THEN I STIFFENED MY BACK AND KEPT MY EYES OPEN AND I DID SEE MORE IT HAD BEEN DECIDED TO GO AS FAR AS WE COULD WITH THE WAGONS AND THEN SET CAMP
7511-102419-0040 FROM THERE THE HUNTERS WOULD RIDE HORSEBACK AS FAR UP AS THEY COULD AND THEN CLIMB IT WAS ALMOST SUNDOWN WHEN WE REACHED CAMP ALL THE HUNTERS WERE IN AND SUCH A YOWLING AS THEY SET UP
7511-102419-0041 LOOK WHO'S HERE SEE WHO'S COME THEY YELLED THEY WENT TO WORK SETTING UP TENTS AND UNLOADING WAGONS WITH A HEARTY GOOD WILL WE ARE CAMPED JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE PINES BACK OF US RISES A BIG PINE CLAD MOUNTAIN
7511-102419-0042 OUR TENTS ARE SET UNDER SOME BIG TREES ON A SMALL PLATEAU AND RIGHT BELOW US IS A VALLEY IN WHICH GRASS GROWS KNEE HIGH AND LITTLE STREAMS COME FROM EVERY WAY TROUT SCURRY UP STREAM WHENEVER WE GO NEAR
7511-102419-0043 WE CALL THE VALLEY PARADISE VALLEY BECAUSE IT IS THE HORSES PARADISE AND AS IN THE EARLY MORNING WE CAN OFTEN SEE CLOUDS ROLLING ALONG THE VALLEY WE CALL OUR CAMP CLOUDCREST WE HAVE A BEAUTIFUL PLACE IT IS WELL SHELTERED
7511-102419-0044 THERE IS PLENTY OF WOOD WATER AND FEED AND LOOKING EASTWARD DOWN THE VALLEY SNOW COVERED CRAG TOPPED MOUNTAINS DELIGHT THE EYE THE AIR IS SO BRACING THAT WE ALL FEEL EQUAL TO ANYTHING
7511-102419-0045 MISTER STRUBLE HAS ALREADY KILLED A FINE SPIKE ELK FOR CAMP EATING WE CAMPED IN A BUNCH AND WE HAVE CAMP STOVES SO THAT IN CASE OF RAIN OR SNOW WE CAN STAY INDOORS JUST NOW WE HAVE A HUGE CAMP FIRE
7511-102419-0046 AROUND WHICH WE SIT IN THE EVENING TELLING STORIES SINGING AND EATING NUTS OF THE PINON PINE THEN TOO THE WHOLE COUNTRY IS FILLED WITH THOSE TINY LITTLE STRAWBERRIES WE HAVE TO GATHER ALL DAY TO GET AS MUCH AS WE CAN EAT
7511-102419-0047 BUT THEY ARE DELICIOUS YESTERDAY WE HAD PIE MADE OF WILD CURRANTS THERE ARE A POWERFUL LOT OF THEM HERE THERE IS ALSO A LITTLE BLUEBERRY THAT THE MEN SAY IS THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN HUCKLEBERRY THE GROUSE ARE FEEDING ON THEM
7511-102419-0048 ALTOGETHER THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PLACES IMAGINABLE THE MEN ARE NOT VERY ANXIOUS TO BEGIN HUNTING A LITTLE DELAY MEANS COOLER WEATHER FOR THE MEAT IT IS COOL UP HERE BUT GOING BACK ACROSS THE DESERT IT WILL BE WARM FOR A WHILE YET STILL
7511-102419-0049 WHEN THEY SEE ELK EVERY DAY IT IS A GREAT TEMPTATION TO TRY A SHOT ONE OF THE STUDENTS TOLD ME PROFESSOR GLENHOLDT WAS HERE TO GET THE TIP END BONE OF THE TAIL OF A BRONTOSAURUS
7511-102419-0050 AS HE HAD HEARD THEY WERE FINE EATING HAVING STRATA OF FAT ALTERNATING WITH STRATA OF LEAN MISTER HAYNES IS A QUIET FELLOW JUST INTERESTED IN HUNTING MISTER STRUBLE IS THE BIG MAN OF THE PARTY
7511-102419-0051 HE IS TALL AND STRONG AND WE FIND HIM VERY PLEASANT COMPANY THEN THERE IS DOCTOR TESCHALL HE IS A QUIET FELLOW WITH AN UNEXPECTED SMILE HE IS SO RESERVED THAT I FELT THAT HE WAS KIND OF OUT OF PLACE AMONG THE REST UNTIL I CAUGHT HIS CORDIAL SMILE
7511-102419-0052 NOT TO MENTION CARRYING THE HEAVY GUN THEY ARE USING THE LARGEST CALIBER SPORTING GUNS MURDEROUS LOOKING THINGS THAT IS ALL EXCEPT MISTER HARKRUDDER THE PICTURE MAN
7511-102419-0053 HE LOOKS TO BE ABOUT FORTY YEARS OLD BUT WHOOPS AND LAUGHS LIKE HE WAS ABOUT TEN I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU OF THE GOOD MON DO I HE IS JUST THE KIND QUIET GOOD MON THAT HE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SINCE I HAVE KNOWN HIM
7511-102419-0054 HE TOLD MISTER HAYNES HE WAS TOO TAM SEEK IN DE BEL SO WE HAD TO COME WITHOUT HIM
7511-102419-0055 AND ARE ALL WILLING TO HELP I DON'T THINK I SHALL BE ABLE TO TELL YOU OF ANY GREAT EXPLOITS I MAKE WITH THE GUN I FIRED ONE THAT MISTER STEWART CARRIES AND IT ALMOST KICKED MY SHOULDER OFF I AM MYSTIFIED ABOUT MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S LICENSE
7511-102419-0056 I KNOW SHE WOULD NOT SHOOT ONE OF THOSE BIG GUNS FOR A DOZEN ELK BESIDES THAT SHE IS VERY TENDER HEARTED AND WILL NEVER HARM ANYTHING HERSELF ALTHOUGH SHE LIKES TO JOIN OUR HUNTS I THINK YOU MUST BE TIRED OF THIS LETTER SO I AM GOING TO SAY GOOD NIGHT MY FRIEND
7511-102420-0000 CAMP CLOUDCREST OCTOBER SIXTH NINETEEN FOURTEEN DEAR MISSUS CONEY IT SEEMS SO ODD TO BE WRITING YOU AND GETTING NO ANSWERS
7511-102420-0001 I HAVEN'T ONE THING I TOLD HER I OWED YOU MORE LOVE THAN I COULD EVER PAY IN A LIFETIME AND SHE SAID WRITING SUCH LONG LETTERS IS A MIGHTY POOR WAY TO SHOW IT I HAVE BEEN NEGLECTING YOU SHAMEFULLY I THINK
7511-102420-0002 ONE OF THE MAIN REASONS I CAME ON THIS HUNT WAS TO TAKE THE TRIP FOR YOU AND TO TELL YOU THINGS THAT YOU WOULD MOST ENJOY SO I WILL SPEND THIS SNOWY DAY IN WRITING TO YOU ON THE NIGHT OF SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH THERE WAS THE MOST AWFUL THUNDERSTORM I EVER WITNESSED
7511-102420-0003 FLASH AFTER FLASH OF THE MOST BLINDING LIGHTNING FOLLOWED BY DEAFENING PEALS OF THUNDER AND AS IT ECHOED FROM MOUNTAIN TO MOUNTAIN THE UPROAR WAS TERRIFYING I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED A STORM THE BEAT OF HAIL AND RAIN AND THE ROAR OF WIND
7511-102420-0004 ALWAYS APPEAL TO ME BUT THERE WAS NEITHER WIND NOR RAIN JUST FLASH AND ROAR BEFORE THE ECHO DIED AWAY AMONG THE HILLS ANOTHER BOOMING REPORT WOULD SEEM TO SHIVER THE ATMOSPHERE AND SET ALL OUR TINWARE JANGLING
7511-102420-0005 WE ARE CAMPED SO NEAR THE GREAT PINES THAT I WILL CONFESS I WAS POWERFULLY AFRAID HAD THE LIGHTNING STRUCK ONE OF THE BIG PINES THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ONE OF US LEFT I COULD HEAR MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MURMURING HER PRAYERS WHEN THERE WAS A LULL
7511-102420-0006 WE HAD GONE TO BED BUT I COULDN'T REMAIN THERE SO I SAT ON THE WAGON SEAT WITH JERRINE BESIDE ME SOMETHING STRUCK THE GUY ROPES OF THE TENT AND I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WAS TOO WEAK TO CRY OUT I THOUGHT THE BIG TREE MUST HAVE FALLEN
7511-102420-0007 IN THE LULLS OF THE STORM I COULD HEAR THE MEN'S VOICES HIGH AND EXCITED THEY TOO WERE UP IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE STORM LASTED FOR HOURS BUT AT LAST IT MOVED OFF UP THE VALLEY THE FLASHES GREW TO BE A MERE GLIMMER
7511-102420-0008 AND THE THUNDER MERE RUMBLING THE PINES BEGAN TO MOAN AND SOON A LITTLE BREEZE WHISTLED BY SO WE LAY DOWN AGAIN NEXT MORNING THE HORSES COULD NOT BE FOUND THE STORM HAD FRIGHTENED THEM AND THEY HAD TRIED TO GO HOME
7511-102420-0009 THE MEN HAD TO FIND THEM AND AS IT TOOK MOST OF THE DAY WE HAD TO PUT OFF OUR HUNT WE WERE UP AND ABOUT NEXT MORNING IN THE FIRST FAINT GRAY LIGHT WHILE THE MEN FED GRAIN TO THE HORSES AND SADDLED THEM WE PREPARED A HASTY BREAKFAST
7511-102420-0010 WE WERE OFF BEFORE IT WAS MORE THAN LIGHT ENOUGH FOR US TO SEE THE TRAIL DAWN IN THE MOUNTAINS HOW I WISH I COULD DESCRIBE IT TO YOU IF I COULD ONLY MAKE YOU FEEL THE KEEN BRACING AIR THE EXHILARATING CLIMB
7511-102420-0011 GREENISH AMBER LIGHT AND A BLUE GRAY SKY FAR AHEAD OF US WE COULD SEE THE RED RIM ROCK OF A MOUNTAIN ABOVE TIMBER LINE THE FIRST RAYS OF THE SUN TURNED THE JAGGED PEAKS INTO GOLDEN POINTS OF A CROWN IN OKLAHOMA
7511-102420-0012 EVEN AT THIS SEASON BUT HERE THERE ARE NO SONG BIRDS AND ONLY THE SNAPPING OF TWIGS AS OUR HORSES CLIMBED THE FROSTY TRAIL BROKE THE SILENCE WE HAD BEEN CAUTIONED NOT TO TALK BUT NEITHER MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY NOR I WANTED TO
7511-102420-0013 THE SUN WAS WELL UP WHEN WE REACHED THE LITTLE PARK WHERE WE PICKETED OUR HORSES THEN CAME A LONG HARD CLIMB IT IS HARD CLIMBING AT THE BEST AND WHEN THERE IS A BIG GUN TO CARRY IT IS VERY HARD
7511-102420-0014 THEN TOO WE HAD TO KEEP UP WITH THE MEN AND WE DIDN'T FIND THAT EASY TO DO AT LAST WE REACHED THE TOP AND SAT DOWN ON SOME BOULDERS TO REST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE WE STARTED DOWN TO THE HUNTING GROUND WHICH LAY IN A CUPLIKE VALLEY FAR BELOW US
7511-102420-0015 WE COULD HEAR THE ROAR OF THE GROS VENTRE AS IT TUMBLED GRUMBLINGLY OVER ITS ROCKY BED TO OUR RIGHT ROSE MILE AFTER MILE OF RED CLIFFS AS THE LAST OF THE QUAKING ASP LEAVES HAVE FALLEN THERE WERE NO GOLDEN GROVES
7511-102420-0016 IN THEIR PLACES STOOD SILVERY PATCHES AGAINST THE RED BACKGROUND OF THE CLIFFS HIGH OVERHEAD A TRIANGLE OF WILD GEESE HARROWED THE BLUE SKY I WAS PLUMB OUT OF BREATH BUT MEN WHO ARE MOST GALLANT ELSEWHERE ARE
7511-102420-0017 ABSOLUTELY HEARTLESS ON A HUNT I WAS SCARCELY THROUGH PANTING BEFORE WE BEGAN TO DESCEND WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTIONS AS TO HOW WE SHOULD MOVE SO AS TO KEEP OUT OF RANGE OF EACH OTHER'S GUNS THEN MISTER HAYNES AND MYSELF STARTED ONE WAY
7511-102420-0018 AND MISTER STRUBLE AND MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY THE OTHER WE WERE TO MEET WHERE THE VALLEY TERMINATED IN A BROAD PASS WE FELT SURE WE COULD GET A CHANCE AT WHAT ELK THERE MIGHT BE IN THE VALLEY WE WERE FOLLOWING FRESH TRACKS AND A LITTLE OF THE HUNTER'S ENTHUSIASM SEIZED ME
7511-102420-0019 WE HAD NOT FOLLOWED THEM FAR WHEN THREE COWS AND A SPIKE CAME RUNNING OUT OF THE PINES A LITTLE AHEAD OF US INSTANTLY MISTER HAYNES'S GUN FLEW TO HIS SHOULDER AND A DEAFENING REPORT JARRED OUR EARS HE RAN FORWARD
7511-102420-0020 BUT I STOOD STILL FASCINATED BY WHAT I SAW OUR SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS BOUNDED BY A RIM OF ROCK OVER THE RIM WAS A SHEER WALL OF ROCK FOR TWO HUNDRED FEET TO WHERE THE GROS VENTRE WAS ANGRILY ROARING BELOW ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE STREAM
7511-102420-0021 ROSE THE RED CLIFFS WITH THEIR JAGGED CRAGS AT THE REPORT OF THE GUN TWO HUGE BLOCKS OF STONE ALMOST AS LARGE AS A HOUSE DETACHED THEMSELVES AND FELL AT THE SAME INSTANT ONE OF THE QUAKING ASP GROVES
7511-102420-0022 BEGAN TO MOVE SLOWLY I COULDN'T BELIEVE MY EYES I SHUT THEM A MOMENT BUT WHEN I LOOKED THE GROVE WAS MOVING FASTER IT SLID SWIFTLY AND I COULD PLAINLY HEAR THE RATTLE OF STONES FALLING AGAINST STONES UNTIL WITH A MUFFLED ROAR
7511-102420-0023 THE WHOLE HILLSIDE FELL INTO THE STREAM MISTER HAYNES CAME RUNNING BACK WHAT IS THE MATTER ARE YOU HURT WHY DIDN'T YOU SHOOT HE ASKED I WAVED MY HAND WEAKLY TOWARD WHERE THE GREAT MOUND OF TANGLED TREES AND EARTH BLOCKED THE WATER
7511-102420-0024 NOT AN EARTHQUAKE YOU ARE AS WHITE AS A GHOST COME ON UP HERE AND SEE MY FINE ELK I SAT ON A LOG WATCHING HIM DRESS HIS ELK WE HAVE FOUND IT BEST NOT TO REMOVE THE SKIN
7511-102420-0025 BUT THE ELK HAVE TO BE QUARTERED SO AS TO LOAD THEM ON TO A HORSE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY AND MISTER STRUBLE CAME OUT OF THE WOODS JUST THEN THEY HAD SEEN A BIG BUNCH OF ELK HEADED BY A SPLENDID BULL BUT GOT NO SHOT AND THE ELK WENT OUT OF THE PASS
7511-102420-0026 THEY HAD HEARD OUR SHOT AND CAME ACROSS TO SEE WHAT LUCK WHAT IVER IS THE MATTER WITH YE ASKED MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY MISTER HAYNES TOLD HER THEY HAD HEARD THE NOISE BUT HAD THOUGHT IT THUNDER MISTER HAYNES TOLD ME THAT IF I WOULD CHIRK UP
7511-102420-0027 HE WOULD GIVE ME HIS ELK TEETH THOUGH I DON'T ADMIRE THEM THEY ARE CONSIDERED VALUABLE HOWEVER HIS ELK WAS A COW AND THEY DON'T HAVE AS NICE TEETH AS DO BULLS WE HAD LUNCH AND THE MEN COVERED THE ELK WITH PINE BOUGHS
7511-102420-0028 TO KEEP THE CAMP ROBBERS FROM PECKING IT FULL OF HOLES NEXT DAY THE MEN WOULD COME WITH THE HORSES AND PACK IT IN TO CAMP WE ALL FELT REFRESHED SO WE STARTED ON THE TRAIL OF THOSE THAT GOT AWAY
7511-102420-0029 FOR A WHILE WALKING WAS EASY AND WE MADE PRETTY GOOD TIME THEN WE HAD A ROCKY HILL TO GET OVER WE HAD TO USE CARE WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TIMBER THERE WERE MARSHY PLACES WHICH TRIED US SORELY
7511-102420-0030 AND WINDFALL SO THICK THAT WE COULD HARDLY GET THROUGH WE WERE OBLIGED TO PICK OUR WAY CAREFULLY TO AVOID NOISE AND WE WERE ALL TOGETHER NOT HAVING COME TO A PLACE WHERE IT SEEMED BETTER TO SEPARATE
7511-102420-0031 WE HAD ABOUT RESOLVED TO GO TO OUR HORSES WHEN WE HEARD A VOLLEY OF SHOTS THAT IS SOMEBODY BUNCH SHOOTING SAID MISTER STRUBLE THEY ARE IN BREWSTER LAKE PARK BY THE SOUND THAT MEANS THAT THE ELK WILL PASS HERE IN A SHORT TIME AND WE MAY GET A SHOT
7511-102420-0032 THE ELK WILL BE HERE LONG BEFORE THE MEN SINCE THE MEN HAVE NO HORSES SO LET'S HURRY AND GET PLACED ALONG THE ONLY PLACE THEY CAN GET OUT WE'LL GET OUR LIMIT WE HASTILY SECRETED OURSELVES ALONG THE NARROW GORGE THROUGH WHICH THE ELK MUST PASS
7511-102420-0033 WE WERE ALL ON ONE SIDE AND MISTER HAYNES SAID TO ME REST YOUR GUN ON THAT ROCK AND AIM AT THE FIRST RIB BACK OF THE SHOULDER IF YOU SHOOT HAPHAZARD YOU MAY CRIPPLE AN ELK AND LET IT GET AWAY TO DIE IN MISERY SO MAKE SURE WHEN YOU FIRE
7511-102420-0034 IT DIDN'T SEEM A MINUTE BEFORE WE HEARD THE BEAT OF THEIR HOOFS AND A QUEER PANTING NOISE THAT I CAN'T DESCRIBE FIRST CAME A BEAUTIFUL THING WITH HIS HEAD HELD HIGH
7511-102420-0035 HIS EYES WERE STARTLED AND HIS SHINING BLACK MANE SEEMED TO BRISTLE I HEARD THE REPORT OF GUNS AND HE TUMBLED IN A CONFUSED HEAP HE TRIED TO RISE BUT OTHERS COMING LEAPED OVER HIM AND KNOCKED HIM DOWN SOME MORE SHOTS
7511-102420-0036 AND THOSE BEHIND TURNED AND WENT BACK THE WAY THEY HAD COME MISTER HAYNES SHOUTED TO ME SHOOT SHOOT WHY DON'T YOU SHOOT SO I FIRED MY KRAG BUT NEXT I FOUND MYSELF PICKING MYSELF UP
7511-102420-0037 AND WONDERING WHO HAD STRUCK ME AND FOR WHAT I WAS SO DIZZY I COULD SCARCELY MOVE BUT I GOT DOWN TO WHERE THE OTHERS WERE EXCITEDLY ADMIRING THE TWO DEAD ELK THAT THEY SAID WERE THE VICTIMS OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S GUN
7511-102420-0038 SHE WAS AS EXCITED AND DELIGHTED AS IF SHE HAD NEVER DECLARED SHE WOULD NOT KILL ANYTHING SURE IT'S MANY A MEAL THEY'LL MAKE FOR LITTLE HUNGRY MOUTHS SHE SAID SHE WAS RUBBING HER SHOULDER RUEFULLY
7511-102420-0039 I THOUGHT OLD GOLIAR HAD HIT ME A BIFF WITH A BLACKTHORN SHILALEY SHE REMARKED MISTER HAYNES TURNED TO ME AND SAID YOU ARE A DANDY HUNTER YOU DIDN'T SHOOT AT ALL UNTIL AFTER THE ELK WERE GONE
7511-102420-0040 AND THE WAY YOU HELD YOUR GUN IT IS A WONDER IT DIDN'T KNOCK YOUR HEAD OFF INSTEAD OF JUST SMASHING YOUR JAW THE MEN WORKED AS FAST AS THEY COULD AT THE ELK AND WE HELPED AS MUCH AS WE COULD BUT IT WAS DARK BEFORE WE REACHED CAMP
7511-102420-0041 SUPPER WAS READY BUT I WENT TO BED AT ONCE THEY ALL THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED BUT IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS SO STIFF AND SORE I COULD HARDLY MOVE AND SO TIRED I COULDN'T SLEEP NEXT MORNING MY JAW AND NECK WERE SO SWOLLEN
7511-102420-0042 THAT I HATED ANY ONE TO SEE ME AND MY HEAD ACHED FOR TWO DAYS IT HAS BEEN SNOWING FOR A LONG TIME BUT CLYDE SAYS HE WILL TAKE ME HUNTING WHEN IT STOPS
7511-102420-0043 AND GO BACK EMPTY HANDED AND PARTLY TO GET A REST FROM MISTER MURRY'S EVERLASTING ACCORDION MISTER MURRY IS AN OLD TIME ACQUAINTANCE OF MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY'S HE HAS A RANCH DOWN ON THE RIVER SOMEWHERE MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY HAS NOT SEEN HIM FOR YEARS
7511-102420-0044 DIDN'T KNOW HE LIVED UP HERE HE HAD SEEN THE GAME WARDEN FROM WHOM SHE HAD PROCURED HER LICENSE AND SO HUNTED UP OUR CAMP HE IS AN ODD LOOKING INDIVIDUAL WITH SAD EYES AND A DROOPING MOUTH WHICH GIVES HIS FACE A MOST HOPELESS REPROACHFUL EXPRESSION
7511-102420-0045 HIS NOSE HOWEVER SEEMS TO UPSET THE ORIGINAL PLAN FOR IT IS LONG AND THIN AND BENT SLIGHTLY TO ONE SIDE HIS NECK IS LONG AND HIS ADAM'S APPLE SEEMS UNCERTAIN AS TO WHERE IT BELONGS AT SUPPER JERRINE WATCHED IT
7511-102420-0046 AS IF FASCINATED UNTIL I SENT HER FROM THE TABLE AND WENT OUT TO SPEAK TO HER ABOUT GAZING WHY MAMMA SHE SAID I HAD TO LOOK HE HAS SWALLOWED SOMETHING THAT WON'T GO EITHER UP OR DOWN AND I'M FRAID HE'LL CHOKE
7511-102420-0047 ALTHOUGH I CAN'T BRAG ABOUT MISTER MURRY'S APPEARANCE I CAN ABOUT HIS TASTE FOR HE ADMIRES MISSUS O'SHAUGHNESSY IT SEEMS THAT IN YEARS GONE BY HE HAS MADE ATTEMPTS TO MARRY HER AS HE GOT UP FROM SUPPER THE FIRST NIGHT HE WAS WITH US HE SAID
7511-102420-0048 MARY ELLEN I HAVE A REAL TREAT AND SURPRISE FOR YOU JUST WAIT A FEW MINUTES AN I'LL BET YOU'LL BE HAPPY WE TOOK OUR ACCUSTOMED PLACES AROUND THE FIRE WHILE MISTER MURRY HOBBLED HIS CAYUSE AND TOOK AN ODD LOOKING BUNDLE FROM HIS SADDLE
7511-102420-0049 HE SEATED HIMSELF AND TOOK FROM THE BUNDLE AN ACCORDION HE SET IT UPON HIS KNEE AND BEGAN PULLING AND PUSHING ON IT HE DID WHAT MISTER STRUBLE SAID WAS DOLING A DOLEFUL TUNE EVERY ONE TOOK IT GOOD NATUREDLY
7511-102420-0050 BUT WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO RUN NIGGER RUN AND THE OLD GRAY HOSS COME A TEARIN OUT THE WILDERNESS I'LL SING THEM TO YOU WHEN I COME TO DENVER
7517-100429-0000 THE POND MY FRIEND ALDENHAM'S POND STANDS AT A CONVENIENT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE AND IS REACHED BY A WELL DRAINED GRAVEL PATH SO THAT IN ANY WEATHER ONE MAY WALK
7517-100429-0001 ALONE OR IN COMPANY DRY SHOD TO ITS BRINK AND ESTIMATE ROUGHLY HOW MANY INCHES OF RAIN HAVE FALLEN IN THE NIGHT THE RIBALD CALL IT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS POND TRACING
7517-100429-0002 A RESEMBLANCE BETWEEN IT AND THE BATH OF THE HIPPOPOTAMUS AT THE ZOO BENEATH THE WATERS OF WHICH IF YOU PARTICULARLY DESIRE TO POINT THE HIPPOPOTAMUS OUT TO SOMEBODY HE ALWAYS LIES HIDDEN TO THE REST OF US
7517-100429-0003 IT IS KNOWN SIMPLY AS THE POND A DESIGNATION WHICH IGNORES THE EXISTENCE OF SEVERAL NEIGHBOURING PONDS THE GIFTS OF NATURE AND GIVES THE WHOLE CREDIT TO THE HANDIWORK OF MAN
7517-100429-0004 FOR THE POND IS JUST A SMALL ARTIFICIAL AFFAIR OF CEMENT ENTIRELY UNPRETENTIOUS THERE ARE SEVEN STEPS TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POND AND EACH STEP
7517-100429-0005 THUS THE STEPS HELP TO MAKE THE POND A CONVENIENT RAIN GAUGE FOR OBVIOUSLY WHEN ONLY THREE STEPS ARE LEFT UNCOVERED AS WAS THE CASE LAST MONDAY
7517-100429-0006 WHEN THE POND BEGAN TO FILL TO STRANGERS THIS MAY SEEM SURPRISING AND IT IS ONLY FAIR TO TELL THEM THE GREAT SECRET WHICH IS THAT MUCH OF THE SURROUNDING LAND
7517-100429-0007 DRAINS SECRETLY INTO THE POND TOO THIS SEEMS TO ME TO GIVE A MUCH FAIRER INDICATION OF THE RAIN THAT HAS FALLEN THAN DO THE OFFICIAL FIGURES IN THE NEWSPAPERS
7517-100429-0008 FOR WHEN YOUR WHOLE DAY'S CRICKET HAS BEEN SPOILT IT IS PERFECTLY ABSURD
7517-100429-0009 HAS DONE THE DAMAGE THE SOUL YEARNS FOR SOMETHING MORE STARTLING THAN THAT THE RECORD OF THE POND
7517-100429-0010 SOOTHES US WHERE THE RECORD OF THE ORDINARY PEDANTIC RAIN GAUGE WOULD LEAVE US INFURIATED IT SPEAKS MUCH FOR MY FRIEND ALDENHAM'S BREADTH OF VIEW THAT HE UNDERSTOOD THIS
7517-100429-0011 AND PLANNED THE POND ACCORDINGLY A MOST NECESSARY THING IN A COUNTRY HOUSE IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A RECOGNIZED MEETING PLACE
7517-100429-0012 WHERE THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN WRITING A FEW LETTERS AFTER BREAKFAST MAY WHEN THEY HAVE FINISHED MEET THOSE WHO HAVE NO INTENTION OF WRITING ANY AND ARRANGE PLANS WITH THEM FOR THE MORNING
7517-100429-0013 I AM ONE OF THOSE WHO CANNOT WRITE LETTERS IN ANOTHER MAN'S HOUSE AND WHEN MY PIPE IS WELL ALIGHT I SAY TO MISS ROBINSON OR WHOEVER IT MAY BE LET'S GO AND LOOK AT THE POND
7517-100429-0014 RIGHT OH SHE SAYS WILLINGLY ENOUGH HAVING SPENT THE LAST QUARTER OF AN HOUR WITH THE TIMES FINANCIAL SUPPLEMENT ALL OF THE PAPER THAT IS LEFT TO THE WOMEN IN THE FIRST RUSH FOR THE CRICKET NEWS
7517-100429-0015 WE WANDER DOWN TO THE POND TOGETHER AND PERHAPS FIND BROWN AND MISS SMITH THERE A LOT OF RAIN IN THE NIGHT SAYS BROWN IT WAS ONLY JUST OVER THE THIRD STEP AFTER LUNCH YESTERDAY
7517-100429-0016 WE HAVE A LITTLE ARGUMENT ABOUT IT MISS ROBINSON BEING CONVINCED THAT SHE STOOD ON THE SECOND STEP AFTER BREAKFAST AND MISS SMITH REPEATING THAT IT LOOKS
7517-100429-0017 BY AND BY TWO OR THREE OTHERS STROLL UP AND WE ALL MAKE MEASUREMENTS TOGETHER THE GENERAL OPINION IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF RAIN IN THE NIGHT
7517-100429-0018 MUST BE A RECORD BUT ANYHOW IT IS FAIRLY FINE NOW AND WHAT ABOUT A LITTLE LAWN TENNIS OR GOLF OR CROQUET OR AND SO THE ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE MORNING ARE MADE
7517-100429-0019 AND THEY CAN BE MADE MORE READILY OUT OF DOORS FOR SUPPOSING IT IS FINE THE FRESH AIR CALLS YOU TO BE DOING SOMETHING AND THE SIGHT OF THE NEWLY MARKED TENNIS LAWN
7517-100429-0020 FILLS YOU WITH THOUGHTS OF REVENGE FOR YOUR ACCIDENTAL DEFEAT THE EVENING BEFORE BUT INDOORS IT IS SO EASY TO DROP INTO A SOFA AFTER BREAKFAST AND ONCE THERE WITH ALL THE PAPERS
7517-100429-0021 TO BE DISINCLINED TO LEAVE IT TILL LUNCH TIME A MAN OR WOMAN AS LAZY AS THIS MUST NOT BE RUSHED SAY TO SUCH A ONE COME AND PLAY AND THE INVITATION
7517-100429-0022 WILL BE DECLINED SAY COME AND LOOK AT THE POND AND THE WORST SLUGGARD WILL NOT REFUSE SUCH GENTLE EXERCISE AND ONCE HE IS OUT HE IS OUT
7517-100429-0023 ALL THIS FOR THOSE DELIGHTFUL SUMMER DAYS WHEN THERE ARE FINE INTERVALS BUT CONSIDER THE ADVANTAGES OF THE POND WHEN THE RAIN STREAMS DOWN IN TORRENTS
7517-100429-0024 FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT HOW TIRED WE GET OF BEING INDOORS ON THESE DAYS EVEN WITH THE BEST OF BOOKS THE PLEASANTEST OF COMPANIONS THE EASIEST OF BILLIARD TABLES
7517-100429-0025 YET IF OUR HOSTESS WERE TO SEE US MARCHING OUT WITH AN UMBRELLA HOW ODD SHE WOULD THINK US WHERE ARE YOU OFF TO SHE WOULD ASK AND WE COULD ONLY ANSWER LAMELY
7517-100429-0026 ER I WAS JUST GOING TO ER WALK ABOUT A BIT BUT NOW WE TELL HER BRIGHTLY I'M GOING TO SEE THE POND IT MUST BE NEARLY FULL WON'T YOU COME TOO AND WITH ANY LUCK SHE COMES
7517-100429-0027 TO THESE STREAMING DAYS TO REFLECT THAT IT ALL GOES TO FILL THE POND FOR THERE IS EVER BEFORE OUR MINDS THAT GREAT MOMENT IN THE FUTURE WHEN THE POND IS AT LAST FULL
7517-100429-0028 WHAT WILL HAPPEN THEN ALDENHAM MAY KNOW BUT WE HIS GUESTS DO NOT SOME THINK THERE WILL BE MERELY A FLOOD OVER THE SURROUNDING PATHS AND THE KITCHEN GARDEN BUT FOR MYSELF
7517-100429-0029 I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE PROMISED SOMETHING MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT A MAN WITH SUCH A BROAD AND FRIENDLY OUTLOOK TOWARDS RAIN GAUGES WILL BE SURE TO ARRANGE SOMETHING STRIKING WHEN THE GREAT MOMENT ARRIVES
7517-100429-0030 WILL HELP TO CELEBRATE IT I HAVE NO DOUBT WITH AN OPEN AIR PLAY TANK DRAMA OR WHAT NOT AT ANY RATE WE HAVE EVERY HOPE THAT HE WILL EMPTY THE POND AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE
7517-100429-0031 SO THAT WE MAY WATCH IT FILL AGAIN I MUST SAY THAT HE HAS BEEN A LITTLE LUCKY IN HIS CHOICE OF A YEAR FOR INAUGURATING THE POND BUT ALL THE SAME
7517-100429-0032 HAVE FALLEN IN THE LAST THREE WEEKS
7517-100437-0000 A HOUSEHOLD BOOK ONCE ON A TIME I DISCOVERED SAMUEL BUTLER NOT THE OTHER TWO BUT THE ONE WHO WROTE THE WAY OF ALL FLESH THE SECOND BEST NOVEL IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE
7517-100437-0001 I SAY THE SECOND BEST SO THAT IF YOU REMIND ME OF TOM JONES OR THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE OR ANY OTHER THAT YOU FANCY I CAN SAY THAT OF COURSE THAT ONE IS THE BEST
7517-100437-0002 WELL I DISCOVERED HIM JUST AS VOLTAIRE DISCOVERED HABAKKUK OR YOUR LITTLE BOY DISCOVERED SHAKESPEARE THE OTHER DAY AND I COMMITTED MY DISCOVERY TO THE WORLD
7517-100437-0003 IN TWO GLOWING ARTICLES NOT UNNATURALLY THE WORLD REMAINED UNMOVED IT KNEW ALL ABOUT SAMUEL BUTLER LAST WEEK I DISCOVERED A FRENCHMAN
7517-100437-0004 WHO WROTE IN THE EARLY PART OF LAST CENTURY A BOOK CALLED
7517-100437-0005 MY UNCLE BENJAMIN I READ IT IN THE TRANSLATION EAGER AS I AM TO BE LYRICAL ABOUT IT I SHALL REFRAIN I THINK THAT I AM PROBABLY SAFER WITH TILLIER THAN WITH BUTLER
7517-100437-0006 BUT I DARE NOT RISK IT THE THOUGHT OF YOUR SCORN AT MY PREVIOUS IGNORANCE OF THE WORLD FAMOUS TILLIER YOUR AMUSED CONTEMPT BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY JUST SUCCEEDED
7517-100437-0007 IN BORROWING THE CLASSIC UPON WHICH YOU WERE BROUGHT UP THIS IS TOO MUCH FOR ME LET US SAY NO MORE ABOUT IT
7517-100437-0008 WHO HAS NOT HEARD OF CLAUDE TILLIER
7517-100437-0009 WHO HAS NOT READ IT IN FRENCH OR AS I DID IN AMERICAN LET US PASS ON TO ANOTHER BOOK FOR I AM GOING TO SPEAK OF ANOTHER DISCOVERY
7517-100437-0010 OF A BOOK WHICH SHOULD BE A CLASSIC BUT IS NOT OF A BOOK OF WHICH NOBODY HAS HEARD UNLESS THROUGH ME IT WAS PUBLISHED SOME TWELVE YEARS AGO THE LAST PUBLISHED BOOK
7517-100437-0011 OF A WELL KNOWN WRITER WHEN I TELL YOU HIS NAME YOU WILL SAY OH YES I LOVE HIS BOOKS AND YOU WILL MENTION SO AND SO AND ITS EQUALLY FAMOUS SEQUEL SUCH AND SUCH
7517-100437-0012 BUT WHEN I ASK YOU IF YOU HAVE READ MY BOOK YOU WILL PROFESS SURPRISE AND SAY THAT YOU HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT IS IT AS GOOD AS SO AND SO AND SUCH AND SUCH YOU WILL ASK
7517-100437-0013 HARDLY BELIEVING THAT THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE MUCH BETTER I SHALL REPLY AND THERE IF THESE THINGS WERE ARRANGED PROPERLY WOULD BE ANOTHER TEN PER CENT IN MY POCKET BUT BELIEVE ME
7517-100437-0014 I SHALL BE QUITE CONTENT WITH YOUR GRATITUDE WELL THE WRITER OF MY BOOK IS KENNETH GRAHAME YOU HAVE HEARD OF HIM GOOD I THOUGHT SO THE BOOKS YOU HAVE READ
7517-100437-0015 ARE THE GOLDEN AGE AND DREAM DAYS AM I NOT RIGHT THANK YOU BUT THE BOOK YOU HAVE NOT READ MY BOOK
7517-100437-0016 THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS AM I NOT RIGHT AGAIN AH I WAS AFRAID SO THE REASON WHY I KNEW YOU HAD NOT READ IT IS THE REASON WHY I CALL IT MY BOOK
7517-100437-0017 FOR THE LAST TEN OR TWELVE YEARS I HAVE BEEN RECOMMENDING IT USUALLY I SPEAK ABOUT IT AT MY FIRST MEETING WITH A STRANGER IT IS MY OPENING REMARK JUST AS YOURS IS SOMETHING FUTILE ABOUT THE WEATHER
7517-100437-0018 IF I DON'T GET IT IN AT THE BEGINNING I SQUEEZE IT IN AT THE END THE STRANGER HAS GOT TO HAVE IT SOME TIME SHOULD I EVER FIND MYSELF IN THE DOCK AND ONE NEVER KNOWS
7517-100437-0019 MY ANSWER TO THE QUESTION WHETHER I HAD ANYTHING TO SAY WOULD BE WELL MY LORD IF I MIGHT JUST RECOMMEND A BOOK TO THE JURY BEFORE LEAVING MISTER JUSTICE DARLING
7517-100437-0020 WOULD PROBABLY PRETEND THAT HE HAD READ IT BUT HE WOULDN'T DECEIVE ME FOR ONE CANNOT RECOMMEND A BOOK TO ALL THE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE WHOM ONE HAS MET IN TEN YEARS WITHOUT DISCOVERING
7517-100437-0021 WHETHER IT IS WELL KNOWN OR NOT IT IS THE AMAZING TRUTH THAT NONE OF THOSE HUNDREDS HAD HEARD OF THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS UNTIL I TOLD THEM ABOUT IT
7517-100437-0022 SOME OF THEM HAD NEVER HEARD OF KENNETH GRAHAME WELL ONE DID NOT HAVE TO MEET THEM AGAIN AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS TO MAKE A WORLD BUT MOST OF THEM WERE IN YOUR POSITION
7517-100437-0023 GREAT ADMIRERS OF THE AUTHOR AND HIS TWO EARLIER FAMOUS BOOKS BUT IGNORANT THEREAFTER I HAD THEIR PROMISE BEFORE THEY LEFT ME AND WAITED CONFIDENTLY
7517-100437-0024 FOR THEIR GRATITUDE NO DOUBT THEY ALSO SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS IN THEIR TURN AND IT IS JUST POSSIBLE THAT IT REACHED YOU IN THIS WAY BUT IT WAS TO ME
7517-100437-0025 NONE THE LESS THAT YOUR THANKS WERE DUE FOR INSTANCE YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED A COUPLE OF CASUAL REFERENCES TO IT AS IF IT WERE A CLASSIC KNOWN TO ALL IN A FAMOUS NOVEL
7517-100437-0026 PUBLISHED LAST YEAR IT WAS I WHO INTRODUCED THAT NOVELIST TO IT SIX MONTHS BEFORE INDEED I FEEL SOMETIMES THAT IT WAS I WHO WROTE THE WIND IN THE WILLOWS
7517-100437-0027 AND RECOMMENDED IT TO KENNETH GRAHAME BUT PERHAPS I AM WRONG HERE FOR I HAVE NOT THE PLEASURE OF HIS ACQUAINTANCE NOR AS I HAVE ALREADY LAMENTED AM I FINANCIALLY INTERESTED IN ITS SALE
7517-100437-0028 AN EXPLANATION WHICH SUSPICIOUS STRANGERS REQUIRE FROM ME SOMETIMES I SHALL NOT DESCRIBE THE BOOK FOR NO DESCRIPTION WOULD HELP IT BUT I SHALL JUST SAY THIS
7517-100437-0029 THAT IT IS WHAT I CALL A HOUSEHOLD BOOK BY A HOUSEHOLD BOOK I MEAN A BOOK WHICH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSEHOLD LOVES AND QUOTES CONTINUALLY EVER AFTERWARDS A BOOK WHICH IS READ ALOUD
7517-100437-0030 TO EVERY NEW GUEST AND IS REGARDED AS THE TOUCHSTONE OF HIS WORTH BUT IT IS A BOOK WHICH MAKES YOU FEEL THAT THOUGH EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE LOVES IT IT IS ONLY YOU
7517-100437-0031 WHO REALLY APPRECIATE IT AT ITS TRUE VALUE AND THAT THE OTHERS ARE SCARCELY WORTHY OF IT IT IS OBVIOUS YOU PERSUADE YOURSELF THAT THE AUTHOR WAS THINKING OF YOU
7517-100437-0032 WHEN HE WROTE IT I HOPE THIS WILL PLEASE JONES WERE HIS FINAL WORDS AS HE LAID DOWN HIS PEN WELL OF COURSE YOU WILL ORDER THE BOOK AT ONCE
7517-100437-0033 BUT I MUST GIVE YOU ONE WORD OF WARNING WHEN YOU SIT DOWN TO IT DON'T BE SO RIDICULOUS AS TO SUPPOSE THAT YOU ARE SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON MY TASTE
7517-100437-0034 STILL LESS ON THE GENIUS OF KENNETH GRAHAME YOU ARE MERELY SITTING IN JUDGMENT ON YOURSELF YOU MAY BE WORTHY I DO NOT KNOW
7517-100442-0000 AT THE BOOKSTALL I HAVE OFTEN LONGED TO BE A GROCER TO BE SURROUNDED BY SO MANY INTERESTING THINGS SARDINES BOTTLED RASPBERRIES
7517-100442-0001 BISCUITS WITH SUGAR ON THE TOP PRESERVED GINGER HAMS BRAWN UNDER GLASS EVERYTHING IN FACT THAT MAKES LIFE WORTH LIVING
7517-100442-0002 AT ONE MOMENT TO WALK UP A LADDER IN SEARCH OF NUTMEG AT THE NEXT TO DIVE UNDER A COUNTER IN PURSUIT OF CINNAMON TO SERVE LITTLE GIRLS
7517-100442-0003 AND LORDLY PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND ME WITH A PINT OF CHERRY GIN IS NOT THIS TO FOLLOW THE KING OF TRADES SOME DAY I SHALL OPEN A GROCER'S SHOP AND YOU WILL FIND ME IN MY SPARE EVENINGS
7517-100442-0004 APRONED BEHIND THE COUNTER LOOK OUT FOR THE CURRANTS IN THE WINDOW AS YOU COME IN I HAVE AN IDEA FOR SOMETHING ARTISTIC IN THE WAY OF PATTERNS THERE BUT AS YOU LOVE ME DO NOT OFFER TO BUY ANY
7517-100442-0005 WE GROCERS ONLY PUT THE CURRANTS OUT FOR SHOW AND SO THAT WE MAY RUN OUR FINGERS THROUGH THEM LUXURIOUSLY WHEN BUSINESS IS SLACK I HAVE A GOOD LINE IN SHORTBREADS MADAM IF I CAN FIND THE BOX
7517-100442-0006 BUT NO CURRANTS THIS EVENING I BEG YOU YES TO BE A GROCER IS TO LIVE WELL BUT AFTER ALL IT IS NOT TO SEE LIFE A GROCER
7517-100442-0007 IN AS FAR AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO A MAN WHO SELLS BOTH SCENTED SOAP AND PILCHARDS WOULD BECOME NARROW WE DO NOT COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLD MUCH SAVE THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF POTTED LOBSTER
7517-100442-0008 AND TO SELL A MAN POTTED LOBSTER IS NOT TO HAVE OUR FINGERS ON HIS PULSE POTTED LOBSTER DOES NOT DEFINE A MAN ALL CUSTOMERS ARE ALIKE TO THE GROCER PROVIDED THEIR MONEY IS GOOD
7517-100442-0009 I PERCEIVE NOW THAT I WAS OVER HASTY IN DECIDING TO BECOME A GROCER THAT IS RATHER FOR ONE'S OLD AGE WHILE ONE IS YOUNG AND INTERESTED IN PERSONS RATHER THAN IN THINGS
7517-100442-0010 THERE IS ONLY ONE PROFESSION TO FOLLOW THE PROFESSION OF BOOKSTALL CLERK TO BE BEHIND A BOOKSTALL IS INDEED TO SEE LIFE THE FASCINATION OF IT STRUCK ME SUDDENLY
7517-100442-0011 LAST MONDAY AND WONDERED WHO BOUGHT THE TIE CLIPS THE ANSWER CAME TO ME JUST AS I GOT INTO MY TRAIN ASK THE MAN BEHIND THE BOOKSTALL HE WOULD KNOW
7517-100442-0012 YES AND HE WOULD KNOW WHO BOUGHT ALL HIS PAPERS AND BOOKS AND PAMPHLETS AND TO KNOW THIS IS TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE IN THE WORLD
7517-100442-0013 YOU CANNOT TELL A MAN BY THE LOBSTER HE EATS BUT YOU CAN TELL SOMETHING ABOUT HIM BY THE LITERATURE HE READS FOR INSTANCE I ONCE OCCUPIED A CARRIAGE ON AN EASTERN LINE
7517-100442-0014 WITH AMONG OTHERS A MIDDLE AGED WOMAN AS SOON AS WE LEFT LIVERPOOL STREET SHE PRODUCED A BAG OF SHRIMPS GRASPED EACH INDIVIDUAL IN TURN FIRMLY BY THE HEAD AND TAIL
7517-100442-0015 AND ATE HIM WHEN SHE HAD FINISHED SHE EMPTIED THE ENDS OUT OF THE WINDOW WIPED HER HANDS AND SETTLED DOWN COMFORTABLY TO HER PAPER WHAT PAPER YOU'LL NEVER GUESS
7517-100442-0016 I SHALL HAVE TO TELL YOU THE MORNING POST NOW DOESN'T THAT GIVE YOU THE WOMAN THE SHRIMPS ALONE NO THE PAPER ALONE NO BUT THE TWO TO GETHER
7517-100442-0017 CONCEIVE THE HOLY JOY OF THE BOOKSTALL CLERK AS SHE AND HER BAG OF SHRIMPS YES HE COULD HAVE TOLD AT ONCE THEY WERE SHRIMPS APPROACHED AND ASKED FOR THE MORNING POST
7517-100442-0018 THE DAY CAN NEVER BE DULL TO THE BOOKSTALL CLERK I IMAGINE HIM ASSIGNING IN HIS MIND THE RIGHT PAPER TO EACH CUSTOMER THIS MAN WILL ASK FOR GOLFING WRONG
7517-100442-0019 HE WANTS CAGE BIRDS THAT ONE OVER THERE WANTS THE MOTOR AH WELL THE AUTO CAR THAT'S NEAR ENOUGH SOON HE WOULD BEGIN TO KNOW THE DIFFERENT TYPES HE WOULD LEARN TO DISTINGUISH
7517-100442-0020 BETWEEN THE PATRONS OF THE DANCING TIMES AND OF THE VOTE THE ERA AND THE ATHENAEUM DELIGHTFUL SURPRISES WOULD OVERWHELM HIM AT INTERVALS AS WHEN
7517-100442-0021 A RED LETTER DAY IN ALL THE GREAT STATIONS A GENTLEMAN IN A CHECK WAISTCOAT MAKES THE DOUBLE PURCHASE OF HOMER'S PENNY STORIES AND THE SPECTATOR ON THOSE OCCASIONS
7517-100442-0022 AND THEY WOULD BE VERY RARE HIS FAITH IN HUMAN NATURE WOULD BEGIN TO OOZE AWAY UNTIL ALL AT ONCE HE WOULD TELL HIMSELF EXCITEDLY THAT THE MAN WAS OBVIOUSLY AN ESCAPED CRIMINAL IN DISGUISE
7517-100442-0023 RATHER OVERDOING THE PART AFTER WHICH HE WOULD HAND OVER THE WINNING POST AND THE ANIMALS FRIEND TO THE PURSUING DETECTIVE IN A SORT OF HOLY AWE WHAT A LIFE
7517-100442-0024 BUT HE HAS OTHER THINGS THAN PAPERS TO SELL HE KNOWS WHO BUYS THOSE LITTLE SIXPENNY BOOKS OF FUNNY STORIES A PROBLEM WHICH HAS OFTEN PUZZLED US OTHERS
7517-100442-0025 HE UNDERSTANDS BY NOW THE TYPE OF MAN WHO WANTS TO READ UP A FEW GOOD JOKES TO TELL THEM DOWN AT OLD ROBINSON'S WHERE HE IS GOING FOR THE WEEK END OUR BOOKSTALL CLERK DOESN'T WAIT TO BE ASKED
7517-100442-0026 AS SOON AS THIS GENTLEMAN APPROACHES HE WHIPS OUT THE BOOK DUSTS IT AND PLACES IT BEFORE THE RACONTEUR HE RECOGNIZES ALSO AT A GLANCE THE SORT OF SILLY ASS
7517-100442-0027 WHO IS ALWAYS LOSING HIS INDIARUBBER UMBRELLA RING HALF WAY ACROSS THE STATION HE CAN SEE HIM AND HE HASTENS TO GET A NEW CARD OUT IN READINESS OR WE WOULD LET YOU HAVE SEVEN FOR SIXPENCE SIR
7517-100442-0028 AND EVEN WHEN ONE OF THOSE SUBTLER CHARACTERS DRAWS NEAR ABOUT WHOM IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY IMMEDIATELY WHETHER THEY REQUIRE A FOUNTAIN PEN WITH CASE OR THE LIFE AND LETTERS
7517-100442-0029 OF MAJOR GENERAL CLEMENT BULGER C B EVEN THEN THE MAN BEHIND THE BOOKSTALL IS NOT FOUND WANTING IF HE IS WRONG THE FIRST TIME HE NEVER FAILS TO RECOVER WITH HIS SECOND BULGER SIR
7517-100442-0030 ONE OF OUR GREATEST SOLDIERS I THOUGHT OF THESE THINGS LAST MONDAY AND DEFINITELY RENOUNCED THE IDEA OF BECOMING A GROCER AND AS I WANDERED ROUND THE BOOKSTALL THINKING
7517-100442-0031 I CAME ACROSS A LITTLE BOOK SIXPENCE IN CLOTH A SHILLING IN LEATHER CALLED PROVERBS AND MAXIMS IT CONTAINED SOME THOUSANDS OF THE BEST THOUGHTS IN ALL LANGUAGES
7517-100442-0032 SUCH AS HAVE GUIDED MEN ALONG THE PATH OF TRUTH SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE WORLD FROM WHAT HO SHE BUMPS TO ICH DIEN AND MORE THE THOUGHT OCCURRED TO ME
7517-100442-0033 THAT AN INTERESTING ARTICLE MIGHT BE EXTRACTED FROM IT SO I BOUGHT THE BOOK UNFORTUNATELY ENOUGH I LEFT IT IN THE TRAIN BEFORE I HAD TIME TO MASTER IT I SHALL BE AT THE BOOKSTALL NEXT MONDAY
7517-100442-0034 AND I SHALL HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER COPY THAT WILL BE ALL RIGHT YOU SHAN'T MISS IT BUT I AM WONDERING NOW WHAT THE BOOKSTALL CLERK WILL MAKE OF ME A MAN WHO KEEPS ON BUYING PROVERBS AND MAXIMS
7635-105409-0000 MARGUERITE'S ACHING HEART STOOD STILL SHE FELT MORE THAN SHE HEARD THE MEN ON THE WATCH PREPARING FOR THE FIGHT HER SENSES TOLD HER THAT EACH WITH SWORD IN HAND WAS CROUCHING READY FOR THE SPRING
7635-105409-0001 THE VOICE CAME NEARER AND NEARER IN THE VAST IMMENSITY OF THESE LONELY CLIFFS WITH THE LOUD MURMUR OF THE SEA BELOW IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY HOW NEAR OR HOW FAR NOR YET FROM WHICH DIRECTION CAME THAT CHEERFUL SINGER WHO SANG TO GOD TO SAVE HIS KING WHILST HE HIMSELF WAS IN SUCH DEADLY DANGER
7635-105409-0002 FELT THAT HER VERY LIFE WAS SLIPPING AWAY AS IF WHEN THAT VOICE DREW NEARER WHEN THAT SINGER BECAME ENTRAPPED SHE DISTINCTLY HEARD THE CLICK OF DESGAS GUN CLOSE TO HER NO NO NO NO OH GOD IN HEAVEN THIS CANNOT BE
7635-105409-0003 LET ARMAND'S BLOOD THEN BE ON HER OWN HEAD LET HER BE BRANDED AS HIS MURDERER LET EVEN HE WHOM SHE LOVED DESPISE AND LOATHE HER FOR THIS BUT GOD OH GOD SAVE HIM AT ANY COST WITH A WILD SHRIEK SHE SPRANG TO HER FEET AND DARTED ROUND THE ROCK
7635-105409-0004 ARMAND ARMAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FIRE YOUR LEADER IS NEAR HE IS COMING HE IS BETRAYED ARMAND ARMAND FIRE IN HEAVEN'S NAME SHE WAS SEIZED AND THROWN TO THE GROUND SHE LAY THERE MOANING BRUISED NOT CARING BUT STILL HALF SOBBING HALF SHRIEKING
7635-105409-0005 PERCY MY HUSBAND FOR GOD'S SAKE FLY ARMAND ARMAND WHY DON'T YOU FIRE
7635-105409-0006 SOMETHING WAS THROWN OVER HER FACE SHE COULD NOT BREATHE AND PERFORCE SHE WAS SILENT THE BOLD SINGER TOO HAD BECOME SILENT WARNED NO DOUBT OF HIS IMPENDING DANGER BY MARGUERITE'S FRANTIC SHRIEKS THE MEN HAD SPRUNG TO THEIR FEET THERE WAS NO NEED FOR FURTHER SILENCE ON THEIR PART
7635-105409-0007 THE VERY CLIFFS ECHOED THE POOR HEART BROKEN WOMAN'S SCREAMS CHAUVELIN WITH A MUTTERED OATH WHICH BODED NO GOOD TO HER WHO HAD DARED TO UPSET HIS MOST CHERISHED PLANS HAD HASTILY SHOUTED THE WORD OF COMMAND INTO IT MY MEN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE FROM THAT HUT ALIVE
7635-105409-0008 THE MOON HAD ONCE MORE EMERGED FROM BETWEEN THE CLOUDS THE DARKNESS ON THE CLIFFS HAD GONE GIVING PLACE ONCE MORE TO BRILLIANT SILVERY LIGHT SOME OF THE SOLDIERS HAD RUSHED TO THE ROUGH WOODEN DOOR OF THE HUT WHILST ONE OF THEM KEPT GUARD OVER MARGUERITE
7635-105409-0009 THE DOOR WAS PARTIALLY OPEN ONE OF THE SOLDIERS PUSHED IT FURTHER BUT WITHIN ALL WAS DARKNESS THE CHARCOAL FIRE ONLY LIGHTING WITH A DIM RED LIGHT THE FURTHEST CORNER OF THE HUT THE SOLDIERS PAUSED AUTOMATICALLY AT THE DOOR LIKE MACHINES WAITING FOR FURTHER ORDERS
7635-105409-0010 WAS FOR THE MOMENT PARALYZED WITH ASTONISHMENT WHEN HE SAW THE SOLDIERS STANDING THERE AT ATTENTION LIKE SENTRIES ON GUARD WHILST NOT A SOUND PROCEEDED FROM THE HUT FILLED WITH STRANGE ANXIOUS FOREBODING HE TOO WENT TO THE DOOR OF THE HUT AND PEERING INTO THE GLOOM HE ASKED QUICKLY
7635-105409-0011 WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS I THINK CITOYEN THAT THERE IS NO ONE THERE NOW REPLIED ONE OF THE SOLDIERS IMPERTURBABLY YOU HAVE NOT LET THOSE FOUR MEN GO THUNDERED CHAUVELIN MENACINGLY I ORDERED YOU TO LET NO MAN ESCAPE ALIVE QUICK AFTER THEM ALL OF YOU QUICK IN EVERY DIRECTION
7635-105409-0012 THE MEN OBEDIENT AS MACHINES RUSHED DOWN THE ROCKY INCLINE TOWARDS THE BEACH SOME GOING OFF TO RIGHT AND LEFT AS FAST AS THEIR FEET COULD CARRY THEM YOU AND YOUR MEN WILL PAY WITH YOUR LIVES FOR THIS BLUNDER CITOYEN SERGEANT SAID CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY TO THE SERGEANT WHO HAD BEEN IN CHARGE OF THE MEN
7635-105409-0013 AND YOU TOO CITOYEN HE ADDED TURNING WITH A SNARL TO DESGAS FOR DISOBEYING MY ORDERS YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN UNTIL THE TALL ENGLISHMAN ARRIVED AND JOINED THE FOUR MEN IN THE HUT NO ONE CAME SAID THE SERGEANT SULLENLY
7635-105409-0014 BUT I ORDERED YOU JUST NOW WHEN THE WOMAN SCREAMED TO RUSH IN AND LET NO ONE ESCAPE BUT CITOYEN THE FOUR MEN WHO WERE THERE BEFORE HAD BEEN GONE SOME TIME I THINK YOU THINK YOU SAID CHAUVELIN ALMOST CHOKING WITH FURY AND YOU LET THEM GO
7635-105409-0015 YOU ORDERED US TO WAIT CITOYEN PROTESTED THE SERGEANT AND TO IMPLICITLY OBEY YOUR COMMANDS ON PAIN OF DEATH WE WAITED
7635-105409-0016 WHICH WAY DID THEY GO ASKED CHAUVELIN I COULD NOT TELL CITOYEN SAID THE SERGEANT THEY WENT STRAIGHT DOWN THE CLIFF FIRST THEN DISAPPEARED BEHIND SOME BOULDERS HUSH WHAT WAS THAT ALL THREE MEN LISTENED ATTENTIVELY
7635-105409-0017 IN THE FAR VERY FAR DISTANCE COULD BE HEARD FAINTLY ECHOING AND ALREADY DYING AWAY THE QUICK SHARP SPLASH OF HALF A DOZEN OARS CHAUVELIN TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF AND WIPED THE PERSPIRATION FROM HIS FOREHEAD THE SCHOONER'S BOAT WAS ALL HE GASPED
7635-105409-0018 EVIDENTLY ARMAND SAINT JUST AND HIS THREE COMPANIONS HAD MANAGED TO CREEP ALONG THE SIDE OF THE CLIFFS WHILST THE MEN LIKE TRUE SOLDIERS OF THE WELL DRILLED REPUBLICAN ARMY HAD WITH BLIND OBEDIENCE AND IN FEAR OF THEIR OWN LIVES IMPLICITLY OBEYED CHAUVELIN'S ORDERS
7635-105409-0019 TO WAIT FOR THE TALL ENGLISHMAN WHO WAS THE IMPORTANT CAPTURE THEY HAD NO DOUBT REACHED ONE OF THE CREEKS WHICH JUT FAR OUT TO SEA ON THIS COAST AT INTERVALS BEHIND THIS THE BOAT OF THE DAY DREAM MUST HAVE BEEN ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THEM
7635-105409-0020 IT NEEDED ALL CHAUVELIN'S NERVE AND PRESENCE OF MIND NOT TO GIVE WAY TO A USELESS AND UNDIGNIFIED ACCESS OF RAGE
7635-105409-0021 HOW HE HAD CONTRIVED TO REACH THE HUT WITHOUT BEING SEEN BY ONE OF THE THIRTY SOLDIERS WHO GUARDED THE SPOT WAS MORE THAN CHAUVELIN COULD CONCEIVE THAT HE HAD DONE SO BEFORE THE THIRTY MEN HAD ARRIVED ON THE CLIFF WAS OF COURSE FAIRLY CLEAR
7635-105409-0022 THERE WERE NO FAIRIES AND HOBGOBLINS ABOUT
7635-105409-0023 BY THAT TIME THE FOUR FUGITIVES MUST HAVE REACHED THE CREEK AND GOT INTO THE BOAT AND THE NEAREST CREEK WAS MORE THAN A MILE FROM THE HUT WHERE HAD THAT DARING SINGER GOT TO UNLESS SATAN HIMSELF HAD LENT HIM WINGS HE COULD NOT HAVE COVERED THAT MILE ON A ROCKY CLIFF IN THE SPACE OF TWO MINUTES
7635-105409-0024 ONE OR TWO OF THE MEN WHO HAD RUN AFTER THE FUGITIVES WERE NOW SLOWLY WORKING THEIR WAY UP THE CLIFF ONE OF THEM REACHED CHAUVELIN'S SIDE AT THE VERY MOMENT THAT THIS HOPE AROSE IN THE ASTUTE DIPLOMATIST'S HEART
7635-105409-0025 WE WERE TOO LATE CITOYEN THE SOLDIER SAID WE REACHED THE BEACH JUST BEFORE THE MOON WAS HIDDEN BY THAT BANK OF CLOUDS THE BOAT HAD UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN ON THE LOOK OUT BEHIND THAT FIRST CREEK A MILE OFF BUT SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO WHEN WE GOT TO THE BEACH AND WAS ALREADY SOME WAY OUT TO SEA
7635-105409-0026 YES SAID CHAUVELIN WITH EAGER IMPATIENCE SHE HAD SHOVED OFF SOME TIME AGO YOU SAID AND THE NEAREST CREEK IS A MILE FURTHER ON YES CITOYEN I RAN ALL THE WAY STRAIGHT TO THE BEACH THOUGH I GUESSED THE BOAT WOULD HAVE WAITED SOMEWHERE NEAR THE CREEK AS THE TIDE WOULD REACH THERE EARLIEST
7635-105409-0027 WITH A RAPID GLANCE CHAUVELIN NOTED ITS CONTENTS THE CAULDRON PLACED CLOSE UNDER AN APERTURE IN THE WALL AND CONTAINING THE LAST FEW DYING EMBERS OF BURNED CHARCOAL A COUPLE OF STOOLS OVERTURNED AS IF IN THE HASTE OF SUDDEN DEPARTURE
7635-105409-0028 THEN THE FISHERMAN'S TOOLS AND HIS NETS LYING IN ONE CORNER AND BESIDE THEM SOMETHING SMALL AND WHITE PICK THAT UP SAID CHAUVELIN TO THE SERGEANT POINTING TO THIS WHITE SCRAP AND BRING IT TO ME
7635-105409-0029 IT WAS A CRUMPLED PIECE OF PAPER EVIDENTLY FORGOTTEN THERE BY THE FUGITIVES IN THEIR HURRY TO GET AWAY THE SERGEANT MUCH AWED BY THE CITOYEN'S OBVIOUS RAGE AND IMPATIENCE PICKED THE PAPER UP AND HANDED IT RESPECTFULLY TO CHAUVELIN READ IT SERGEANT SAID THE LATTER CURTLY
7635-105409-0030 IT IS ALMOST ILLEGIBLE CITOYEN A FEARFUL SCRAWL I ORDERED YOU TO READ IT REPEATED CHAUVELIN VICIOUSLY THE SERGEANT BY THE LIGHT OF HIS LANTERN BEGAN DECIPHERING THE FEW HASTILY SCRAWLED WORDS
7635-105409-0031 I CANNOT QUITE REACH YOU WITHOUT RISKING YOUR LIVES AND ENDANGERING THE SUCCESS OF YOUR RESCUE WHEN YOU RECEIVE THIS WAIT TWO MINUTES THEN CREEP OUT OF THE HUT ONE BY ONE TURN TO YOUR LEFT SHARPLY AND CREEP CAUTIOUSLY DOWN THE CLIFF
7635-105409-0032 I SHALL BE THERE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE THEY MUST WAIT FOR ME AT A SAFE DISTANCE OUT AT SEA TILL THEY HEAR THE USUAL SIGNAL DO NOT DELAY AND OBEY THESE INSTRUCTIONS IMPLICITLY THEN THERE IS THE SIGNATURE CITOYEN ADDED THE SERGEANT AS HE HANDED THE PAPER BACK TO CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0033 BUT THE LATTER HAD NOT WAITED AN INSTANT ONE PHRASE OF THE MOMENTOUS SCRAWL HAD CAUGHT HIS EAR
7635-105409-0034 THAT PHRASE MIGHT YET MEAN VICTORY FOR HIM WHICH OF YOU KNOWS THIS COAST WELL HE SHOUTED TO HIS MEN WHO NOW ONE BY ONE ALL RETURNED FROM THEIR FRUITLESS RUN AND WERE ALL ASSEMBLED ONCE MORE ROUND THE HUT
7635-105409-0035 THERE IS CITOYEN I KNOW IT WELL THE ENGLISHMAN IS HOPING TO REACH THAT CREEK
7635-105409-0036 AT ANY RATE THERE IS A CHANCE TO GET HIM YET A THOUSAND FRANCS TO EACH MAN WHO GETS TO THAT CREEK BEFORE THAT LONG LEGGED ENGLISHMAN I KNOW OF A SHORT CUT ACROSS THE CLIFFS SAID THE SOLDIER AND WITH AN ENTHUSIASTIC SHOUT HE RUSHED FORWARD FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY HIS COMRADES
7635-105409-0037 WITHIN A FEW MINUTES THEIR RUNNING FOOTSTEPS HAD DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE
7635-105409-0038 HIS WELL LAID PLAN HAD FAILED ITS SEQUEL WAS PROBLEMATICAL THERE WAS STILL A GREAT CHANCE NOW THAT THE SCARLET PIMPERNEL MIGHT YET ESCAPE AND CHAUVELIN WITH THAT UNREASONING FURY WHICH SOMETIMES ASSAILS A STRONG NATURE WAS LONGING TO VENT HIS RAGE ON SOMEBODY
7635-105409-0039 THE SOLDIERS WERE HOLDING MARGUERITE PINIONED TO THE GROUND THOUGH SHE POOR SOUL WAS NOT MAKING THE FAINTEST STRUGGLE
7635-105409-0040 HER EYES CIRCLED BY DEEP PURPLE LINES THAT TOLD OF LONG SLEEPLESS NIGHTS HER HAIR MATTED AND DAMP ROUND HER FOREHEAD HER LIPS PARTED IN A SHARP CURVE THAT SPOKE OF PHYSICAL PAIN
7635-105409-0041 BUT THE HARD VENGEFUL HEART OF HER BAFFLED ENEMY
7635-105409-0042 OBEDIENTLY THE SOLDIERS ROSE TO THEIR FEET YOU'D BETTER TRY AND FIND THAT FOOTPATH AGAIN FOR ME AND THAT BROKEN DOWN CART WE LEFT ON THE ROAD THEN SUDDENLY A BRIGHT IDEA SEEMED TO STRIKE HIM AH BY THE BYE WHERE IS THE JEW
7635-105409-0043 I GAGGED HIM AND TIED HIS LEGS TOGETHER AS YOU COMMANDED FROM THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY A PLAINTIVE MOAN REACHED CHAUVELIN'S EARS HE FOLLOWED HIS SECRETARY WHO LED THE WAY TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE HUT
7635-105409-0044 WHERE FALLEN INTO AN ABSOLUTE HEAP OF DEJECTION WITH HIS LEGS TIGHTLY PINIONED TOGETHER AND HIS MOUTH GAGGED LAY THE UNFORTUNATE DESCENDANT OF ISRAEL HIS FACE IN THE SILVERY LIGHT OF THE MOON LOOKED POSITIVELY GHASTLY WITH TERROR
7635-105409-0045 WHILE A PITEOUS WAIL ESCAPED HIS BLOODLESS LIPS THE ROPE WHICH HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN WOUND ROUND HIS SHOULDERS AND ARMS HAD EVIDENTLY GIVEN WAY FOR IT LAY IN A TANGLE ABOUT HIS BODY
7635-105409-0046 LIKE A TERRIFIED CHICKEN WHICH LOOKS UPON A LINE OF WHITE CHALK DRAWN ON A TABLE AS ON A STRING WHICH PARALYZES ITS MOVEMENTS BRING THE COWARDLY BRUTE HERE COMMANDED CHAUVELIN
7635-105409-0047 HE CERTAINLY FELT EXCEEDINGLY VICIOUS AND SINCE HE HAD NO REASONABLE GROUNDS FOR VENTING HIS ILL HUMOUR ON THE SOLDIERS WHO HAD BUT TOO PUNCTUALLY OBEYED HIS ORDERS HE FELT THAT THE SON OF THE DESPISED RACE WOULD PROVE AN EXCELLENT BUTT
7635-105409-0048 WITH TRUE FRENCH CONTEMPT OF THE JEW WHICH HAS SURVIVED THE LAPSE OF CENTURIES EVEN TO THIS DAY HE WOULD NOT GO TOO NEAR HIM BUT SAID WITH BITING SARCASM AS THE WRETCHED OLD MAN WAS BROUGHT IN FULL LIGHT OF THE MOON BY THE TWO SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0049 I SUPPOSE NOW THAT BEING A JEW YOU HAVE A GOOD MEMORY FOR BARGAINS ANSWER HE AGAIN COMMANDED AS THE JEW WITH TREMBLING LIPS SEEMED TOO FRIGHTENED TO SPEAK YES YOUR HONOUR STAMMERED THE POOR WRETCH
7635-105409-0050 B BUT YOUR HONOUR THERE IS NO BUT I SAID DO YOU REMEMBER
7635-105409-0051 YOUR HONOUR HE VENTURED IMPLORINGLY SINCE YOUR TERROR SEEMS TO HAVE PARALYZED YOUR TONGUE SAID CHAUVELIN SARCASTICALLY I MUST NEEDS REFRESH YOUR MEMORY
7635-105409-0052 IT WAS AGREED BETWEEN US THAT IF WE OVERTOOK MY FRIEND THE TALL STRANGER BEFORE HE REACHED THIS PLACE YOU WERE TO HAVE TEN PIECES OF GOLD A LOW MOAN ESCAPED FROM THE JEW'S TREMBLING LIPS
7635-105409-0053 BUT ADDED CHAUVELIN WITH SLOW EMPHASIS IF YOU DECEIVED ME IN YOUR PROMISE YOU WERE TO HAVE A SOUND BEATING ONE THAT WOULD TEACH YOU NOT TO TELL LIES I DID NOT YOUR HONOUR I SWEAR IT BY ABRAHAM
7635-105409-0054 AND BY ALL THE OTHER PATRIARCHS I KNOW UNFORTUNATELY THEY ARE STILL IN HADES I BELIEVE ACCORDING TO YOUR CREED AND CANNOT HELP YOU MUCH IN YOUR PRESENT TROUBLE NOW YOU DID NOT FULFIL YOUR SHARE OF THE BARGAIN BUT I AM READY TO FULFIL MINE HERE HE ADDED TURNING TO THE SOLDIERS
7635-105409-0055 I THINK I CAN RELY ON YOU CITOYEN SOLDIERS LAUGHED CHAUVELIN MALICIOUSLY TO GIVE THIS OLD LIAR THE BEST AND SOUNDEST BEATING HE HAS EVER EXPERIENCED BUT DON'T KILL HIM HE ADDED DRILY WE WILL OBEY CITOYEN REPLIED THE SOLDIERS AS IMPERTURBABLY AS EVER
7635-105409-0056 HE DID NOT WAIT TO SEE HIS ORDERS CARRIED OUT HE KNEW THAT HE COULD TRUST THESE SOLDIERS WHO WERE STILL SMARTING UNDER HIS REBUKE NOT TO MINCE MATTERS WHEN GIVEN A FREE HAND TO BELABOUR A THIRD PARTY
7635-105409-0057 THE JEW AND THE WOMAN CAN LOOK AFTER EACH OTHER HE ADDED ROUGHLY UNTIL WE CAN SEND SOMEBODY FOR THEM IN THE MORNING THEY CAN'T RUN AWAY VERY FAR IN THEIR PRESENT CONDITION AND WE CANNOT BE TROUBLED WITH THEM JUST NOW CHAUVELIN HAD NOT GIVEN UP ALL HOPE HIS MEN HE KNEW WERE SPURRED ON BY THE HOPE OF THE REWARD
7635-105409-0058 BUT HE FELT LESS SURE NOW THE ENGLISHMAN'S AUDACITY HAD BAFFLED HIM ONCE WHILST THE WOODEN HEADED STUPIDITY OF THE SOLDIERS AND THE INTERFERENCE OF A WOMAN HAD TURNED HIS HAND WHICH HELD ALL THE TRUMPS INTO A LOSING ONE
7635-105409-0059 IT WAS A LONG IF AND CHAUVELIN STOOD FOR A MOMENT QUITE STILL AND ENROLLED THIRTY ODD PEOPLE IN ONE LONG OVERWHELMING ANATHEMA NATURE POETIC SILENT BALMY THE BRIGHT MOON THE CALM SILVERY SEA SPOKE OF BEAUTY AND OF REST
7635-105409-0060 AND CHAUVELIN CURSED NATURE CURSED MAN AND WOMAN AND ABOVE ALL HE CURSED ALL LONG LEGGED MEDDLESOME BRITISH ENIGMAS WITH ONE GIGANTIC CURSE THE HOWLS OF THE JEW BEHIND HIM UNDERGOING HIS PUNISHMENT SENT A BALM THROUGH HIS HEART
7635-105409-0061 OVERBURDENED AS IT WAS WITH REVENGEFUL MALICE HE SMILED IT EASED HIS MIND TO THINK THAT SOME HUMAN BEING AT LEAST WAS LIKE HIMSELF NOT ALTOGETHER AT PEACE WITH MANKIND HE TURNED AND TOOK A LAST LOOK AT THE LONELY BIT OF COAST WHERE STOOD THE WOODEN HUT NOW BATHED IN MOONLIGHT
7635-105409-0062 THE SCENE OF THE GREATEST DISCOMFITURE EVER EXPERIENCED BY A LEADING MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY AGAINST A ROCK ON A HARD BED OF STONE LAY THE UNCONSCIOUS FIGURE OF MARGUERITE BLAKENEY
7635-105409-0063 WHILE SOME FEW PACES FURTHER ON THE UNFORTUNATE JEW WAS RECEIVING ON HIS BROAD BACK THE BLOWS OF TWO STOUT LEATHER BELTS WIELDED BY THE STOLID ARMS OF TWO STURDY SOLDIERS OF THE REPUBLIC THE HOWLS OF BENJAMIN ROSENBAUM WERE FIT TO MAKE THE DEAD RISE FROM THEIR GRAVES
7635-105409-0064 THAT WILL DO COMMANDED CHAUVELIN AS THE JEW'S MOANS BECAME MORE FEEBLE AND THE POOR WRETCH SEEMED TO HAVE FAINTED AWAY WE DON'T WANT TO KILL HIM
7635-105409-0065 LEAVE HIM THERE SAID CHAUVELIN AND LEAD THE WAY NOW QUICKLY TO THE CART I'LL FOLLOW HE WALKED UP TO WHERE MARGUERITE LAY AND LOOKED DOWN INTO HER FACE
7635-105409-0066 SHE HAD EVIDENTLY RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND WAS MAKING FEEBLE EFFORTS TO RAISE HERSELF HER LARGE BLUE EYES WERE LOOKING AT THE MOONLIT SCENE ROUND HER WITH A SCARED AND TERRIFIED LOOK THEY RESTED WITH A MIXTURE OF HORROR AND PITY ON THE JEW
7635-105409-0067 WITH MOCK GALLANTRY HE STOOPED AND RAISED HER ICY COLD HAND TO HIS LIPS WHICH SENT A THRILL OF INDESCRIBABLE LOATHING THROUGH MARGUERITE'S WEARY FRAME
7635-105409-0068 I MUCH REGRET FAIR LADY HE SAID IN HIS MOST SUAVE TONES THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OVER WHICH I HAVE NO CONTROL COMPEL ME TO LEAVE YOU HERE FOR THE MOMENT BUT I GO AWAY SECURE IN THE KNOWLEDGE THAT I DO NOT LEAVE YOU UNPROTECTED
7635-105409-0069 I HAVE NO DOUBT AT DAWN I WILL SEND AN ESCORT FOR YOU UNTIL THEN I FEEL SURE THAT YOU WILL FIND HIM DEVOTED THOUGH PERHAPS A TRIFLE SLOW MARGUERITE ONLY HAD THE STRENGTH TO TURN HER HEAD AWAY HER HEART WAS BROKEN WITH CRUEL ANGUISH
7635-105409-0070 WHAT HAD BECOME OF PERCY WHAT OF ARMAND SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AFTER SHE HEARD THE CHEERFUL SONG GOD SAVE THE KING WHICH SHE BELIEVED TO BE THE SIGNAL OF DEATH I MYSELF CONCLUDED CHAUVELIN MUST NOW VERY RELUCTANTLY LEAVE YOU
7635-105409-0071 AU REVOIR FAIR LADY WE MEET I HOPE SOON IN LONDON SHALL I SEE YOU AT THE PRINCE OF WALES GARDEN PARTY NO AH WELL AU REVOIR REMEMBER ME I PRAY TO SIR PERCY BLAKENEY
7635-105661-0000 THE PERSONS EMPLOYED IN THE FINANCES ARMIES FLEETS AND MAGISTRACY ARE INSTANCES OF THIS ORDER OF MEN IT MAY NATURALLY BE THOUGHT AT FIRST SIGHT THAT THE ECCLESIASTICS BELONG TO THE FIRST CLASS AND THAT THEIR ENCOURAGEMENT AS WELL AS THAT OF LAWYERS AND PHYSICIANS
7635-105661-0001 MAY SAFELY BE INTRUSTED TO THE LIBERALITY OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ATTACHED TO THEIR DOCTRINES AND WHO FIND BENEFIT OR CONSOLATION FROM THEIR SPIRITUAL MINISTRY AND ASSISTANCE
7635-105661-0002 FROM THEIR INCREASING PRACTICE STUDY AND ATTENTION BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE MATTER MORE CLOSELY WE SHALL FIND THAT THIS INTERESTED DILIGENCE OF THE CLERGY IS WHAT EVERY WISE LEGISLATOR WILL STUDY TO PREVENT BECAUSE IN EVERY RELIGION EXCEPT THE TRUE IT IS HIGHLY PERNICIOUS
7635-105661-0003 AND IT HAS EVEN A NATURAL TENDENCY TO PERVERT THE TRUE BY INFUSING INTO IT A STRONG MIXTURE OF SUPERSTITION FOLLY AND DELUSION EACH GHOSTLY PRACTITIONER IN ORDER TO RENDER HIMSELF MORE PRECIOUS AND SACRED IN THE EYES OF HIS RETAINERS
7635-105661-0004 WILL INSPIRE THEM WITH THE MOST VIOLENT ABHORRENCE OF ALL OTHER SECTS AND CONTINUALLY ENDEAVOR BY SOME NOVELTY TO EXCITE THE LANGUID DEVOTION OF HIS AUDIENCE NO REGARD WILL BE PAID TO TRUTH MORALS OR DECENCY IN THE DOCTRINES INCULCATED
7635-105661-0005 EVERY TENET WILL BE ADOPTED THAT BEST SUITS THE DISORDERLY AFFECTIONS OF THE HUMAN FRAME CUSTOMERS WILL BE DRAWN TO EACH CONVENTICLE BY NEW INDUSTRY AND ADDRESS IN PRACTISING ON THE PASSIONS AND CREDULITY OF THE POPULACE
7635-105661-0006 AND IN THE END THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE WILL FIND THAT HE HAS DEARLY PAID FOR HIS PRETENDED FRUGALITY IN SAVING A FIXED ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE PRIESTS AND THAT IN REALITY THE MOST DECENT AND ADVANTAGEOUS COMPOSITION WHICH HE CAN MAKE WITH THE SPIRITUAL GUIDES
7635-105661-0007 IS TO BRIBE THEIR INDOLENCE BY ASSIGNING STATED SALARIES TO THEIR PROFESSION AND RENDERING IT SUPERFLUOUS FOR THEM TO BE FURTHER ACTIVE THAN MERELY TO PREVENT THEIR FLOCK FROM STRAYING IN QUEST OF NEW PASTURES
7635-105661-0008 AND IN THIS MANNER ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS THOUGH COMMONLY THEY AROSE AT FIRST FROM RELIGIOUS VIEWS PROVE IN THE END ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE POLITICAL INTERESTS OF SOCIETY
7635-105661-0009 BUT WE MAY OBSERVE THAT FEW ECCLESIASTICAL ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN FIXED UPON A WORSE FOUNDATION THAN THAT OF THE CHURCH OF ROME OR HAVE BEEN ATTENDED WITH CIRCUMSTANCES MORE HURTFUL TO THE PEACE AND HAPPINESS OF MANKIND
7635-105661-0010 THE LARGE REVENUES PRIVILEGES IMMUNITIES AND POWERS OF THE CLERGY RENDERED THEM FORMIDABLE TO THE CIVIL MAGISTRATE AND ARMED WITH TOO EXTENSIVE AUTHORITY AN ORDER OF MEN WHO ALWAYS ADHERE CLOSELY TOGETHER
7635-105661-0011 THE HIGHER DIGNITIES OF THE CHURCH SERVED INDEED TO THE SUPPORT OF GENTRY AND NOBILITY BUT BY THE ESTABLISHMENT OF MONASTERIES MANY OF THE LOWEST VULGAR WERE TAKEN FROM THE USEFUL ARTS AND MAINTAINED IN THOSE RECEPTACLES OF SLOTH AND IGNORANCE
7635-105661-0012 THE SUPREME HEAD OF THE CHURCH WAS A FOREIGN POTENTATE GUIDED BY INTERESTS ALWAYS DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF THE COMMUNITY SOMETIMES CONTRARY TO THEM AND AS THE HIERARCHY WAS NECESSARILY SOLICITOUS TO PRESERVE A UNITY OF FAITH RITES AND CEREMONIES
7635-105661-0013 ALL LIBERTY OF THOUGHT RAN A MANIFEST RISK OF BEING EXTINGUISHED AND VIOLENT PERSECUTIONS OR WHAT WAS WORSE A STUPID AND ABJECT CREDULITY TOOK PLACE EVERY WHERE TO INCREASE THESE EVILS THE CHURCH
7635-105661-0014 THOUGH SHE POSSESSED LARGE REVENUES WAS NOT CONTENTED WITH HER ACQUISITIONS
7635-105661-0015 SHE EVEN BESTOWED ON EACH INDIVIDUAL PRIEST A POWER OF ENRICHING HIMSELF BY THE VOLUNTARY OBLATIONS OF THE FAITHFUL AND LEFT HIM STILL AN URGENT MOTIVE FOR DILIGENCE AND INDUSTRY IN HIS CALLING
7635-105661-0016 AND THUS THAT CHURCH THOUGH AN EXPENSIVE AND BURDENSOME ESTABLISHMENT WAS LIABLE TO MANY OF THE INCONVENIENCES WHICH BELONG TO AN ORDER OF PRIESTS TRUSTING ENTIRELY TO THEIR OWN ART AND INVENTION FOR OBTAINING A SUBSISTENCE
7635-105661-0017 THE ADVANTAGES ATTENDING THE ROMISH HIERARCHY WERE BUT A SMALL COMPENSATION FOR ITS INCONVENIENCES THE ECCLESIASTICAL PRIVILEGES DURING BARBAROUS TIMES
7635-105661-0018 AND THE POMP AND SPLENDOR OF WORSHIP WHICH BELONGED TO SO OPULENT AN ESTABLISHMENT CONTRIBUTED IN SOME RESPECT TO THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE FINE ARTS AND BEGAN TO DIFFUSE A GENERAL ELEGANCE OF TASTE BY UNITING IT WITH RELIGION
7635-105661-0019 IT WILL EASILY BE CONCEIVED THAT THOUGH THE BALANCE OF EVIL PREVAILED IN THE ROMISH CHURCH THIS WAS NOT THE CHIEF REASON WHICH PRODUCED THE REFORMATION A CONCURRENCE OF INCIDENTS MUST HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO FORWARD THAT GREAT REVOLUTION
7635-105661-0020 IN ORDER TO SUPPORT HIS PROJECTS PLEASURES AND LIBERALITIES THE SCHEME OF SELLING INDULGENCES WAS SUGGESTED TO HIM AS AN EXPEDIENT WHICH HAD OFTEN SERVED IN FORMER TIMES TO DRAW MONEY FROM THE CHRISTIAN WORLD
7635-105661-0021 AND MAKE DEVOUT PEOPLE WILLING CONTRIBUTORS TO THE GRANDEUR AND RICHES OF THE COURT OF ROME THE CHURCH IT WAS SUPPOSED WAS POSSESSED OF A GREAT STOCK OF MERIT AS BEING ENTITLED TO ALL THE GOOD WORKS OF ALL THE SAINTS BEYOND WHAT WERE EMPLOYED IN THEIR OWN JUSTIFICATION
7635-105661-0022 AND EVEN TO THE MERITS OF CHRIST HIMSELF WHICH WERE INFINITE AND UNBOUNDED AND FROM THIS UNEXHAUSTED TREASURY THE POPE MIGHT RETAIL PARTICULAR PORTIONS AND BY THAT TRAFFIC ACQUIRE MONEY TO BE EMPLOYED IN PIOUS PURPOSES IN RESISTING THE INFIDELS
7635-105661-0023 OR SUBDUING SCHISMATICS WHEN THE MONEY CAME INTO HIS EXCHEQUER THE GREATER PART OF IT WAS USUALLY DIVERTED TO OTHER PURPOSES IT IS COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT LEO FROM THE PENETRATION OF HIS GENIUS AND HIS FAMILIARITY WITH ANCIENT LITERATURE
7635-105661-0024 WAS FULLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE RIDICULE AND FALSITY OF THE DOCTRINES WHICH AS SUPREME PONTIFF
7635-105661-0025 MAY JUSTLY IN PART BE ASCRIBED TO THE LATE INVENTION OF PRINTING AND REVIVAL OF LEARNING NOT THAT REASON BORE ANY CONSIDERABLE SHARE IN OPENING MEN'S EYES WITH REGARD TO THE IMPOSTURES OF THE ROMISH CHURCH FOR OF ALL BRANCHES OF LITERATURE PHILOSOPHY HAD
7635-105661-0026 AS YET AND TILL LONG AFTERWARDS MADE THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS NEITHER IS THERE ANY INSTANCE THAT ARGUMENT HAS EVER BEEN ABLE TO FREE THE PEOPLE FROM THAT ENORMOUS LOAD OF ABSURDITY
7635-105661-0027 WITH WHICH SUPERSTITION HAS EVERY WHERE OVERWHELMED THEM NOT TO MENTION THAT THE RAPID ADVANCE OF THE LUTHERAN DOCTRINE AND THE VIOLENCE WITH WHICH IT WAS EMBRACED PROVE SUFFICIENTLY THAT IT OWED NOT ITS SUCCESS TO REASON AND REFLECTION
7635-105661-0028 WERE PROPAGATED MORE QUICKLY AND IN GREATER NUMBERS THE MINDS OF MEN SOMEWHAT AWAKENED FROM A PROFOUND SLEEP OF SO MANY CENTURIES WERE PREPARED FOR EVERY NOVELTY AND SCRUPLED LESS TO TREAD IN ANY UNUSUAL PATH WHICH WAS OPENED TO THEM
7635-105661-0029 AND AS COPIES OF THE SCRIPTURES AND OTHER ANCIENT MONUMENTS OF THE CHRISTIAN FAITH BECAME MORE COMMON
7635-105661-0030 MANY OF THE POWERS INDEED ASSUMED BY THE CHURCH OF ROME WERE VERY ANCIENT AND WERE PRIOR TO ALMOST EVERY POLITICAL GOVERNMENT ESTABLISHED IN EUROPE
7635-105661-0031 WHICH TIME MIGHT RENDER VALID BUT APPEALED STILL TO A DIVINE ORIGIN MEN WERE TEMPTED TO LOOK INTO THEIR PRIMITIVE CHARTER AND THEY COULD WITHOUT MUCH DIFFICULTY PERCEIVE ITS DEFECT IN TRUTH AND AUTHENTICITY
7635-105661-0032 IN ORDER TO BESTOW ON THIS TOPIC THE GREATER INFLUENCE LUTHER AND HIS FOLLOWERS NOT SATISFIED WITH OPPOSING THE PRETENDED DIVINITY OF THE ROMISH CHURCH AND DISPLAYING THE TEMPORAL INCONVENIENCES OF THAT ESTABLISHMENT
7635-105661-0033 CARRIED MATTERS MUCH FURTHER AND TREATED THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS AS ABOMINABLE DETESTABLE DAMNABLE FORETOLD BY SACRED WRIT ITSELF AS THE SOURCE OF ALL WICKEDNESS AND POLLUTION THEY DENOMINATED THE POPE ANTICHRIST
7635-105661-0034 CALLED HIS COMMUNION THE SCARLET WHORE AND GAVE TO ROME THE APPELLATION OF BABYLON EXPRESSIONS WHICH HOWEVER APPLIED WERE TO BE FOUND IN SCRIPTURE AND WHICH WERE BETTER CALCULATED TO OPERATE ON THE MULTITUDE THAN THE MOST SOLID ARGUMENTS
7635-105661-0035 EXCITED BY CONTEST AND PERSECUTION ON THE ONE HAND BY SUCCESS AND APPLAUSE ON THE OTHER MANY OF THE REFORMERS CARRIED TO THE GREATEST EXTREMITIES THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE CHURCH OF ROME
7635-105661-0036 AND IN CONTRADICTION TO THE MULTIPLIED SUPERSTITIONS WITH WHICH THAT COMMUNION WAS LOADED THEY ADOPTED AN ENTHUSIASTIC STRAIN OF DEVOTION WHICH ADMITTED OF NO OBSERVANCES RITES OR CEREMONIES BUT PLACED ALL MERIT
7635-105661-0037 IN A MYSTERIOUS SPECIES OF FAITH IN INWARD VISION RAPTURE AND ECSTASY THE NEW SECTARIES SEIZED WITH THIS SPIRIT WERE INDEFATIGABLE IN THE PROPAGATION OF THEIR DOCTRINE
7635-105661-0038 AGAINST THE ECCLESIASTICAL JURISDICTION THE LUTHERANS ADVANCED DOCTRINES FAVORABLE IN SOME RESPECT TO THE TEMPORAL AUTHORITY OF SOVEREIGNS THEY INVEIGHED AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0039 IN THOSE POWERS OF WHICH THE ENCROACHING SPIRIT OF THE ECCLESIASTICS ESPECIALLY OF THE SOVEREIGN PONTIFF HAD SO LONG BEREAVED THEM THEY CONDEMNED CELIBACY AND MONASTIC VOWS AND THEREBY OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CONVENTS
7635-105661-0040 TO THOSE WHO WERE EITHER TIRED OF THE OBEDIENCE AND CHASTITY OR DISGUSTED WITH THE LICENSE IN WHICH THEY HAD HITHERTO LIVED THEY BLAMED THE EXCESSIVE RICHES THE IDLENESS
7635-105661-0041 THE LIBERTINISM OF THE CLERGY AND POINTED OUT THEIR TREASURES AND REVENUES AS LAWFUL SPOIL TO THE FIRST INVADER AND AS THE ECCLESIASTICS HAD HITHERTO CONDUCTED A WILLING AND A STUPID AUDIENCE AND WERE TOTALLY UNACQUAINTED WITH CONTROVERSY MUCH MORE
7635-105661-0042 WITH EVERY SPECIES OF TRUE LITERATURE THEY WERE UNABLE TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AGAINST MEN ARMED WITH AUTHORITIES QUOTATIONS AND POPULAR TOPICS AND QUALIFIED TO TRIUMPH IN EVERY ALTERCATION OR DEBATE
7635-105661-0043 DIED IN THE FLOWER OF HIS AGE A LITTLE AFTER HE RECEIVED THE KING'S BOOK AGAINST LUTHER AND HE WAS SUCCEEDED IN THE PAPAL CHAIR BY ADRIAN A FLEMING WHO HAD BEEN TUTOR TO THE EMPEROR CHARLES THIS MAN WAS FITTED TO GAIN ON THE REFORMERS BY THE INTEGRITY CANDOR
7635-105661-0044 AND SIMPLICITY OF MANNERS WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS CHARACTER BUT SO VIOLENT WERE THEIR PREJUDICES AGAINST THE CHURCH HE RATHER HURT THE CAUSE BY HIS IMPRUDENT EXERCISE OF THOSE VIRTUES HE FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT MANY ABOMINABLE AND DETESTABLE PRACTICES PREVAILED IN THE COURT OF ROME
7635-105661-0045 AND BY THIS SINCERE AVOWAL HE GAVE OCCASION OF MUCH TRIUMPH TO THE LUTHERANS THIS PONTIFF ALSO WHOSE PENETRATION WAS NOT EQUAL TO HIS GOOD INTENTIONS WAS SEDUCED TO CONCUR IN THAT LEAGUE WHICH CHARLES AND HENRY HAD FORMED AGAINST FRANCE
7635-105661-0046 AND WHO DREADED THE RESENTMENT OF THAT HAUGHTY MINISTER WAS SOLICITOUS TO REPAIR THE BREACH MADE IN THEIR FRIENDSHIP BY THIS INCIDENT
7635-105661-0047 HE RENEWED TO WOLSEY ALL THE PROMISES WHICH HE HAD MADE HIM OF SECONDING HIS PRETENSIONS TO THE PAPAL THRONE
7635-105661-0048 TO THE NEXT ELECTION THE EMPEROR RENEWED THE TREATY MADE AT BRUGES
7635-105661-0049 THE MORE TO INGRATIATE HIMSELF WITH HENRY AND THE ENGLISH NATION HE GAVE TO SURREY ADMIRAL OF ENGLAND A COMMISSION FOR BEING ADMIRAL OF HIS DOMINIONS AND HE HIMSELF WAS INSTALLED KNIGHT OF THE GARTER AT LONDON
7780-274562-0000 THE AZURE FIELDS OF HEAVEN WERE SEMBLED RIGHT IN A LARGE ROUND SET WITH FLOW'RS OF LIGHT THE FLOWERS DE LUCE AND THE ROUND SPARKS OF DEW THAT HUNG UPON THEIR AZURE LEAVES DID SHOW LIKE TWINKLING STARS THAT SPARKLE IN THE EV'NING BLUE
7780-274562-0001 GILES FLETCHER NO MORE REMARKABLE MAN EVER LIVED THAN MY FRIEND THE YOUNG ELLISON HE WAS REMARKABLE IN THE ENTIRE AND CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS EVER LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE
7780-274562-0002 FROM HIS CRADLE TO HIS GRAVE A GALE OF THE BLANDEST PROSPERITY BORE HIM ALONG NOR DO I USE THE WORD PROSPERITY IN ITS MERE WORDLY OR EXTERNAL SENSE I MEAN IT AS SYNONYMOUS WITH HAPPINESS
7780-274562-0003 THE PERSON OF WHOM I SPEAK SEEMED BORN FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORESHADOWING THE WILD DOCTRINES OF TURGOT PRICE PRIESTLEY AND CONDORCET OF EXEMPLIFYING BY INDIVIDUAL INSTANCE
7780-274562-0004 WHAT HAS BEEN DEEMED THE MERE CHIMERA OF THE PERFECTIONISTS IN THE BRIEF EXISTENCE OF ELLISON I FANCY THAT I HAVE SEEN REFUTED THE DOGMA THAT IN MAN'S PHYSICAL AND SPIRITUAL NATURE LIES SOME HIDDEN PRINCIPLE
7780-274562-0005 THE ANTAGONIST OF BLISS AN INTIMATE AND ANXIOUS EXAMINATION OF HIS CAREER HAS TAUGHT ME TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN GENERAL FROM THE VIOLATION OF A FEW SIMPLE LAWS OF HUMANITY ARISES THE WRETCHEDNESS OF MANKIND
7780-274562-0006 THAT AS A SPECIES WE HAVE IN OUR POSSESSION THE AS YET UNWROUGHT ELEMENTS OF CONTENT AND THAT EVEN NOW IN THE PRESENT BLINDNESS AND DARKNESS OF ALL IDEA ON THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE SOCIAL CONDITION
7780-274562-0007 IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT MAN THE INDIVIDUAL UNDER CERTAIN UNUSUAL AND HIGHLY FORTUITOUS CONDITIONS MAY BE HAPPY WITH OPINIONS SUCH AS THESE WAS MY YOUNG FRIEND FULLY IMBUED
7780-274562-0008 AND THUS IS IT ESPECIALLY WORTHY OF OBSERVATION THAT THE UNINTERRUPTED ENJOYMENT WHICH DISTINGUISHED HIS LIFE WAS IN GREAT PART THE RESULT OF PRECONCERT IT IS INDEED EVIDENT
7780-274562-0009 EXPERIENCE MISTER ELLISON WOULD HAVE FOUND HIMSELF PRECIPITATED BY THE VERY EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESSES OF HIS LIFE INTO THE COMMON VORTEX OF UNHAPPINESS WHICH YAWNS FOR THOSE OF PREEMINENT ENDOWMENTS
7780-274562-0010 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS MY PRESENT OBJECT TO PEN AN ESSAY ON HAPPINESS THE IDEAS OF MY FRIEND MAY BE SUMMED UP IN A FEW WORDS HE ADMITTED BUT FOUR UNVARYING LAWS
7780-274562-0011 OR RATHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF BLISS THAT WHICH HE CONSIDERED CHIEF WAS STRANGE TO SAY THE SIMPLE AND PURELY PHYSICAL ONE OF FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR THE HEALTH HE SAID
7780-274562-0012 ATTAINABLE BY OTHER MEANS THAN THIS IS SCARCELY WORTH THE NAME HE POINTED TO THE TILLERS OF THE EARTH THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO AS A CLASS ARE PROVERBIALLY MORE HAPPY THAN OTHERS
7780-274562-0013 AND THEN HE INSTANCED THE HIGH ECSTASIES OF THE FOX HUNTER HIS SECOND PRINCIPLE WAS THE LOVE OF WOMAN
7780-274562-0014 HIS FOURTH WAS AN OBJECT OF UNCEASING PURSUIT AND HE HELD THAT OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE EXTENT OF HAPPINESS WAS PROPORTIONED TO THE SPIRITUALITY OF THIS OBJECT
7780-274562-0015 I HAVE SAID THAT ELLISON WAS REMARKABLE IN THE CONTINUOUS PROFUSION OF GOOD GIFTS LAVISHED UPON HIM BY FORTUNE IN PERSONAL GRACE AND BEAUTY HE EXCEEDED ALL MEN
7780-274562-0016 HIS INTELLECT WAS OF THAT ORDER TO WHICH THE ATTAINMENT OF KNOWLEDGE IS LESS A LABOR THAN A NECESSITY AND AN INTUITION HIS FAMILY WAS ONE OF THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS OF THE EMPIRE HIS BRIDE WAS THE LOVELIEST AND MOST DEVOTED OF WOMEN
7780-274562-0017 HIS POSSESSIONS HAD BEEN ALWAYS AMPLE BUT UPON THE ATTAINMENT OF HIS ONE AND TWENTIETH YEAR IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT ONE OF THOSE EXTRAORDINARY FREAKS OF FATE HAD BEEN PLAYED IN HIS BEHALF WHICH STARTLE THE WHOLE SOCIAL WORLD AMID WHICH THEY OCCUR
7780-274562-0018 AND SELDOM FAIL RADICALLY TO ALTER THE ENTIRE MORAL CONSTITUTION OF THOSE WHO ARE THEIR OBJECTS IT APPEARS THAT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS PRIOR TO MISTER ELLISON'S ATTAINMENT OF HIS MAJORITY THERE HAD DIED IN A REMOTE PROVINCE
7780-274562-0019 ELLISON THIS GENTLEMEN HAD AMASSED A PRINCELY FORTUNE AND HAVING NO VERY IMMEDIATE CONNEXIONS CONCEIVED THE WHIM OF SUFFERING HIS WEALTH TO ACCUMULATE FOR A CENTURY AFTER HIS DECEASE
7780-274562-0020 MINUTELY AND SAGACIOUSLY DIRECTING THE VARIOUS MODES OF INVESTMENT HE BEQUEATHED THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT TO THE NEAREST OF BLOOD BEARING THE NAME ELLISON WHO SHOULD BE ALIVE AT THE END OF THE HUNDRED YEARS
7780-274562-0021 MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO SET ASIDE THIS SINGULAR BEQUEST THEIR EX POST FACTO CHARACTER RENDERED THEM ABORTIVE
7780-274562-0022 A DECREE FINALLY OBTAINED FORBIDDING ALL SIMILAR ACCUMULATIONS THIS ACT DID NOT PREVENT YOUNG ELLISON UPON HIS TWENTY FIRST BIRTH DAY
7780-274562-0023 FROM ENTERING INTO POSSESSION AS THE HEIR OF HIS ANCESTOR SEABRIGHT OF A FORTUNE OF
7780-274562-0024 THERE WERE OF COURSE MANY SPECULATIONS AS TO THE MODE OF ITS DISPOSAL THE GIGANTIC MAGNITUDE AND THE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE NATURE OF THE SUM DAZZLED AND BEWILDERED ALL WHO THOUGHT UPON THE TOPIC
7780-274562-0025 THE POSSESSOR OF ANY APPRECIABLE AMOUNT OF MONEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMAGINED TO PERFORM ANY ONE OF A THOUSAND THINGS WITH RICHES MERELY SURPASSING THOSE OF ANY CITIZEN
7780-274562-0026 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO SUPPOSE HIM ENGAGING TO SUPREME EXCESS IN THE FASHIONABLE EXTRAVAGANCES OF HIS TIME OR BUSYING HIMSELF WITH POLITICAL INTRIGUES OR AIMING AT MINISTERIAL POWER OR PURCHASING INCREASE OF NOBILITY
7780-274562-0027 OR DEVISING GORGEOUS ARCHITECTURAL PILES OR COLLECTING LARGE SPECIMENS OF VIRTU OR PLAYING THE MUNIFICENT PATRON OF LETTERS AND ART OR ENDOWING AND BESTOWING HIS NAME UPON EXTENSIVE INSTITUTIONS OF CHARITY
7780-274562-0028 BUT FOR THE INCONCEIVABLE WEALTH IN THE ACTUAL POSSESSION OF THE YOUNG HEIR THESE OBJECTS AND ALL ORDINARY OBJECTS WERE FELT TO BE INADEQUATE RECOURSE WAS HAD TO FIGURES
7780-274562-0029 AND FIGURES BUT SUFFICED TO CONFOUND IT WAS SEEN THAT EVEN AT THREE PER CENT THE ANNUAL INCOME OF THE INHERITANCE AMOUNTED TO NO LESS THAN THIRTEEN MILLIONS AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS
7780-274562-0030 WHICH WAS ONE MILLION AND ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND PER MONTH OR THIRTY SIX THOUSAND NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX PER DAY OR ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE PER HOUR OR
7780-274562-0031 SIX AND TWENTY DOLLARS FOR EVERY MINUTE THAT FLEW THUS THE USUAL TRACK OF SUPPOSITION WAS THOROUGHLY BROKEN UP MEN KNEW NOT WHAT TO IMAGINE
7780-274562-0032 ENRICHING WHOLE TROOPS OF HIS RELATIVES BY DIVISION OF HIS SUPERABUNDANCE I WAS NOT SURPRISED HOWEVER
7780-274562-0033 NOR WAS I GREATLY ASTONISHED AT THE NATURE OF HIS DECISION IN THE WIDEST AND NOBLEST SENSE HE WAS A POET HE COMPREHENDED MOREOVER THE TRUE CHARACTER THE AUGUST AIMS
7780-274562-0034 THE SUPREME MAJESTY AND DIGNITY OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT THE PROPER GRATIFICATION OF THE SENTIMENT HE INSTINCTIVELY FELT TO LIE IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL FORMS OF BEAUTY SOME PECULIARITIES EITHER IN HIS EARLY EDUCATION
7780-274562-0035 OR IN THE NATURE OF HIS INTELLECT
7780-274562-0036 AND IT WAS THIS BIAS PERHAPS WHICH IMPERCEPTIBLY LED HIM TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS IF NOT THE SOLE LEGITIMATE FIELD FOR THE EXERCISE OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0037 WAS TO BE FOUND IN THE CREATION OF NOVEL MOODS OF PURELY PHYSICAL LOVELINESS THUS IT HAPPENED THAT HE BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET IF WE USE THIS LATTER TERM IN ITS EVERY DAY ACCEPTATION
7780-274562-0038 OR IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THAT HE BECAME NEITHER THE ONE NOR THE OTHER IN PURSUANCE OF AN IDEA OF HIS WHICH I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THE IDEA THAT IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION LAY ONE OF THE ESSENTIAL PRINCIPLES OF HAPPINESS ON EARTH
7780-274562-0039 IS IT NOT INDEED POSSIBLE THAT WHILE A HIGH ORDER OF GENIUS IS NECESSARILY AMBITIOUS THE HIGHEST IS INVARIABLY ABOVE THAT WHICH IS TERMED AMBITION
7780-274562-0040 AND MAY IT NOT THUS HAPPEN THAT MANY FAR GREATER THAN MILTON HAVE CONTENTEDLY REMAINED MUTE AND INGLORIOUS I BELIEVE THE WORLD HAS NEVER YET SEEN AND THAT
7780-274562-0041 UNLESS THROUGH SOME SERIES OF ACCIDENTS GOADING THE NOBLEST ORDER OF MIND INTO DISTASTEFUL EXERTION THE WORLD WILL NEVER BEHOLD THAT FULL EXTENT OF TRIUMPHANT EXECUTION IN THE RICHER PRODUCTIONS OF ART
7780-274562-0042 OF WHICH THE HUMAN NATURE IS ABSOLUTELY CAPABLE MISTER ELLISON BECAME NEITHER MUSICIAN NOR POET ALTHOUGH NO MAN LIVED MORE PROFOUNDLY ENAMORED BOTH OF MUSIC AND THE MUSE
7780-274562-0043 UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THOSE WHICH INVESTED HIM IT IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE BECOME A PAINTER THE FIELD OF SCULPTURE ALTHOUGH IN ITS NATURE RIGIDLY POETICAL
7780-274562-0044 WAS TOO LIMITED IN ITS EXTENT AND IN ITS CONSEQUENCES TO HAVE OCCUPIED AT ANY TIME MUCH OF HIS ATTENTION AND I HAVE NOW MENTIONED ALL THE PROVINCES IN WHICH
7780-274562-0045 EVEN THE MOST LIBERAL UNDERSTANDING OF THE POETIC SENTIMENT HAS DECLARED THIS SENTIMENT CAPABLE OF EXPATIATING I MEAN THE MOST LIBERAL PUBLIC OR RECOGNIZED CONCEPTION OF THE IDEA INVOLVED IN THE PHRASE POETIC SENTIMENT
7780-274562-0046 NO DEFINITION HAD SPOKEN OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDENER AS OF THE POET YET MY FRIEND COULD NOT FAIL TO PERCEIVE THAT THE CREATION OF THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN OFFERED TO THE TRUE MUSE THE MOST MAGNIFICENT OF OPPORTUNITIES
7780-274562-0047 HERE WAS INDEED THE FAIREST FIELD FOR THE DISPLAY OF INVENTION OR IMAGINATION IN THE ENDLESS COMBINING OF FORMS OF NOVEL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0048 THE ELEMENTS WHICH SHOULD ENTER INTO COMBINATION BEING AT ALL TIMES AND BY A VAST SUPERIORITY THE MOST GLORIOUS WHICH THE EARTH COULD AFFORD IN THE MULTIFORM OF THE TREE
7780-274562-0049 AND IN THE MULTICOLOR OF THE FLOWER HE RECOGNIZED THE MOST DIRECT AND THE MOST ENERGETIC EFFORTS OF NATURE AT PHYSICAL LOVELINESS AND IN THE DIRECTION OR CONCENTRATION OF THIS EFFORT OR
7780-274562-0050 HE PERCEIVED THAT HE SHOULD BE EMPLOYING THE BEST MEANS LABORING TO THE GREATEST ADVANTAGE IN THE FULFILMENT OF HIS DESTINY AS POET
7780-274562-0051 ITS ADAPTATION TO THE EYES WHICH WERE TO BEHOLD IT UPON EARTH IN HIS EXPLANATION OF THIS PHRASEOLOGY MISTER ELLISON DID MUCH TOWARDS SOLVING WHAT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED TO ME AN ENIGMA I MEAN THE FACT
7780-274562-0052 WHICH NONE BUT THE IGNORANT DISPUTE THAT NO SUCH COMBINATIONS OF SCENERY EXIST IN NATURE AS THE PAINTER OF GENIUS HAS IN HIS POWER TO PRODUCE
7780-274562-0053 WHILE THE COMPONENT PARTS MAY EXCEED INDIVIDUALLY THE HIGHEST SKILL OF THE ARTIST THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE PARTS WILL ALWAYS BE SUSCEPTIBLE OF IMPROVEMENT IN SHORT NO POSITION CAN BE ATTAINED
7780-274562-0054 FROM WHICH AN ARTISTICAL EYE LOOKING STEADILY WILL NOT FIND MATTER OF OFFENCE IN WHAT IS TECHNICALLY TERMED THE COMPOSITION OF A NATURAL LANDSCAPE AND YET HOW UNINTELLIGIBLE IS THIS
7780-274562-0055 IN ALL OTHER MATTERS WE ARE JUSTLY INSTRUCTED TO REGARD NATURE AS SUPREME WITH HER DETAILS WE SHRINK FROM COMPETITION WHO SHALL PRESUME TO IMITATE THE COLORS OF THE TULIP OR TO IMPROVE THE PROPORTIONS OF THE LILY OF THE VALLEY
7780-274562-0056 THE CRITICISM WHICH SAYS OF SCULPTURE OR OF PORTRAITURE THAT NATURE IS TO BE EXALTED RATHER THAN IMITATED IS IN ERROR NO PICTORIAL OR SCULPTURAL COMBINATIONS OF POINTS
7780-274562-0057 OF HUMAN LOVELINESS DO MORE THAN APPROACH THE LIVING AND BREATHING HUMAN BEAUTY AS IT GLADDENS OUR DAILY PATH BYRON WHO OFTEN ERRED ERRED NOT IN SAYING I'VE SEEN MORE LIVING BEAUTY
7780-274562-0058 RIPE AND REAL THAN ALL THE NONSENSE OF THEIR STONE IDEAL IN LANDSCAPE ALONE IS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE CRITIC TRUE AND HAVING FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0059 IT IS BUT THE HEADLONG SPIRIT OF GENERALIZATION WHICH HAS INDUCED HIM TO PRONOUNCE IT TRUE THROUGHOUT ALL THE DOMAINS OF ART HAVING I SAY FELT ITS TRUTH HERE
7780-274562-0060 FOR THE FEELING IS NO AFFECTATION OR CHIMERA THE MATHEMATICS AFFORD NO MORE ABSOLUTE DEMONSTRATIONS THAN THE SENTIMENT OF HIS ART YIELDS TO THE ARTIST HE NOT ONLY BELIEVES
7780-274562-0061 BUT POSITIVELY KNOWS THAT SUCH AND SUCH APPARENTLY ARBITRARY ARRANGEMENTS OF MATTER OR FORM CONSTITUTE AND ALONE CONSTITUTE THE TRUE BEAUTY
7780-274562-0062 YET HIS REASONS HAVE NOT YET BEEN MATURED INTO EXPRESSION IT REMAINS FOR A MORE PROFOUND ANALYSIS THAN THE WORLD HAS YET SEEN FULLY TO INVESTIGATE AND EXPRESS THEM
7780-274562-0063 IN HIS INSTINCTIVE OPINIONS BY THE CONCURRENCE OF ALL HIS COMPEERS LET A COMPOSITION BE DEFECTIVE LET AN EMENDATION BE WROUGHT IN ITS MERE ARRANGEMENT OF FORM
7780-274562-0064 LET THIS EMENDATION BE SUBMITTED TO EVERY ARTIST IN THE WORLD BY EACH WILL ITS NECESSITY BE ADMITTED AND EVEN FAR MORE THAN THIS IN REMEDY OF THE DEFECTIVE COMPOSITION
7780-274562-0065 EACH INSULATED MEMBER OF THE FRATERNITY WILL SUGGEST THE IDENTICAL EMENDATION I REPEAT THAT IN LANDSCAPE ARRANGEMENTS OR COLLOCATIONS ALONE IS THE PHYSICAL NATURE SUSCEPTIBLE OF EXALTATION AND THAT
7780-274562-0066 THEREFORE HER SUSCEPTIBILITY OF IMPROVEMENT
7780-274562-0067 IT WAS MISTER ELLISON WHO FIRST SUGGESTED THE IDEA THAT WHAT WE REGARDED AS IMPROVEMENT OR EXALTATION OF THE NATURAL BEAUTY
7780-274562-0068 THAT EACH ALTERATION OR DISTURBANCE OF THE PRIMITIVE SCENERY MIGHT POSSIBLY EFFECT A BLEMISH IN THE PICTURE IF WE COULD SUPPOSE THIS PICTURE VIEWED AT LARGE FROM SOME REMOTE POINT IN THE HEAVENS
7780-274562-0069 IT IS EASILY UNDERSTOOD SAYS MISTER ELLISON THAT WHAT MIGHT IMPROVE A CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED DETAIL MIGHT AT THE SAME TIME INJURE A GENERAL AND MORE DISTANTLY OBSERVED EFFECT
7780-274562-0070 HE SPOKE UPON THIS TOPIC WITH WARMTH REGARDING NOT SO MUCH ITS IMMEDIATE OR OBVIOUS IMPORTANCE WHICH IS LITTLE
7780-274562-0071 OR OF THE COLLATERAL PROPOSITIONS WHICH IT MIGHT SERVE TO CORROBORATE OR SUSTAIN THERE MIGHT BE A CLASS OF BEINGS HUMAN ONCE BUT NOW TO HUMANITY INVISIBLE
7780-274562-0072 FOR WHOSE SCRUTINY AND FOR WHOSE REFINED APPRECIATION OF THE BEAUTIFUL MORE ESPECIALLY THAN FOR OUR OWN HAD BEEN SET IN ORDER BY GOD THE GREAT LANDSCAPE GARDEN OF THE WHOLE EARTH IN THE COURSE OF OUR DISCUSSION
7780-274562-0073 TO HAVE WELL TREATED THIS THEME THERE ARE PROPERLY HE WRITES BUT TWO STYLES OF LANDSCAPE GARDENING THE NATURAL AND THE ARTIFICIAL
7780-274562-0074 ONE SEEKS TO RECALL THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY BY ADAPTING ITS MEANS TO THE SURROUNDING SCENERY CULTIVATING TREES IN HARMONY WITH THE HILLS OR PLAIN OF THE NEIGHBORING LAND
7780-274562-0075 DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR WHICH HID FROM THE COMMON OBSERVER ARE REVEALED EVERYWHERE TO THE EXPERIENCED STUDENT OF NATURE THE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING
7780-274562-0076 IN THE PREVALENCE OF A BEAUTIFUL HARMONY AND ORDER THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES THE ARTIFICIAL STYLE HAS AS MANY VARIETIES AS THERE ARE DIFFERENT TASTES TO GRATIFY
7780-274562-0077 IT HAS A CERTAIN GENERAL RELATION TO THE VARIOUS STYLES OF BUILDING THERE ARE THE STATELY AVENUES AND RETIREMENTS OF VERSAILLES ITALIAN TERRACES AND A VARIOUS MIXED OLD ENGLISH STYLE
7780-274562-0078 WHICH BEARS SOME RELATION TO THE DOMESTIC GOTHIC OR ENGLISH ELIZABETHAN ARCHITECTURE WHATEVER MAY BE SAID AGAINST THE ABUSES OF THE ARTIFICIAL LANDSCAPE GARDENING
7780-274562-0079 A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS PARTLY PLEASING TO THE EYE BY THE SHOW OF ORDER AND DESIGN AND PARTLY MORAL A TERRACE
7780-274562-0080 CALLS UP AT ONCE TO THE EYE THE FAIR FORMS THAT HAVE PASSED THERE IN OTHER DAYS THE SLIGHTEST EXHIBITION OF ART IS AN EVIDENCE OF CARE AND HUMAN INTEREST
7780-274562-0081 FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED SAID MISTER ELLISON YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THAT I REJECT THE IDEA HERE EXPRESSED OF RECALLING THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY OF THE COUNTRY
7780-274562-0082 THE ORIGINAL BEAUTY IS NEVER SO GREAT AS THAT WHICH MAY BE INTRODUCED OF COURSE MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE SELECTION OF A SPOT WITH CAPABILITIES
7780-274562-0083 WHAT IS SAID IN RESPECT TO THE DETECTING AND BRINGING INTO PRACTICE THOSE NICE RELATIONS OF SIZE PROPORTION AND COLOR IS A MERE VAGUENESS OF SPEECH WHICH MAY MEAN MUCH OR LITTLE OR NOTHING
7780-274562-0084 THAT THE TRUE RESULT OF THE NATURAL STYLE OF GARDENING IS SEEN RATHER IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL DEFECTS AND INCONGRUITIES THAN IN THE CREATION OF ANY SPECIAL WONDERS OR MIRACLES
7780-274562-0085 IS A PROPOSITION BETTER SUITED TO THE GROVELLING APPREHENSION OF THE HERD THAN TO THE FERVID DREAMS OF THE MAN OF GENIUS THE MERIT SUGGESTED IS AT BEST NEGATIVE
7780-274562-0086 AND APPERTAINS TO THAT HOBBLING CRITICISM WHICH IN LETTERS WOULD ELEVATE ADDISON INTO APOTHEOSIS IN TRUTH
7780-274562-0087 APPEALS DIRECTLY TO THE UNDERSTANDING AND CAN THUS BE FORESHADOWED IN RULE THE LOFTIER MERIT WHICH BREATHES AND FLAMES IN INVENTION OR CREATION CAN BE APPREHENDED SOLELY IN ITS RESULTS
7780-274562-0088 RULE APPLIES BUT TO THE EXCELLENCES OF AVOIDANCE TO THE VIRTUES WHICH DENY OR REFRAIN BEYOND THESE THE CRITICAL ART CAN BUT SUGGEST
7780-274562-0089 WE MAY BE INSTRUCTED TO BUILD AN ODYSSEY BUT IT IS IN VAIN THAT WE ARE TOLD HOW TO CONCEIVE A TEMPEST AN INFERNO A PROMETHEUS BOUND A NIGHTINGALE
7780-274562-0090 SUCH AS THAT OF KEATS OR THE SENSITIVE PLANT OF SHELLEY BUT THE THING DONE
7780-274562-0091 THE SOPHISTS OF THE NEGATIVE SCHOOL WHO THROUGH INABILITY TO CREATE HAVE SCOFFED AT CREATION ARE NOW FOUND THE LOUDEST IN APPLAUSE WHAT
7780-274562-0092 IN ITS CHRYSALIS CONDITION OF PRINCIPLE AFFRONTED THEIR DEMURE REASON NEVER FAILS IN ITS MATURITY OF ACCOMPLISHMENT TO EXTORT ADMIRATION FROM THEIR INSTINCT OF THE BEAUTIFUL OR OF THE SUBLIME
7780-274562-0093 ARE LESS OBJECTIONABLE A MIXTURE OF PURE ART IN A GARDEN SCENE ADDS TO IT A GREAT BEAUTY THIS IS JUST AND THE REFERENCE TO THE SENSE OF HUMAN INTEREST IS EQUALLY SO
7780-274562-0094 I REPEAT THAT THE PRINCIPLE HERE EXPRESSED IS INCONTROVERTIBLE BUT THERE MAY BE SOMETHING EVEN BEYOND IT THERE MAY BE AN OBJECT IN FULL KEEPING WITH THE PRINCIPLE SUGGESTED
7780-274562-0095 YET WHICH IF ATTAINED WOULD LEND A CHARM TO THE LANDSCAPE GARDEN IMMEASURABLY SURPASSING THAT WHICH A MERELY HUMAN INTEREST COULD BESTOW
7780-274562-0096 SO IMBUE HIS DESIGNS AT ONCE WITH EXTENT AND NOVELTY OF BEAUTY AS TO CONVEY THE SENTIMENT OF SPIRITUAL INTERFERENCE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN BRINGING ABOUT SUCH RESULT
7780-274562-0097 HE SECURES ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF INTEREST OR DESIGN WHILE RELIEVING HIS WORK OF ALL THE HARSHNESS AND TECHNICALITY OF ART
7780-274562-0098 IN THE MOST SAVAGE OF THE SCENES OF PURE NATURE THERE IS APPARENT THE ART OF A CREATOR YET IS THIS ART APPARENT ONLY TO REFLECTION IN NO RESPECT HAS IT THE OBVIOUS FORCE OF A FEELING
7780-274562-0099 NOW IF WE IMAGINE THIS SENSE OF THE ALMIGHTY DESIGN TO BE HARMONIZED IN A MEASURABLE DEGREE IF WE SUPPOSE A LANDSCAPE WHOSE COMBINED STRANGENESS VASTNESS
7780-274562-0100 DEFINITIVENESS AND MAGNIFICENCE SHALL INSPIRE THE IDEA OF CULTURE OR CARE OR SUPERINTENDENCE ON THE PART OF INTELLIGENCES SUPERIOR YET AKIN TO HUMANITY
7780-274562-0101 THEN THE SENTIMENT OF INTEREST IS PRESERVED WHILE THE ART IS MADE TO ASSUME THE AIR OF AN INTERMEDIATE OR SECONDARY NATURE A NATURE WHICH IS NOT GOD NOR AN EMANATION OF GOD
7780-274562-0102 IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS THE HANDIWORK OF THE ANGELS THAT HOVER BETWEEN MAN AND GOD IT WAS IN DEVOTING HIS GIGANTIC WEALTH TO THE PRACTICAL EMBODIMENT OF A VISION SUCH AS THIS
7780-274562-0103 IN THE FREE EXERCISE IN THE OPEN AIR WHICH RESULTED FROM PERSONAL DIRECTION OF HIS PLANS IN THE CONTINUOUS AND UNCEASING OBJECT WHICH THESE PLANS AFFORD
7780-274562-0104 IN THE CONTEMPT OF AMBITION WHICH IT ENABLED HIM MORE TO FEEL THAN TO AFFECT AND LASTLY IT WAS IN THE COMPANIONSHIP AND SYMPATHY OF A DEVOTED WIFE
7780-274562-0105 THAT ELLISON THOUGHT TO FIND AND FOUND AN EXEMPTION FROM THE ORDINARY CARES OF HUMANITY
7794-295947-0000 ON THE SAME ERRAND AS THEMSELVES AS SOON AS THE CHILDREN SAW THE FOXES THEY PICKED UP A BAMBOO STICK AND TOOK THE CREATURES STEALTHILY IN THE REAR AND WHEN THE OLD FOXES TOOK TO FLIGHT THEY SURROUNDED THEM AND BEAT THEM WITH THE STICK
7794-295947-0001 SO THAT THEY RAN AWAY AS FAST AS THEIR LEGS COULD CARRY THEM BUT TWO OF THE BOYS HELD DOWN THE CUB AND SEIZING IT BY THE SCRUFF OF THE NECK WENT OFF IN HIGH GLEE THE TWO FRIENDS WERE LOOKING ON ALL THE WHILE AND ONE OF THEM RAISING HIS VOICE SHOUTED OUT
7794-295947-0002 HALLO YOU BOYS WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH THAT FOX THE ELDEST OF THE BOYS REPLIED WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM HOME AND SELL HIM TO A YOUNG MAN IN OUR VILLAGE HE'LL BUY HIM AND THEN HE'LL BOIL HIM IN A POT AND EAT HIM
7794-295947-0003 WELL REPLIED THE OTHER AFTER CONSIDERING THE MATTER ATTENTIVELY I SUPPOSE IT'S ALL THE SAME TO YOU WHOM YOU SELL HIM TO YOU'D BETTER LET ME HAVE HIM OH BUT THE YOUNG MAN FROM OUR VILLAGE PROMISED US A GOOD SUM IF WE COULD FIND A FOX
7794-295947-0004 AND GOT US TO COME OUT TO THE HILLS AND CATCH ONE AND SO WE CAN'T SELL HIM TO YOU AT ANY PRICE WELL I SUPPOSE IT CANNOT BE HELPED THEN BUT HOW MUCH WOULD THE YOUNG MAN GIVE YOU FOR THE CUB OH HE'LL GIVE US THREE HUNDRED CASH AT LEAST
7794-295947-0005 AND GAVE HALF A BU TO THE THREE BOYS WHO RAN AWAY DELIGHTED THE MAN'S FRIEND UPON THIS SAID TO HIM WELL CERTAINLY YOU HAVE GOT QUEER TASTES WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU GOING TO KEEP THE FOX FOR
7794-295947-0006 HOW COULD I STAND BY AND SEE LIFE TAKEN IT WAS BUT A LITTLE I SPENT ONLY HALF A BU TO SAVE THE CUB BUT HAD IT COST A FORTUNE I SHOULD NOT HAVE GRUDGED IT I THOUGHT YOU WERE INTIMATE ENOUGH WITH ME TO KNOW MY HEART
7794-295947-0007 BUT TO DAY YOU HAVE ACCUSED ME OF BEING ECCENTRIC AND I SEE HOW MISTAKEN I HAVE BEEN IN YOU HOWEVER OUR FRIENDSHIP SHALL CEASE FROM THIS DAY FORTH AND WHEN HE HAD SAID THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF FIRMNESS
7794-295947-0008 THE OTHER RETIRING BACKWARD AND BOWING WITH HIS HANDS ON HIS KNEES REPLIED INDEED INDEED I AM FILLED WITH ADMIRATION AT THE GOODNESS OF YOUR HEART WHEN I HEAR YOU SPEAK THUS I FEEL MORE THAN EVER HOW GREAT IS THE LOVE I BEAR YOU
7794-295947-0009 SO THEY STROKED IT GENTLY ON THE BACK AND PETTED IT AND AS THE PAIN OF THE WOUND SEEMED TO HAVE SUBSIDED THEY WERE ADMIRING THE PROPERTIES OF THE HERB WHEN OPPOSITE TO THEM THEY SAW THE OLD FOXES SITTING WATCHING THEM BY THE SIDE OF SOME STACKS OF RICE STRAW
7794-295947-0010 LOOK THERE THE OLD FOXES HAVE COME BACK OUT OF FEAR FOR THEIR CUB'S SAFETY COME WE WILL SET IT FREE AND WITH THESE WORDS THEY UNTIED THE STRING ROUND THE CUB'S NECK AND TURNED ITS HEAD TOWARD THE SPOT WHERE THE OLD FOXES SAT
7794-295947-0011 SO WITH PEACE IN THEIR HEARTS THE LATTER WENT OFF TO ANOTHER PLACE AND CHOOSING A PRETTY SPOT PRODUCED THE WINE BOTTLE AND ATE THEIR NOONDAY MEAL AND AFTER A PLEASANT DAY THEY RETURNED TO THEIR HOMES AND BECAME FIRMER FRIENDS THAN EVER
7794-295947-0012 NOW THE MAN WHO HAD RESCUED THE FOX'S CUB WAS A TRADESMAN IN GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES HE HAD THREE OR FOUR AGENTS AND TWO MAID SERVANTS BESIDES MEN SERVANTS AND ALTOGETHER HE LIVED IN A LIBERAL MANNER HE WAS MARRIED AND THIS UNION HAD BROUGHT HIM ONE SON
7794-295947-0013 EVEN THOUGH OUR CHILD SHOULD DIE FOR IT THEY SAID WE WILL NOT OURSELVES DEPRIVE OTHER CREATURES OF THEIR LIVES BUT YOU WHO LIVE AMONG THE HILLS ARE SURE TO HEAR WHEN YOUR NEIGHBOURS GO OUT FOX HUNTING
7794-295947-0014 WE DON'T CARE WHAT PRICE WE MIGHT HAVE TO PAY FOR A FOX'S LIVER PRAY BUY ONE FOR US AT ANY EXPENSE SO THEY PRESSED HIM TO EXERT HIMSELF ON THEIR BEHALF AND HE HAVING PROMISED FAITHFULLY TO EXECUTE THE COMMISSION WENT HIS WAY
7794-295947-0015 IN THE NIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING DAY THERE CAME A MESSENGER WHO ANNOUNCED HIMSELF AS COMING FROM THE PERSON WHO HAD UNDERTAKEN TO PROCURE THE FOX'S LIVER SO THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WENT OUT TO SEE HIM I HAVE COME FROM MISTER SO AND SO
7794-295947-0016 LAST NIGHT THE FOX'S LIVER THAT YOU REQUIRED FELL INTO HIS HANDS SO HE SENT ME TO BRING IT TO YOU WITH THESE WORDS THE MESSENGER PRODUCED A SMALL JAR ADDING IN A FEW DAYS HE WILL LET YOU KNOW THE PRICE
7794-295947-0017 WHEN HE HAD DELIVERED HIS MESSAGE THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WAS GREATLY PLEASED AND SAID INDEED I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL FOR THIS KINDNESS WHICH WILL SAVE MY SON'S LIFE THEN THE GOOD WIFE CAME OUT AND RECEIVED THE JAR WITH EVERY MARK OF POLITENESS
7794-295947-0018 WE MUST MAKE A PRESENT TO THE MESSENGER INDEED SIR I'VE ALREADY BEEN PAID FOR MY TROUBLE WELL AT ANY RATE YOU MUST STOP THE NIGHT HERE THANK YOU SIR I'VE A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE WHOM I HAVE NOT SEEN FOR A LONG WHILE
7794-295947-0019 AND I WILL PASS THE NIGHT WITH HIM AND SO HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND WENT AWAY THE PARENTS LOST NO TIME IN SENDING TO LET THE PHYSICIAN KNOW THAT THEY HAD PROCURED THE FOX'S LIVER THE NEXT DAY THE DOCTOR CAME AND COMPOUNDED A MEDICINE FOR THE PATIENT
7794-295947-0020 WHICH AT ONCE PRODUCED A GOOD EFFECT AND THERE WAS NO LITTLE JOY IN THE HOUSEHOLD AS LUCK WOULD HAVE IT THREE DAYS AFTER THIS THE MAN WHOM THEY HAD COMMISSIONED TO BUY THE FOX'S LIVER CAME TO THE HOUSE SO THE GOODWIFE HURRIED OUT TO MEET HIM AND WELCOME HIM
7794-295947-0021 HOW QUICKLY YOU FULFILLED OUR WISHES AND HOW KIND OF YOU TO SEND AT ONCE THE DOCTOR PREPARED THE MEDICINE AND NOW OUR BOY CAN GET UP AND WALK ABOUT THE ROOM AND IT'S ALL OWING TO YOUR GOODNESS WAIT A BIT CRIED THE GUEST
7794-295947-0022 WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF THE JOY OF THE TWO PARENTS THE COMMISSION WITH WHICH YOU ENTRUSTED ME ABOUT THE FOX'S LIVER TURNED OUT TO BE A MATTER OF IMPOSSIBILITY SO I CAME TO DAY TO MAKE MY EXCUSES AND NOW I REALLY CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE SO GRATEFUL TO ME FOR
7794-295947-0023 PRAY INQUIRE CAREFULLY INTO THE MATTER WELL THIS IS VERY STRANGE FOUR NIGHTS AGO A MAN OF SOME FIVE OR SIX AND THIRTY YEARS OF AGE CAME WITH A VERBAL MESSAGE FROM YOU TO THE EFFECT THAT YOU HAD SENT HIM WITH A FOX'S LIVER
7794-295947-0024 WHICH YOU HAD JUST PROCURED AND SAID THAT HE WOULD COME AND TELL US THE PRICE ANOTHER DAY WHEN WE ASKED HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT HERE HE ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD LODGE WITH A RELATION IN THE NEXT VILLAGE AND WENT AWAY THE VISITOR WAS MORE AND MORE LOST IN AMAZEMENT AND
7794-295947-0025 LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS TAKING OUT MY CUB TO PLAY IT WAS CARRIED OFF BY SOME BOYS AND ONLY SAVED BY YOUR GOODNESS THE DESIRE TO REQUITE THIS KINDNESS PIERCED ME TO THE QUICK AT LAST WHEN CALAMITY ATTACKED YOUR HOUSE
7794-295947-0026 I THOUGHT I MIGHT BE OF USE TO YOU YOUR SON'S ILLNESS COULD NOT BE CURED WITHOUT A LIVER TAKEN FROM A LIVE FOX SO TO REPAY YOUR KINDNESS I KILLED MY CUB AND TOOK OUT ITS LIVER THEN ITS SIRE DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER
7794-295947-0027 BROUGHT IT TO YOUR HOUSE AND AS SHE SPOKE THE FOX SHED TEARS AND THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WISHING TO THANK HER MOVED IN BED UPON WHICH HIS WIFE AWOKE AND ASKED HIM WHAT WAS THE MATTER BUT HE TOO TO HER GREAT ASTONISHMENT
7794-295947-0028 WAS BITING THE PILLOW AND WEEPING BITTERLY WHY ARE YOU WEEPING THUS ASKED SHE AT LAST HE SAT UP IN BED AND SAID LAST SPRING WHEN I WAS OUT ON A PLEASURE EXCURSION I WAS THE MEANS OF SAVING THE LIFE OF A FOX'S CUB
7794-295947-0029 AS I TOLD YOU AT THE TIME THE OTHER DAY I TOLD MISTER SO AND SO THAT ALTHOUGH MY SON WERE TO DIE BEFORE MY EYES I WOULD NOT BE THE MEANS OF KILLING A FOX ON PURPOSE BUT ASKED HIM IN CASE HE HEARD OF ANY HUNTER KILLING A FOX
7794-295947-0030 TO BUY IT FOR ME HOW THE FOXES CAME TO HEAR OF THIS I DON'T KNOW BUT THE FOXES TO WHOM I HAD SHOWN KINDNESS KILLED THEIR OWN CUB AND TOOK OUT THE LIVER AND THE OLD DOG FOX DISGUISING HIMSELF AS A MESSENGER FROM THE PERSON TO WHOM
7794-295947-0031 WE HAD CONFIDED THE COMMISSION CAME HERE WITH IT HIS MATE HAS JUST BEEN AT MY PILLOW SIDE AND TOLD ME ALL ABOUT IT HENCE IT WAS THAT IN SPITE OF MYSELF I WAS MOVED TO TEARS
7794-295947-0032 WHEN SHE HEARD THIS THE GOODWIFE LIKEWISE WAS BLINDED BY HER TEARS AND FOR A WHILE THEY LAY LOST IN THOUGHT BUT AT LAST COMING TO THEMSELVES THEY LIGHTED THE LAMP ON THE SHELF ON WHICH THE FAMILY IDOL STOOD
7794-295947-0033 AND SPENT THE NIGHT IN RECITING PRAYERS AND PRAISES AND THE NEXT DAY THEY PUBLISHED THE MATTER TO THE HOUSEHOLD AND TO THEIR RELATIONS AND FRIENDS NOW ALTHOUGH THERE ARE INSTANCES OF MEN KILLING THEIR OWN CHILDREN TO REQUITE A FAVOUR
7794-295947-0034 THERE IS NO OTHER EXAMPLE OF FOXES HAVING DONE SUCH A THING SO THE STORY BECAME THE TALK OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY NOW THE BOY WHO HAD RECOVERED THROUGH THE EFFICACY OF THIS MEDICINE SELECTED THE PRETTIEST SPOT ON THE PREMISES
7794-295947-0035 THE SAINTS WHO ARE WORSHIPPED IN JAPAN WRITES A NATIVE AUTHORITY ARE MEN WHO IN THE REMOTE AGES WHEN THE COUNTRY WAS DEVELOPING ITSELF WERE SAGES AND BY THEIR GREAT AND VIRTUOUS DEEDS HAVING EARNED THE GRATITUDE OF FUTURE GENERATIONS
7794-295947-0036 ALL MATTERS CONNECTED WITH THE SHRINES OF THE SHINTO OR INDIGENOUS RELIGION ARE CONFIDED TO THE SUPERINTENDENCE OF THE FAMILIES OF YOSHIDA AND FUSHIMI
7794-295947-0037 THE AFFAIRS OF THE BUDDHIST OR IMPORTED RELIGION ARE UNDER THE CARE OF THE FAMILY OF KANJUJI AS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THOSE WHO AS PRIESTS PERFORM THE HONOURABLE OFFICE OF SERVING THE GODS SHOULD BE PERSONS OF SOME STANDING
7794-295947-0038 A CERTAIN SMALL RANK IS PROCURED FOR THEM THROUGH THE INTERVENTION OF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ABOVE NOBLE FAMILIES WHO ON THE ISSUING OF THE REQUIRED PATENT RECEIVE AS THEIR PERQUISITE A FEE WHICH ALTHOUGH INSIGNIFICANT IN ITSELF
7794-295947-0039 WHOSE PENNILESS CONDITION FORMS A GREAT CONTRAST TO THE WEALTH OF THEIR INFERIORS IN RANK THE DAIMIOS I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE ONLY CASE IN WHICH RANK CAN BE BOUGHT OR SOLD IN JAPAN
7794-295947-0040 IN CHINA ON THE CONTRARY IN SPITE OF WHAT HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MEADOWS AND OTHER ADMIRERS OF THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM A MAN CAN BE WHAT HE PLEASES BY PAYING FOR IT
7794-295947-0041 ARE LOCALLY WORSHIPPED TOUCHING THE REMEDY OF THE FOX'S LIVER PRESCRIBED IN THE TALE I MAY ADD THAT THERE WOULD BE NOTHING STRANGE IN THIS TO A PERSON ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHINESE PHARMACOPOEIA WHICH THE JAPANESE LONG EXCLUSIVELY FOLLOWED
7794-295947-0042 ALTHOUGH THEY ARE NOW SUCCESSFULLY STUDYING THE ART OF HEALING AS PRACTISED IN THE WEST WHEN I WAS AT PEKING I SAW A CHINESE PHYSICIAN PRESCRIBE A DECOCTION OF THREE SCORPIONS FOR A CHILD STRUCK DOWN WITH FEVER
7794-295947-0043 AND ON ANOTHER OCCASION A GROOM OF MINE SUFFERING FROM DYSENTERY WAS TREATED WITH ACUPUNCTURE OF THE TONGUE THE ART OF MEDICINE WOULD APPEAR TO BE AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CHINA MUCH IN THE STATE IN WHICH IT EXISTED IN EUROPE IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY
7794-295947-0044 FOR RETENTION CAUSED BY EITHER RENAL OR VESICAL CALCULI BUT I HAVE MYSELF THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED THE UTILITY OF AN OIL I MAKE MYSELF WHEREOF SCORPIONS FORM A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS
7794-295947-0045 IF ONLY THE REGION OF THE HEART AND ALL THE PULSES OF THE BODY BE ANOINTED WITH IT IT WILL FREE THE PATIENTS FROM THE EFFECTS OF ALL KINDS OF POISONS TAKEN BY THE MOUTH CORROSIVE ONES EXCEPTED DECOCTIONS OF EGYPTIAN MUMMIES WERE MUCH COMMENDED
7794-295947-0046 AND OFTEN PRESCRIBED WITH DUE ACADEMICAL SOLEMNITY AND THE BONES OF THE HUMAN SKULL PULVERIZED AND ADMINISTERED WITH OIL WERE USED AS A SPECIFIC IN CASES OF RENAL CALCULUS SEE PETRI ANDREAE MATTHIOLI OPERA FIFTEEN SEVENTY FOUR
7794-295948-0000 NIGHT AND MORNING HE RECITED THE PRAYER
7794-295948-0001 ALTHOUGH THE FAME OF HIS VIRTUE DID NOT REACH FAR YET HIS NEIGHBOURS RESPECTED AND REVERED HIM
7794-295948-0002 AND WHEN HIS ROOF OR HIS WALLS FELL OUT OF REPAIR THEY WOULD MEND THEM FOR HIM SO FOR THE THINGS OF THIS WORLD HE TOOK NO THOUGHT ONE VERY COLD NIGHT WHEN HE LITTLE THOUGHT ANY ONE WAS OUTSIDE HE HEARD A VOICE CALLING
7794-295948-0003 YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE SO HE ROSE AND WENT OUT TO SEE WHO IT WAS AND THERE HE BEHELD AN OLD BADGER STANDING ANY ORDINARY MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN GREATLY ALARMED AT THE APPARITION
7794-295948-0004 BUT NOW I AM GROWING OLD AND THIS SEVERE COLD IS MORE THAN I CAN BEAR I PRAY YOU TO LET ME ENTER AND WARM MYSELF AT THE FIRE OF YOUR COTTAGE THAT I MAY LIVE THROUGH THIS BITTER NIGHT
7794-295948-0005 WENT INTO THE HUT AND SQUATTING DOWN BY THE FIRE BEGAN TO WARM ITSELF AND THE PRIEST WITH RENEWED FERVOUR RECITED HIS PRAYERS AND STRUCK HIS BELL BEFORE THE IMAGE OF BUDDHA LOOKING STRAIGHT BEFORE HIM
7794-295948-0006 AFTER TWO HOURS THE BADGER TOOK ITS LEAVE WITH PROFUSE EXPRESSIONS OF THANKS AND WENT OUT AND FROM THAT TIME FORTH IT CAME EVERY NIGHT TO THE HUT AS THE BADGER WOULD COLLECT AND BRING WITH IT DRIED BRANCHES AND DEAD LEAVES FROM THE HILLS FOR FIREWOOD
7794-295948-0007 THE PRIEST AT LAST BECAME VERY FRIENDLY WITH IT AND GOT USED TO ITS COMPANY SO THAT IF EVER AS THE NIGHT WORE ON THE BADGER DID NOT ARRIVE HE USED TO MISS IT AND WONDER WHY IT DID NOT COME
7794-295948-0008 AND EVEN AFTER MY DEATH I MUST REMEMBER THEM WHAT CAN I DO TO REQUITE THEM IF THERE IS ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH FOR PRAY TELL ME THE PRIEST SMILING AT THIS SPEECH ANSWERED
7794-295948-0009 BEING SUCH AS I AM I HAVE NO DESIRE AND NO WISHES GLAD AS I AM TO HEAR YOUR KIND INTENTIONS THERE IS NOTHING THAT I CAN ASK YOU TO DO FOR ME YOU NEED FEEL NO ANXIETY ON MY ACCOUNT AS LONG AS I LIVE WHEN THE WINTER COMES
7794-295948-0010 YOU SHALL BE WELCOME HERE THE BADGER ON HEARING THIS COULD NOT CONCEAL ITS ADMIRATION OF THE DEPTH OF THE OLD MAN'S BENEVOLENCE BUT HAVING SO MUCH TO BE GRATEFUL FOR IT FELT HURT AT NOT BEING ABLE TO REQUITE IT
7794-295948-0011 AS THIS SUBJECT WAS OFTEN RENEWED BETWEEN THEM THE PRIEST AT LAST TOUCHED BY THE GOODNESS OF THE BADGER'S HEART SAID SINCE I HAVE SHAVEN MY HEAD RENOUNCED THE WORLD AND FORSAKEN THE PLEASURES OF THIS LIFE I HAVE NO DESIRE TO GRATIFY
7794-295948-0012 YET I OWN I SHOULD LIKE TO POSSESS THREE RIYOS IN GOLD FOOD AND RAIMENT I RECEIVE BY THE FAVOUR OF THE VILLAGERS SO I TAKE NO HEED FOR THOSE THINGS WERE I TO DIE TO MORROW AND ATTAIN MY WISH OF BEING BORN AGAIN INTO THE NEXT WORLD
7794-295948-0013 THE SAME KIND FOLK HAVE PROMISED TO MEET AND BURY MY BODY THUS ALTHOUGH I HAVE NO OTHER REASON TO WISH FOR MONEY STILL IF I HAD THREE RIYOS I WOULD OFFER THEM UP AT SOME HOLY SHRINE THAT MASSES AND PRAYERS MIGHT BE SAID FOR ME
7794-295948-0014 WHEREBY I MIGHT ENTER INTO SALVATION YET I WOULD NOT GET THIS MONEY BY VIOLENT OR UNLAWFUL MEANS I ONLY THINK OF WHAT MIGHT BE IF I HAD IT SO YOU SEE SINCE YOU HAVE EXPRESSED SUCH KIND FEELINGS TOWARD ME
7794-295948-0015 I HAVE TOLD YOU WHAT IS ON MY MIND WHEN THE PRIEST HAD DONE SPEAKING THE BADGER LEANT ITS HEAD ON ONE SIDE WITH A PUZZLED AND ANXIOUS LOOK SO MUCH SO THAT THE OLD MAN WAS SORRY HE HAD EXPRESSED A WISH WHICH SEEMED TO GIVE THE BEAST TROUBLE
7794-295948-0016 AND TRIED TO RETRACT WHAT HE HAD SAID POSTHUMOUS HONOURS AFTER ALL ARE THE WISH OF ORDINARY MEN I WHO AM A PRIEST OUGHT NOT TO ENTERTAIN SUCH THOUGHTS OR TO WANT MONEY SO PRAY PAY NO ATTENTION TO WHAT I HAVE SAID
7794-295948-0017 AND THE BADGER FEIGNING ASSENT TO WHAT THE PRIEST HAD IMPRESSED UPON IT RETURNED TO THE HILLS AS USUAL FROM THAT TIME FORTH THE BADGER CAME NO MORE TO THE HUT
7794-295948-0018 THE PRIEST THOUGHT THIS VERY STRANGE BUT IMAGINED EITHER THAT THE BADGER STAYED AWAY BECAUSE IT DID NOT LIKE TO COME WITHOUT THE MONEY OR THAT IT HAD BEEN KILLED IN AN ATTEMPT TO STEAL IT AND HE BLAMED HIMSELF FOR HAVING ADDED TO HIS SINS FOR NO PURPOSE
7794-295948-0019 REPENTING WHEN IT WAS TOO LATE PERSUADED HOWEVER THAT THE BADGER MUST HAVE BEEN KILLED HE PASSED HIS TIME IN PUTTING UP PRAYERS UPON PRAYERS FOR IT AFTER THREE YEARS HAD GONE BY ONE NIGHT
7794-295948-0020 THE OLD MAN HEARD A VOICE NEAR HIS DOOR CALLING OUT YOUR REVERENCE YOUR REVERENCE AS THE VOICE WAS LIKE THAT OF THE BADGER HE JUMPED UP AS SOON AS HE HEARD IT AND RAN TO OPEN THE DOOR AND THERE SURE ENOUGH WAS THE BADGER
7794-295948-0021 IF THE MONEY WHICH YOU REQUIRED HAD BEEN FOR UNLAWFUL PURPOSES I COULD EASILY HAVE PROCURED AS MUCH AS EVER YOU MIGHT HAVE WANTED BUT WHEN I HEARD THAT IT WAS TO BE OFFERED TO A TEMPLE FOR MASSES FOR YOUR SOUL
7794-295948-0022 FUSED IT AFRESH IN THE FIRE AND AT THIS WORK I SPENT MONTHS AND DAYS AS THE BADGER FINISHED SPEAKING THE PRIEST LOOKED AT THE MONEY WHICH IT HAD PRODUCED AND SURE ENOUGH HE SAW THAT IT WAS BRIGHT AND NEW AND CLEAN
7794-295948-0023 AS HE WAS THANKING THE BADGER WITH GREAT POLITENESS AND CEREMONY THE BEAST SAID IN DOING THIS I HAVE BUT FULFILLED MY OWN WISH STILL I HOPE THAT YOU WILL TELL THIS THING TO NO MAN INDEED REPLIED THE PRIEST
7794-295948-0024 BUT I SHALL SAY THAT THE BADGER THAT GAVE ME THE MONEY HAS CEASED COMING TO MY HUT YOU NEED NOT FEAR BEING WAYLAID BUT CAN COME AS OF OLD AND SHELTER YOURSELF FROM THE COLD TO THIS THE BADGER NODDED ASSENT AND AS LONG AS THE OLD PRIEST LIVED
7794-295948-0025 IT CAME AND SPENT THE WINTER NIGHTS WITH HIM FROM THIS STORY IT IS PLAIN THAT EVEN BEASTS HAVE A SENSE OF GRATITUDE IN THIS QUALITY DOGS EXCEL ALL OTHER BEASTS
7794-295948-0026 WRITTEN IN THE ANNALS OF JAPAN
7794-295955-0000 THEN THE MIDDLE SON WENT HUNTING AND AS HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN A HARE SPRANG OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT
7794-295955-0001 BUT IT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON WHICH WAITED FOR AND DEVOURED HIM WHEN SOME DAYS HAD ELAPSED AND THE PRINCES DID NOT RETURN EITHER OF THEM THE WHOLE COURT WAS IN SORROW
7794-295955-0002 THEN THE THIRD SON WENT HUNTING TO SEE WHETHER HE COULD NOT FIND HIS BROTHERS WHEN HE ISSUED FROM THE TOWN AGAIN UP SPRANG A HARE OUT OF A BUSH AND THE PRINCE AFTER IT AND HITHER AND THITHER TILL THE HARE FLED INTO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0003 BUT THE PRINCE DID NOT CHOOSE TO FOLLOW IT BUT WENT TO FIND OTHER GAME SAYING TO HIMSELF WHEN I RETURN I SHALL FIND YOU AFTER THUS HE WENT FOR A LONG TIME UP AND DOWN THE HILL BUT FOUND NOTHING AND THEN RETURNED TO THE WATER MILL
7794-295955-0004 SHE REPLIED MY SON THAT WAS NOT A HARE BUT A DRAGON IT KILLS AND THROTTLES MANY PEOPLE HEARING THIS THE PRINCE WAS SOMEWHAT DISTURBED AND SAID TO THE OLD WOMAN WHAT SHALL WE DO NOW DOUBTLESS MY TWO BROTHERS ALSO HAVE PERISHED HERE
7794-295955-0005 THE OLD WOMAN ANSWERED THEY HAVE INDEED BUT THERE'S NO HELP FOR IT GO HOME MY SON LEST YOU FOLLOW THEM THEN HE SAID TO HER DEAR OLD WOMAN DO YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW THAT YOU WILL BE GLAD TO LIBERATE YOURSELF FROM THAT PEST
7794-295955-0006 THE OLD WOMAN INTERRUPTED HIM HOW SHOULD I NOT IT CAPTURED ME TOO IN THIS WAY BUT NOW I HAVE NO MEANS OF ESCAPE THEN HE PROCEEDED LISTEN WELL TO WHAT I AM GOING TO SAY TO YOU ASK IT WHITHER IT GOES AND WHERE ITS STRENGTH IS
7794-295955-0007 WHEN THE DRAGON CAME IN THE OLD WOMAN BEGAN TO QUESTION IT WHERE IN GOD'S NAME HAVE YOU BEEN WHITHER DO YOU GO SO FAR YOU WILL NEVER TELL ME WHITHER YOU GO THE DRAGON REPLIED WELL MY DEAR OLD WOMAN I DO GO FAR
7794-295955-0008 MY STRENGTH IS A LONG WAY OFF AND YOU CANNOT GO THITHER FAR IN ANOTHER EMPIRE UNDER THE EMPEROR'S CITY IS A LAKE IN THAT LAKE IS A DRAGON AND IN THAT DRAGON A BOAR AND IN THE BOAR A PIGEON AND IN THAT IS MY STRENGTH
7794-295955-0009 TOOK A SHEPHERD'S STAFF IN HIS HAND AND WENT INTO THE WORLD AS HE WENT ON THUS FROM VILLAGE TO VILLAGE AND FROM TOWN TO TOWN AT LAST HE CAME INTO ANOTHER EMPIRE AND INTO THE IMPERIAL CITY IN A LAKE UNDER WHICH THE DRAGON WAS
7794-295955-0010 ON GOING INTO THE TOWN HE BEGAN TO INQUIRE WHO WANTED A SHEPHERD THE CITIZENS TOLD HIM THAT THE EMPEROR DID THEN HE WENT STRAIGHT TO THE EMPEROR AFTER HE ANNOUNCED HIMSELF THE EMPEROR ADMITTED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND ASKED HIM
7794-295955-0011 AND WHEN YOU CALL THE SHEEP OUT THEY GO THITHER AT ONCE AND SPREAD THEMSELVES ROUND THE LAKE BUT WHATEVER SHEPHERD GOES OFF THERE THAT SHEPHERD RETURNS BACK NO MORE THEREFORE MY SON I TELL YOU
7794-295955-0012 DON'T LET THE SHEEP HAVE THEIR OWN WAY AND GO WHERE THEY WILL BUT KEEP THEM WHERE YOU WILL THE PRINCE THANKED THE EMPEROR GOT HIMSELF READY AND CALLED OUT THE SHEEP TAKING WITH HIM MORE OVER TWO HOUNDS THAT COULD CATCH A BOAR IN THE OPEN COUNTRY
7794-295955-0013 AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND BEGAN TO SHOUT DRAGON DRAGON COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME TO DAY
7794-295955-0014 LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND TOSS YOU TO THE SKY BUT THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU STILL HIGHER
7794-295955-0015 BECAUSE HE HAD COME WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY NO SHEPHERD HAD BEEN ABLE TO COME FROM THE LAKE THE NEXT DAY THE PRINCE GOT READY AGAIN AND WENT WITH HIS SHEEP STRAIGHT TO THE LAKE BUT THE EMPEROR SENT TWO GROOMS AFTER HIM TO GO STEALTHILY AND SEE WHAT HE DID
7794-295955-0016 AND THEY PLACED THEMSELVES ON A HIGH HILL WHENCE THEY COULD HAVE A GOOD VIEW WHEN THE SHEPHERD ARRIVED HE PUT THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER THE STUMP AND THE FALCON UPON IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE LAKE AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0017 COME OUT TO SINGLE COMBAT WITH ME THAT WE MAY MEASURE OURSELVES ONCE MORE TOGETHER UNLESS YOU ARE A WOMAN THE DRAGON REPLIED I WILL DO SO PRINCE NOW NOW ERELONG BEHOLD THE DRAGON IT WAS LARGE IT WAS TERRIBLE
7794-295955-0018 IT WAS DISGUSTING AND IT SEIZED HIM BY THE WAIST AND WRESTLED WITH HIM A SUMMER'S DAY TILL AFTERNOON BUT WHEN THE AFTERNOON HEAT CAME ON THE DRAGON SAID LET ME GO PRINCE THAT I MAY MOISTEN MY PARCHED HEAD IN THE LAKE AND MAY TOSS YOU TO THE SKY
7794-295955-0019 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED THE PRINCE DROVE THE SHEEP AS BEFORE AND WENT HOME PLAYING THE BAGPIPES WHEN HE ARRIVED AT THE TOWN THE WHOLE TOWN WAS ASTIR AND BEGAN TO WONDER BECAUSE THE SHEPHERD CAME HOME EVERY EVENING WHICH NO ONE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO BEFORE
7794-295955-0020 THOSE TWO GROOMS HAD ALREADY ARRIVED AT THE PALACE BEFORE THE PRINCE AND RELATED TO THE EMPEROR IN ORDER EVERYTHING THAT THEY HAD HEARD AND SEEN NOW WHEN THE EMPEROR SAW THAT THE SHEPHERD RETURNED HOME HE IMMEDIATELY SUMMONED HIS DAUGHTER INTO HIS PRESENCE AND TOLD HER ALL
7794-295955-0021 AND I AM YOUR ONLY DAUGHTER AND YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT ME IF I PERISH THEN THE EMPEROR BEGAN TO PERSUADE AND ENCOURAGE HER DON'T FEAR MY DAUGHTER YOU SEE WE HAVE HAD SO MANY CHANGES OF SHEPHERDS AND OF ALL THAT WENT OUT TO THE LAKE NOT ONE HAS RETURNED
7794-295955-0022 SO MANY PEOPLE WHEN ON THE MORROW THE DAY DAWNED AND THE SUN CAME FORTH UP ROSE THE SHEPHERD UP ROSE THE MAIDEN TOO TO BEGIN TO PREPARE FOR GOING TO THE LAKE THE SHEPHERD WAS CHEERFUL MORE CHEERFUL THAN EVER
7794-295955-0023 BUT THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER WAS SAD AND SHED TEARS THE SHEPHERD COMFORTED HER LADY SISTER I PRAY YOU DO NOT WEEP BUT DO WHAT I TELL YOU WHEN IT IS TIME RUN UP AND KISS ME AND FEAR NOT AS HE WENT AND DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0024 WHEN THEY ARRIVED AT THE LAKE THE SHEEP IMMEDIATELY SPREAD ROUND IT AND THE PRINCE PLACED THE FALCON ON THE STUMP AND THE HOUNDS AND BAGPIPES UNDER IT THEN TUCKED UP HIS HOSE AND SLEEVES WADED INTO THE WATER AND SHOUTED DRAGON DRAGON
7794-295955-0025 THE PRINCE REPLIED COME DRAGON DON'T TALK NONSENSE IF I HAD THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER TO KISS ME ON THE FOREHEAD I WOULD TOSS YOU MUCH HIGHER WHEN HE SAID THIS THE EMPEROR'S DAUGHTER RAN UP AND KISSED HIM ON THE FACE ON THE EYE AND ON THE FOREHEAD
7794-295955-0026 THEN HE SWUNG THE DRAGON AND TOSSED IT HIGH INTO THE AIR AND WHEN IT FELL TO THE GROUND IT BURST INTO PIECES BUT AS IT BURST INTO PIECES OUT OF IT SPRANG A WILD BOAR AND STARTED TO RUN AWAY BUT THE PRINCE SHOUTED TO HIS SHEPHERD DOGS
7794-295955-0027 HOLD IT DON'T LET IT GO AND THE DOGS SPRANG UP AND AFTER IT CAUGHT IT AND SOON TORE IT TO PIECES BUT OUT OF THE BOAR FLEW A PIGEON AND THE PRINCE LOOSED THE FALCON AND THE FALCON CAUGHT THE PIGEON
7794-295955-0028 CUT THESE THREE WANDS UP FROM BELOW AND STRIKE WITH THEM UPON THEIR ROOT AN IRON DOOR WILL IMMEDIATELY OPEN INTO A LARGE VAULT IN THAT VAULT ARE MANY PEOPLE OLD AND YOUNG RICH AND POOR SMALL AND GREAT WIVES AND MAIDENS
7794-295955-0029 SO THAT YOU COULD SETTLE A POPULOUS EMPIRE THERE TOO ARE YOUR BROTHERS WHEN THE PIGEON HAD TOLD HIM ALL THIS THE PRINCE IMMEDIATELY WRUNG ITS NECK THE EMPEROR HAD GONE OUT IN PERSON
7794-295955-0030 HE WASHED HIMSELF NICELY TOOK THE FALCON ON HIS SHOULDER THE HOUNDS BEHIND HIM AND THE BAGPIPES UNDER HIS ARM PLAYED AS HE WENT DROVE THE SHEEP
7794-295955-0031 WHEN THEY CAME TO THE TOWN ALL THE TOWN ASSEMBLED AS TO SEE A WONDER THE EMPEROR WHO HAD SEEN ALL HIS HEROISM FROM THE HILL CALLED HIM INTO HIS PRESENCE AND GAVE HIM HIS DAUGHTER WENT IMMEDIATELY TO CHURCH HAD THEM MARRIED AND HELD A WEDDING FESTIVAL FOR A WEEK
78-368-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY THREE IT WAS EIGHT O'CLOCK WHEN WE LANDED WE WALKED FOR A SHORT TIME ON THE SHORE ENJOYING THE TRANSITORY LIGHT AND THEN RETIRED TO THE INN
78-368-0001 THE WIND WHICH HAD FALLEN IN THE SOUTH NOW ROSE WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN THE WEST THE MOON HAD REACHED HER SUMMIT IN THE HEAVENS AND WAS BEGINNING TO DESCEND
78-368-0002 THE CLOUDS SWEPT ACROSS IT SWIFTER THAN THE FLIGHT OF THE VULTURE AND DIMMED HER RAYS WHILE THE LAKE REFLECTED THE SCENE OF THE BUSY HEAVENS RENDERED STILL BUSIER BY THE RESTLESS WAVES
78-368-0003 THAT WERE BEGINNING TO RISE SUDDENLY A HEAVY STORM OF RAIN DESCENDED I HAD BEEN CALM DURING THE DAY BUT SO SOON AS NIGHT OBSCURED THE SHAPES OF OBJECTS
78-368-0004 AND NOT SHRINK FROM THE CONFLICT UNTIL MY OWN LIFE OR THAT OF MY ADVERSARY WAS EXTINGUISHED ELIZABETH OBSERVED MY AGITATION FOR SOME TIME IN TIMID AND FEARFUL SILENCE
78-368-0005 WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD A SHRILL AND DREADFUL SCREAM IT CAME FROM THE ROOM INTO WHICH ELIZABETH HAD RETIRED AS I HEARD IT THE WHOLE TRUTH RUSHED INTO MY MIND MY ARMS DROPPED THE MOTION OF EVERY MUSCLE AND FIBRE WAS SUSPENDED
78-368-0006 I COULD FEEL THE BLOOD TRICKLING IN MY VEINS AND TINGLING IN THE EXTREMITIES OF MY LIMBS THIS STATE LASTED BUT FOR AN INSTANT
78-368-0007 GREAT GOD WHY DID I NOT THEN EXPIRE WHY AM I HERE TO RELATE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE BEST HOPE
78-368-0008 SHE WAS THERE LIFELESS AND INANIMATE THROWN ACROSS THE BED HER HEAD HANGING DOWN AND HER PALE AND DISTORTED FEATURES HALF COVERED BY HER HAIR EVERYWHERE I TURN I SEE THE SAME FIGURE HER BLOODLESS ARMS AND RELAXED FORM
78-368-0009 FLUNG BY THE MURDERER ON ITS BRIDAL BIER COULD I BEHOLD THIS AND LIVE ALAS LIFE IS OBSTINATE AND CLINGS CLOSEST WHERE IT IS MOST HATED
78-368-0010 BUT THE HORROR OF OTHERS APPEARED ONLY AS A MOCKERY A SHADOW OF THE FEELINGS THAT OPPRESSED ME I ESCAPED FROM THEM
78-368-0011 TO THE ROOM WHERE LAY THE BODY OF ELIZABETH MY LOVE MY WIFE SO LATELY LIVING SO DEAR SO WORTHY SHE HAD BEEN MOVED FROM THE POSTURE IN WHICH I HAD FIRST BEHELD HER
78-368-0012 BUT THE DEADLY LANGUOR AND COLDNESS OF THE LIMBS TOLD ME THAT WHAT I NOW HELD IN MY ARMS HAD CEASED TO BE THE ELIZABETH WHOM I HAD LOVED AND CHERISHED THE MURDEROUS MARK OF THE FIEND'S GRASP WAS ON HER NECK
78-368-0013 AND I FELT A KIND OF PANIC ON SEEING THE PALE YELLOW LIGHT OF THE MOON ILLUMINATE THE CHAMBER THE SHUTTERS HAD BEEN THROWN BACK AND WITH A SENSATION OF HORROR NOT TO BE DESCRIBED
78-368-0014 I SAW AT THE OPEN WINDOW A FIGURE THE MOST HIDEOUS AND ABHORRED A GRIN WAS ON THE FACE OF THE MONSTER HE SEEMED TO JEER AS WITH HIS FIENDISH FINGER HE POINTED TOWARDS THE CORPSE OF MY WIFE
78-368-0015 BUT HE ELUDED ME LEAPED FROM HIS STATION AND RUNNING WITH THE SWIFTNESS OF LIGHTNING PLUNGED INTO THE LAKE THE REPORT OF THE PISTOL BROUGHT A CROWD INTO THE ROOM
78-368-0016 NETS WERE CAST BUT IN VAIN AFTER PASSING SEVERAL HOURS WE RETURNED HOPELESS
78-368-0017 AFTER HAVING LANDED THEY PROCEEDED TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY PARTIES GOING IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS AMONG THE WOODS AND VINES I ATTEMPTED TO ACCOMPANY THEM AND PROCEEDED A SHORT DISTANCE FROM THE HOUSE
78-368-0018 A FILM COVERED MY EYES AND MY SKIN WAS PARCHED WITH THE HEAT OF FEVER IN THIS STATE I WAS CARRIED BACK AND PLACED ON A BED HARDLY CONSCIOUS OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED MY EYES WANDERED ROUND THE ROOM
78-368-0019 AS IF TO SEEK SOMETHING THAT I HAD LOST AFTER AN INTERVAL I AROSE AND AS IF BY INSTINCT CRAWLED INTO THE ROOM WHERE THE CORPSE OF MY BELOVED LAY THERE WERE WOMEN WEEPING AROUND I HUNG OVER IT
78-368-0020 AND JOINED MY SAD TEARS TO THEIRS ALL THIS TIME NO DISTINCT IDEA PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY MIND
78-368-0021 SUBJECTS REFLECTING CONFUSEDLY ON MY MISFORTUNES AND THEIR CAUSE I WAS BEWILDERED IN A CLOUD OF WONDER AND HORROR THE DEATH OF WILLIAM THE EXECUTION OF JUSTINE
78-368-0022 THE MURDER OF CLERVAL AND LASTLY OF MY WIFE EVEN AT THAT MOMENT I KNEW NOT THAT MY ONLY REMAINING FRIENDS WERE SAFE FROM THE MALIGNITY OF THE FIEND
78-368-0023 MY FATHER EVEN NOW MIGHT BE WRITHING UNDER HIS GRASP AND ERNEST MIGHT BE DEAD AT HIS FEET THIS IDEA MADE ME SHUDDER AND RECALLED ME TO ACTION
78-368-0024 THERE WERE NO HORSES TO BE PROCURED AND I MUST RETURN BY THE LAKE BUT THE WIND WAS UNFAVOURABLE AND THE RAIN FELL IN TORRENTS
78-368-0025 HOWEVER IT WAS HARDLY MORNING AND I MIGHT REASONABLY HOPE TO ARRIVE BY NIGHT
78-368-0026 BUT NOTHING COULD APPEAR TO ME AS IT HAD DONE THE DAY BEFORE A FIEND HAD SNATCHED FROM ME EVERY HOPE OF FUTURE HAPPINESS NO CREATURE HAD EVER BEEN SO MISERABLE AS I WAS SO FRIGHTFUL AN EVENT IS SINGLE IN THE HISTORY OF MAN
78-368-0027 BUT WHY SHOULD I DWELL UPON THE INCIDENTS THAT FOLLOWED THIS LAST OVERWHELMING EVENT MINE HAS BEEN A TALE OF HORRORS I HAVE REACHED THEIR ACME AND WHAT I MUST NOW RELATE
78-368-0028 KNOW THAT ONE BY ONE MY FRIENDS WERE SNATCHED AWAY I WAS LEFT DESOLATE MY OWN STRENGTH IS EXHAUSTED
78-368-0029 AND I MUST TELL IN A FEW WORDS WHAT REMAINS OF MY HIDEOUS NARRATION I ARRIVED AT GENEVA MY FATHER AND ERNEST YET LIVED BUT THE FORMER SUNK UNDER THE TIDINGS THAT I BORE
78-368-0030 MISERY ON HIS GREY HAIRS AND DOOMED HIM TO WASTE IN WRETCHEDNESS HE COULD NOT LIVE UNDER THE HORRORS THAT WERE ACCUMULATED AROUND HIM THE SPRINGS OF EXISTENCE SUDDENLY GAVE WAY
78-368-0031 SOMETIMES INDEED I DREAMT THAT I WANDERED
78-368-0032 MELANCHOLY FOLLOWED BUT BY DEGREES I GAINED A CLEAR CONCEPTION OF MY MISERIES AND SITUATION AND WAS THEN RELEASED FROM MY PRISON FOR THEY HAD CALLED ME MAD AND DURING MANY MONTHS AS I UNDERSTOOD A SOLITARY CELL HAD BEEN MY HABITATION
78-368-0033 THE MONSTER WHOM I HAD CREATED THE MISERABLE DAEMON WHOM I HAD SENT ABROAD INTO THE WORLD FOR MY DESTRUCTION I WAS POSSESSED BY A MADDENING RAGE WHEN I THOUGHT OF HIM
78-368-0034 AND DESIRED AND ARDENTLY PRAYED THAT I MIGHT HAVE HIM WITHIN MY GRASP TO WREAK A GREAT
78-368-0035 REVENGE ON HIS CURSED HEAD NOR DID MY HATE LONG CONFINE ITSELF TO USELESS WISHES I BEGAN TO REFLECT ON THE BEST MEANS OF SECURING HIM AND FOR THIS PURPOSE
78-368-0036 AND TOLD HIM THAT I HAD AN ACCUSATION TO MAKE THAT I KNEW THE DESTROYER OF MY FAMILY AND THAT I REQUIRED HIM TO EXERT HIS WHOLE AUTHORITY FOR THE APPREHENSION OF THE MURDERER
78-368-0037 HOWEVER WONDERFUL FORCES CONVICTION THE STORY IS TOO CONNECTED TO BE MISTAKEN FOR A DREAM AND I HAVE NO MOTIVE FOR FALSEHOOD
78-368-0038 MY MANNER AS I THUS ADDRESSED HIM WAS IMPRESSIVE
78-368-0039 AND THIS PURPOSE QUIETED MY AGONY AND FOR AN INTERVAL RECONCILED ME TO LIFE I NOW RELATED MY HISTORY BRIEFLY BUT WITH FIRMNESS AND PRECISION MARKING THE DATES WITH ACCURACY
78-368-0040 AND NEVER DEVIATING INTO INVECTIVE OR EXCLAMATION THE MAGISTRATE APPEARED AT FIRST PERFECTLY INCREDULOUS BUT AS I CONTINUED HE BECAME MORE ATTENTIVE AND INTERESTED
78-368-0041 WHEN I HAD CONCLUDED MY NARRATION I SAID THIS IS THE BEING WHOM I ACCUSE AND FOR WHOSE SEIZURE AND PUNISHMENT I CALL UPON YOU TO EXERT YOUR WHOLE POWER
78-368-0042 FROM THE EXECUTION OF THOSE FUNCTIONS ON THIS OCCASION
78-368-0043 I WOULD WILLINGLY AFFORD YOU EVERY AID IN YOUR PURSUIT BUT THE CREATURE OF WHOM YOU SPEAK APPEARS TO HAVE POWERS WHICH WOULD PUT ALL MY EXERTIONS TO DEFIANCE
78-368-0044 WHO CAN FOLLOW AN ANIMAL WHICH CAN TRAVERSE THE SEA OF ICE AND INHABIT CAVES AND DENS WHERE NO MAN WOULD VENTURE TO INTRUDE
78-368-0045 SINCE THE COMMISSION OF HIS CRIMES AND NO ONE CAN CONJECTURE TO WHAT PLACE HE HAS WANDERED OR WHAT REGION HE MAY NOW INHABIT I DO NOT DOUBT THAT HE HOVERS NEAR THE SPOT WHICH I INHABIT
78-368-0046 AND IF HE HAS INDEED TAKEN REFUGE IN THE ALPS HE MAY BE HUNTED LIKE THE CHAMOIS AND DESTROYED AS A BEAST OF PREY BUT I PERCEIVE YOUR THOUGHTS YOU DO NOT CREDIT MY NARRATIVE
78-368-0047 AND DO NOT INTEND TO PURSUE MY ENEMY WITH THE PUNISHMENT WHICH IS HIS DESERT AS I SPOKE RAGE SPARKLED IN MY EYES THE MAGISTRATE WAS INTIMIDATED YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID HE
78-368-0048 I WILL EXERT MYSELF AND IF IT IS IN MY POWER TO SEIZE THE MONSTER BE ASSURED THAT HE SHALL SUFFER PUNISHMENT PROPORTIONATE TO HIS CRIMES BUT I FEAR FROM WHAT YOU
78-368-0049 HAVE YOURSELF DESCRIBED TO BE HIS PROPERTIES THAT THIS WILL PROVE IMPRACTICABLE AND THUS WHILE EVERY PROPER MEASURE IS PURSUED YOU SHOULD MAKE UP YOUR MIND TO DISAPPOINTMENT THAT CANNOT BE
78-368-0050 BUT ALL THAT I CAN SAY WILL BE OF LITTLE AVAIL MY REVENGE IS OF NO MOMENT TO YOU YET WHILE I ALLOW IT TO BE A VICE
78-368-0051 MY RAGE IS UNSPEAKABLE WHEN I REFLECT THAT THE MURDERER WHOM I HAVE TURNED LOOSE UPON SOCIETY STILL EXISTS YOU REFUSE MY JUST DEMAND I HAVE BUT ONE RESOURCE AND I DEVOTE MYSELF EITHER IN MY LIFE OR DEATH TO HIS DESTRUCTION
78-368-0052 I TREMBLED WITH EXCESS OF AGITATION AS I SAID THIS THERE WAS A FRENZY IN MY MANNER AND SOMETHING I DOUBT NOT OF THAT HAUGHTY FIERCENESS WHICH THE MARTYRS OF OLD ARE SAID TO HAVE POSSESSED
78-368-0053 HOW IGNORANT ART THOU IN THY PRIDE OF WISDOM CEASE
78-369-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY FOUR MY PRESENT SITUATION WAS ONE IN WHICH ALL VOLUNTARY THOUGHT WAS SWALLOWED UP AND LOST I WAS HURRIED AWAY BY FURY
78-369-0001 MY FIRST RESOLUTION WAS TO QUIT GENEVA FOREVER MY COUNTRY WHICH WHEN I WAS HAPPY AND BELOVED WAS DEAR TO ME NOW IN MY ADVERSITY BECAME HATEFUL
78-369-0002 I PROVIDED MYSELF WITH A SUM OF MONEY TOGETHER WITH A FEW JEWELS WHICH HAD BELONGED TO MY MOTHER AND DEPARTED AND NOW MY WANDERINGS BEGAN WHICH ARE TO CEASE BUT WITH LIFE
78-369-0003 ALL THE HARDSHIPS WHICH TRAVELLERS IN DESERTS AND BARBAROUS COUNTRIES ARE WONT TO MEET HOW I HAVE LIVED I HARDLY KNOW
78-369-0004 AND PRAYED FOR DEATH BUT REVENGE KEPT ME ALIVE I DARED NOT DIE AND LEAVE MY ADVERSARY IN BEING WHEN I QUITTED GENEVA MY FIRST LABOUR
78-369-0005 UNCERTAIN WHAT PATH I SHOULD PURSUE AS NIGHT APPROACHED I FOUND MYSELF AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE CEMETERY WHERE WILLIAM ELIZABETH AND MY FATHER REPOSED I ENTERED IT
78-369-0006 AND APPROACHED THE TOMB WHICH MARKED THEIR GRAVES EVERYTHING WAS SILENT EXCEPT THE LEAVES OF THE TREES WHICH WERE GENTLY AGITATED BY THE WIND THE NIGHT WAS NEARLY DARK AND THE SCENE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOLEMN
78-369-0007 AND AFFECTING EVEN TO AN UNINTERESTED OBSERVER THE SPIRITS OF THE DEPARTED SEEMED TO FLIT AROUND
78-369-0008 THEIR MURDERER ALSO LIVED AND TO DESTROY HIM I MUST DRAG OUT MY WEARY EXISTENCE I KNELT ON THE GRASS AND KISSED THE EARTH AND WITH QUIVERING LIPS EXCLAIMED BY THE SACRED EARTH
78-369-0009 ON WHICH I KNEEL BY THE SHADES THAT WANDER NEAR ME BY THE DEEP AND ETERNAL GRIEF THAT I FEEL I SWEAR AND BY THEE O NIGHT AND THE SPIRITS THAT PRESIDE OVER THEE TO PURSUE THE DAEMON
78-369-0010 WHICH OTHERWISE SHOULD VANISH FROM MY EYES FOREVER AND I CALL ON YOU SPIRITS OF THE DEAD AND ON YOU WANDERING MINISTERS OF VENGEANCE TO AID AND CONDUCT ME IN MY WORK
78-369-0011 DEEP OF AGONY LET HIM FEEL THE DESPAIR THAT NOW TORMENTS ME I HAD BEGUN MY ADJURATION WITH SOLEMNITY AND AN AWE WHICH ALMOST ASSURED ME THAT THE SHADES OF MY MURDERED FRIENDS
78-369-0012 HEARD AND APPROVED MY DEVOTION BUT THE FURIES POSSESSED ME AS I CONCLUDED AND RAGE CHOKED MY UTTERANCE
78-369-0013 IT RANG ON MY EARS LONG AND HEAVILY THE MOUNTAINS RE ECHOED IT AND I FELT AS IF ALL HELL SURROUNDED ME WITH MOCKERY AND LAUGHTER
78-369-0014 AND THAT I WAS RESERVED FOR VENGEANCE THE LAUGHTER DIED AWAY WHEN A WELL KNOWN AND ABHORRED VOICE APPARENTLY CLOSE TO MY EAR
78-369-0015 I AM SATISFIED MISERABLE WRETCH YOU HAVE DETERMINED TO LIVE AND I AM SATISFIED I DARTED TOWARDS THE SPOT FROM WHICH THE SOUND PROCEEDED BUT THE DEVIL ELUDED MY GRASP
78-369-0016 SUDDENLY THE BROAD DISK OF THE MOON AROSE AND SHONE FULL UPON HIS GHASTLY AND DISTORTED SHAPE AS HE FLED WITH MORE THAN MORTAL SPEED I PURSUED HIM AND FOR MANY MONTHS THIS HAS BEEN MY TASK
78-369-0017 SCARED BY THIS HORRID APPARITION INFORMED ME OF HIS PATH SOMETIMES HE HIMSELF WHO FEARED THAT IF I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM I SHOULD DESPAIR AND DIE LEFT SOME MARK TO GUIDE ME
78-369-0018 THE SNOWS DESCENDED ON MY HEAD AND I SAW THE PRINT OF HIS HUGE STEP ON THE WHITE PLAIN TO YOU FIRST ENTERING ON LIFE TO WHOM CARE IS NEW AND AGONY UNKNOWN
78-369-0019 WOULD SUDDENLY EXTRICATE ME FROM SEEMINGLY INSURMOUNTABLE DIFFICULTIES SOMETIMES WHEN NATURE OVERCOME BY HUNGER SANK UNDER THE EXHAUSTION A REPAST WAS PREPARED FOR ME IN THE DESERT
78-369-0020 THAT RESTORED AND INSPIRITED ME THE FARE WAS INDEED COARSE SUCH AS THE PEASANTS OF THE COUNTRY ATE
78-369-0021 AND VANISH I FOLLOWED WHEN I COULD THE COURSES OF THE RIVERS BUT THE DAEMON GENERALLY AVOIDED THESE AS IT WAS HERE THAT THE POPULATION OF THE COUNTRY CHIEFLY COLLECTED
78-369-0022 I ALWAYS PRESENTED TO THOSE WHO HAD PROVIDED ME WITH FIRE AND UTENSILS FOR COOKING MY LIFE AS IT PASSED THUS WAS INDEED HATEFUL TO ME AND IT WAS DURING SLEEP ALONE THAT I COULD TASTE JOY O BLESSED SLEEP
78-369-0023 OFTEN WHEN MOST MISERABLE I SANK TO REPOSE AND MY DREAMS LULLED ME EVEN TO RAPTURE THE SPIRITS THAT GUARDED ME HAD PROVIDED THESE MOMENTS OR RATHER HOURS OF HAPPINESS THAT I MIGHT RETAIN STRENGTH TO FULFIL MY PILGRIMAGE
78-369-0024 DURING THE DAY I WAS SUSTAINED AND INSPIRITED BY THE HOPE OF NIGHT FOR IN SLEEP I SAW MY FRIENDS MY WIFE AND MY BELOVED COUNTRY AGAIN I SAW THE BENEVOLENT COUNTENANCE OF MY FATHER
78-369-0025 HEARD THE SILVER TONES OF MY ELIZABETH'S VOICE AND BEHELD CLERVAL ENJOYING HEALTH AND YOUTH OFTEN WHEN WEARIED BY A TOILSOME MARCH I PERSUADED MYSELF THAT I WAS DREAMING UNTIL NIGHT SHOULD COME
78-369-0026 AND THAT I SHOULD THEN ENJOY REALITY IN THE ARMS OF MY DEAREST FRIENDS WHAT AGONIZING FONDNESS DID I FEEL FOR THEM
78-369-0027 AND PERSUADE MYSELF THAT THEY STILL LIVED AT SUCH MOMENTS VENGEANCE THAT BURNED WITHIN ME DIED IN MY HEART AND I PURSUED MY PATH TOWARDS THE DESTRUCTION OF THE DAEMON MORE AS A TASK ENJOINED BY HEAVEN
78-369-0028 AS THE MECHANICAL IMPULSE OF SOME POWER OF WHICH I WAS UNCONSCIOUS THAN AS THE ARDENT DESIRE OF MY SOUL WHAT HIS FEELINGS WERE WHOM I PURSUED I CANNOT KNOW
78-369-0029 THESE WORDS WERE LEGIBLE IN ONE OF THESE INSCRIPTIONS YOU LIVE AND MY POWER IS COMPLETE FOLLOW ME I SEEK THE EVERLASTING ICES OF THE NORTH
78-369-0030 WHERE YOU WILL FEEL THE MISERY OF COLD AND FROST TO WHICH I AM IMPASSIVE YOU WILL FIND NEAR THIS PLACE IF YOU FOLLOW NOT TOO TARDILY A DEAD HARE
78-369-0031 AGAIN DO I VOW VENGEANCE AGAIN DO I DEVOTE THEE MISERABLE FIEND TO TORTURE AND DEATH NEVER WILL I GIVE UP MY SEARCH UNTIL HE OR I PERISH AND THEN WITH WHAT ECSTASY
78-369-0032 THE PEASANTS WERE SHUT UP IN THEIR HOVELS AND ONLY A FEW OF THE MOST HARDY VENTURED FORTH TO SEIZE THE ANIMALS WHOM STARVATION HAD FORCED FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES TO SEEK FOR PREY THE RIVERS WERE COVERED WITH ICE
78-369-0033 AND NO FISH COULD BE PROCURED AND THUS I WAS CUT OFF FROM MY CHIEF ARTICLE OF MAINTENANCE THE TRIUMPH OF MY ENEMY INCREASED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MY LABOURS
78-369-0034 ONE INSCRIPTION THAT HE LEFT WAS IN THESE WORDS PREPARE YOUR TOILS ONLY BEGIN WRAP YOURSELF IN FURS AND PROVIDE FOOD FOR WE SHALL SOON ENTER UPON A JOURNEY WHERE YOUR SUFFERINGS
78-369-0035 WILL SATISFY MY EVERLASTING HATRED MY COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE WERE INVIGORATED BY THESE SCOFFING WORDS
78-369-0036 AND CALLING ON HEAVEN TO SUPPORT ME I CONTINUED WITH UNABATED FERVOUR TO TRAVERSE IMMENSE DESERTS UNTIL THE OCEAN APPEARED AT A DISTANCE AND FORMED THE UTMOST BOUNDARY OF THE HORIZON
78-369-0037 OH HOW UNLIKE IT WAS TO THE BLUE SEASONS OF THE SOUTH COVERED WITH ICE IT WAS ONLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FROM LAND BY ITS SUPERIOR WILDNESS AND RUGGEDNESS
78-369-0038 THE GREEKS WEPT FOR JOY WHEN THEY BEHELD THE MEDITERRANEAN FROM THE HILLS OF ASIA AND HAILED WITH RAPTURE THE BOUNDARY OF THEIR TOILS I DID NOT WEEP BUT I KNELT DOWN
78-369-0039 AND WITH A FULL HEART THANKED MY GUIDING SPIRIT FOR CONDUCTING ME IN SAFETY TO THE PLACE WHERE I HOPED NOTWITHSTANDING MY ADVERSARY'S GIBE TO MEET AND GRAPPLE WITH HIM
78-369-0040 SOME WEEKS BEFORE THIS PERIOD I HAD PROCURED A SLEDGE AND DOGS AND THUS TRAVERSED THE SNOWS WITH INCONCEIVABLE SPEED
78-369-0041 AND I HOPED TO INTERCEPT HIM BEFORE HE SHOULD REACH THE BEACH WITH NEW COURAGE THEREFORE I PRESSED ON AND IN TWO DAYS ARRIVED AT A WRETCHED HAMLET ON THE SEASHORE I INQUIRED OF THE INHABITANTS
78-369-0042 CONCERNING THE FIEND AND GAINED ACCURATE INFORMATION A GIGANTIC MONSTER THEY SAID HAD ARRIVED THE NIGHT BEFORE ARMED WITH A GUN AND MANY PISTOLS PUTTING TO FLIGHT THE INHABITANTS OF A SOLITARY COTTAGE
78-369-0043 THROUGH FEAR OF HIS TERRIFIC APPEARANCE HE HAD CARRIED OFF THEIR STORE OF WINTER FOOD AND PLACING IT IN A SLEDGE TO DRAW WHICH HE HAD SEIZED ON A NUMEROUS DROVE OF TRAINED DOGS
78-369-0044 HE HAD HARNESSED THEM AND THE SAME NIGHT TO THE JOY OF THE HORROR STRUCK VILLAGERS HAD PURSUED HIS JOURNEY ACROSS THE SEA IN A DIRECTION THAT LED TO NO LAND AND THEY CONJECTURED
78-369-0045 AMIDST COLD THAT FEW OF THE INHABITANTS COULD LONG ENDURE AND WHICH I THE NATIVE OF A GENIAL AND SUNNY CLIMATE COULD NOT HOPE TO SURVIVE YET AT THE IDEA THAT THE FIEND SHOULD LIVE AND BE TRIUMPHANT
78-369-0046 MY RAGE AND VENGEANCE RETURNED AND LIKE A MIGHTY TIDE OVERWHELMED EVERY OTHER FEELING AFTER A SLIGHT REPOSE DURING WHICH THE SPIRITS OF THE DEAD HOVERED ROUND AND INSTIGATED ME TO TOIL AND REVENGE
78-369-0047 I DEPARTED FROM LAND I CANNOT GUESS HOW MANY DAYS HAVE PASSED SINCE THEN BUT I HAVE ENDURED MISERY WHICH NOTHING BUT THE ETERNAL SENTIMENT
78-369-0048 WHICH THREATENED MY DESTRUCTION BUT AGAIN THE FROST CAME AND MADE THE PATHS OF THE SEA SECURE
78-369-0049 I SHOULD GUESS THAT I HAD PASSED THREE WEEKS IN THIS JOURNEY AND THE CONTINUAL PROTRACTION OF HOPE RETURNING BACK UPON THE HEART OFTEN WRUNG BITTER DROPS OF DESPONDENCY AND GRIEF FROM MY EYES
78-369-0050 DESPAIR HAD INDEED ALMOST SECURED HER PREY AND I SHOULD SOON HAVE SUNK BENEATH THIS MISERY ONCE AFTER THE POOR ANIMALS THAT CONVEYED ME HAD WITH INCREDIBLE TOIL
78-369-0051 GAINED THE SUMMIT OF A SLOPING ICE MOUNTAIN AND ONE SINKING UNDER HIS FATIGUE DIED I VIEWED THE EXPANSE BEFORE ME WITH ANGUISH WHEN SUDDENLY MY EYE CAUGHT A DARK SPECK UPON THE DUSKY PLAIN
78-369-0052 WHAT IT COULD BE AND UTTERED A WILD CRY OF ECSTASY WHEN I DISTINGUISHED A SLEDGE AND THE DISTORTED PROPORTIONS OF A WELL KNOWN FORM WITHIN
78-369-0053 WARM TEARS FILLED MY EYES WHICH I HASTILY WIPED AWAY THAT THEY MIGHT NOT INTERCEPT THE VIEW I HAD OF THE DAEMON BUT STILL MY SIGHT WAS DIMMED BY THE BURNING DROPS UNTIL
78-369-0054 WHEN FOR A SHORT TIME SOME ICE ROCK CONCEALED IT WITH ITS INTERVENING CRAGS I INDEED PERCEPTIBLY GAINED ON IT AND WHEN AFTER NEARLY TWO DAYS JOURNEY
78-369-0055 MY HEART BOUNDED WITHIN ME BUT NOW WHEN I APPEARED ALMOST WITHIN GRASP OF MY FOE MY HOPES WERE SUDDENLY EXTINGUISHED AND I LOST ALL TRACE OF HIM MORE UTTERLY THAN I HAD EVER DONE BEFORE
78-369-0056 AS WITH THE MIGHTY SHOCK OF AN EARTHQUAKE IT SPLIT AND CRACKED WITH A TREMENDOUS AND OVERWHELMING SOUND THE WORK WAS SOON FINISHED IN A FEW MINUTES A TUMULTUOUS SEA ROLLED BETWEEN ME AND MY ENEMY
78-369-0057 AND I WAS LEFT DRIFTING ON A SCATTERED PIECE OF ICE THAT WAS CONTINUALLY LESSENING AND THUS PREPARING FOR ME A HIDEOUS DEATH
78-369-0058 SEVERAL OF MY DOGS DIED AND I MYSELF WAS ABOUT TO SINK UNDER THE ACCUMULATION OF DISTRESS WHEN I SAW YOUR VESSEL RIDING AT ANCHOR
78-369-0059 I HAD NO CONCEPTION THAT VESSELS EVER CAME SO FAR NORTH AND WAS ASTOUNDED AT THE SIGHT I QUICKLY DESTROYED PART OF MY SLEDGE TO CONSTRUCT OARS AND BY THESE MEANS WAS ENABLED WITH INFINITE FATIGUE TO MOVE MY ICE RAFT IN THE DIRECTION OF YOUR SHIP

7800-283478-0010 THE INNOCENT OFTEN HAVE TO SUFFER FOR THE GUILTY SOME OF THE BYSTANDERS AT THIS POINT TRIED TO CONVINCE MISTER CHASE THAT FRANK WAS ENTIRELY INNOCENT OF THE WHOLE TRANSACTION BUT THE MISER ACTING ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN THE BUSH

7800-283478-0012 THE SOONER THAT WINDOW PANE IS REPLACED THE BETTER I SHALL BE PLEASED THAT'S ENOUGH WITH THAT HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON THE GROUP AND HURRIED TO REENTER HIS HOUSE AS THOUGH FEARFUL LEST SOME OF THE SPECTATORS MIGHT ENDEAVOR TO SHAME HIM OUT OF ACCEPTING PAY FROM AN INNOCENT PARTY
7800-283478-0013 FRANK AND HIS THREE COMRADES STOOD TALKING WITH SOME OF THOSE WHO HAD GATHERED WHEN THE CRASH OF BROKEN GLASS FOLLOWED BY ANGRY WORDS IN THE HIGH PITCHED VOICE OF THE MISER DREW ATTENTION TO THE SCENE OF ACTION COME LET'S BE MOVING ALONG FELLOWS BLUFF FINALLY REMARKED
7800-283478-0014 IT GALLED HIM TO THINK THEY HAD BEEN MADE THE SCAPEGOATS BY ANDY LASHER AND HIS SET THOUGH HE KNEW ONLY TOO WELL THAT ONCE FRANK'S MIND WAS MADE UP TO PAY FOR THE BROKEN WINDOW NOTHING COULD CHANGE HIM TRUE TO HIS PROMISE FRANK FIRST OF ALL VISITED THE HARDWARE STORE

7800-283478-0018 ALTHOUGH THE LATTER HAD NOT BEEN A RESIDENT THERE MUCH MORE THAN THREE YEARS
7800-283478-0019 BELIEVE ME I'LL LET YOU BOYS OFF AS LIGHTLY AS I CAN AND NOT LOSE BY IT WAS WHAT HE TOLD THEM

7800-283478-0029 IF WE'RE GOING TO GET IN MANY AFFAIRS LIKE THE ONE WE JUST HAD WITH ANDY LASHER AND HIS CROWD THE LATTER REMARKED IT STANDS TO REASON WE WANT TO TUNE UP SOME IN OUR HEAVING MY BASEBALL ARM IS OUT OF PRACTICE AND I'M ASHAMED TO SAY THAT THREE OUT OF FOUR BALLS I FIRED MISSED THEIR MARK
7800-283478-0030 OH WELL I NOTICED A LOT OF DODGING BEING DONE COMMENTED FRANK AND ONLY FOR THAT ALL OF US MIGHT HAVE MADE MORE BULL'S EYES CHANCES ARE THAT ANDY WILL HAVE A CIRCLE AROUND HIS LEFT EYE AFTER THAT SMASH HE GOT OBSERVED JERRY A HARD SNOWBALL CAN STING LIKE FUN WHEN IT CATCHES YOU THERE

7800-283492-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN DID TEDDY KNOW WELL WOULDN'T THAT JAR YOU REMARKED BLUFF AS HE HEARD WHAT WAS CONTAINED IN THE BRIEF COMMUNICATION FROM THE LUMBERMAN TRIED TO BURN DOWN THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN DID THEY BURST OUT JERRY
7800-283492-0001 WELL IF YOU ASKED ME MY OPINION I'D HAVE TO ADMIT THAT I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF A FEW OF THOSE LUMBERJACKS BUT NOBODY HAS ACCUSED ANY OF THE LOGGERS OF THE CRIME REMARKED FRANK AND AT THAT THE HEAD PROJECTING FROM THE OPENING AT THE DOOR CAME A LITTLE FURTHER INTO VIEW
7800-283492-0002 WHICH WAS PRETTY GOOD EVIDENCE FRANK THOUGHT THAT THE WOUNDED BOY MUST TAKE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THE DISCUSSION WHY WHO ELSE WOULD TRY TO TURN ON MISTER DARREL THAT WAY AND BURN HIS SHANTIES DOWN JUST WHEN WINTER IS SETTING IN ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0003 WE CAN ONLY GIVE A GUESS AT THAT FRANK TOLD HIM WHEW EXCLAIMED BLUFF AS HE GRASPED THE MEANING BACK OF THOSE FEW WORDS AFTER ALL I WOULDN'T PUT IT PAST HIM FRANK
7800-283492-0004 AND NOT ABLE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT ALL THESE STRANGE HINTS PORTENDED WE HAD A SPECIMEN OF HIS NASTY TEMPER YOU KNOW CONTINUED BLUFF YES TWICE NOW WE'VE HEARD HIM TEAR AROUND LIKE A BULL IN A CHINA SHOP
7800-283492-0005 OH NOW I TUMBLE TO WHAT YOU MEAN CRIED WILL WHO DID NOT OFTEN USE ANY SORT OF SLANG AND MUST THEREFORE HAVE BEEN UNUSUALLY EXCITED TO FALL INTO THE HABIT IT'S BILL BILL NACKERSON FRANK NODDED HIS HEAD
7800-283492-0006 HE'S THE ONLY PARTY AROUND THAT WE KNOW OF WHO WOULD BE MEAN ENOUGH TO TRY TO SET BUILDINGS ON FIRE JUST TO GET EVEN WITH A MAN HE DISLIKED HE OBSERVED
7800-283492-0007 YES AND DIDN'T WE HEAR HIM THREATEN TO DO SOMETHING BEFORE LONG SO AS TO HIT BACK AT MISTER DARREL JERRY WANTED TO KNOW AS IF HE HAD ALL ALONG BEEN SUSPICIOUS OF THE BIG SPORTSMAN
7800-283492-0008 WHY HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE DEATH OF SOME OF THEM WHOEVER STARTED THE FIRE DIDN'T CARE A HOOT WHETHER IT HURT OR NOT I THINK BLUFF GAVE AS HIS OPINION FRANK NOTICED THAT THE HEAD HAD DISAPPEARED FROM ALONGSIDE THE OPEN DOOR
7800-283492-0009 EVIDENTLY TEDDY HAD HEARD ENOUGH HE MUST HAVE LIMPED FROM HIS CHAIR TO THE DOORWAY UPON HEARING STRANGE VOICES OUTSIDE PERHAPS HE HAD SUSPECTED THAT THE OTHERS BROUGHT NEWS OF SOME STARTLING CHARACTER FRANK DID NOT TELL ALL OF HIS CHUMS ABOUT WHAT HE HAD SEEN
7800-283492-0010 AT THE SAME TIME IT GAVE HIM FOOD FOR MUCH SERIOUS THOUGHT I WOULDN'T BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF TEDDY KNEW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT FIRE BUSINESS HE MENTIONED TO BLUFF A SHORT TIME LATER WHEN THEY WALKED TOGETHER DOWN TO THE SPOT WHERE THE MINK TRACKS HAD BEEN SEEN
7800-283492-0011 I SAW HIS HEAD THOUGH AFTER A BIT WHEN WE HAD TALKED MATTERS OVER HE WENT BACK TO THE FIRE AGAIN
7800-283492-0012 OH NO IT ISN'T SO BAD AS THAT HE WAS ASSURED
7800-283492-0013 THE BIG COWARD MUTTERED BLUFF CLENCHING HIS FISTS AND SHAKING HIS HEAD AS THOUGH HE WOULD LIKE NOTHING BETTER THAN TO GET IN A BLOW AT THE BULLY MY OPINION AS FAR AS I HAVE ANY IS ABOUT LIKE THIS FRANK CONTINUED
7800-283492-0014 AFTER NACKERSON STRUCK TEDDY THE BOY HAPPENED TO OVERHEAR HIM BOASTING ABOUT WHAT HE MEANT TO DO TO THE CAMP AT LUMBER RUN OH I SEE NOW WHAT YOU MEAN FRANK
7800-283492-0015 YOU'VE GOT IT ABOUT STRAIGHT BLUFF FRANK ADMITTED OF COURSE I'M ONLY GUESSING ALL THIS REMEMBER
7800-283492-0016 HE'LL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S NO REASON WHY HE SHOULD KEEP A STILL TONGUE IN HIS HEAD TO SHIELD A RASCAL WHO DIDN'T HESITATE TO STRIKE HIM A COWARDLY BLOW BLUFF WAS NOT SLOW OF COMPREHENSION
7800-283492-0017 JUST AS YOU SAY TEDDY COULDN'T HAVE BEEN THE ONE TO PUT THE MATCH TO THE CAMP OVER AT LUMBER RUN WHEN NACKERSON HAD GONE AWAY PERHAPS WITH ONE OF HIS PALS WHO AGREED TO STAND BACK OF HIM THAT'S THE TIME TEDDY LIT OUT
7800-283492-0018 HE STRUCK IT PRETTY HARD AT FIRST GETTING CAUGHT IN THAT TRAP FRANK MUSED BUT WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO FACTS I GUESS IT WAS JUST AS WELL THAT IT HAPPENED TO HIM HUH THAT'S A QUEER THING TO SAY REMONSTRATED BLUFF
7800-283492-0019 BLUFF ADMITTED AS TEDDY DIDN'T KNOW WHERE WE HUNG OUT AND COULDN'T FIND HIS WAY TO LUMBER RUN CAMP YOU CAN SEE THAT HE WOULD HAVE HAD TO CHOOSE BETWEEN GOING BACK TO NACKERSON OR LOSING HIMSELF IN THE BIG WOODS
7800-283492-0020 WHEW IT DOES TAKE YOU TO SEE THROUGH THINGS BLUFF DECLARED WITH A LAUGH I CAN UNDERSTAND NOW THAT IT WAS A BIG STREAK OF LUCK FOR TED WHEN HE MET WITH THAT BEAR TRAP WE NEVER KNOW WHEN WE'RE WELL OFF DO WE
7800-283492-0021 FRANK WAS ALWAYS ACCOMMODATING ESPECIALLY WHEN ANYTHING CONNECTED WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE OF NATURE WAS CONCERNED HE LOVED TO WATCH THE SMALL WOODS FOLK WHEN THEY DID NOT SUSPECT HIS PRESENCE AND LEARN MORE AND MORE OF THEIR INTERESTING HABITS
7800-283492-0022 SO THAT DAY PASSED ANOTHER AND YET A THIRD FOUND THE BOYS ENJOYING THEMSELVES TO THE LIMIT TEDDY WAS SHOWING DECIDED SIGNS OF IMPROVEMENT HE COULD GET AROUND FAIRLY WELL BY NOW JERRY HAVING CUT HIM A WALKING STICK WITH A CROOK AT THE END
7800-283492-0023 HE WAS BEGINNING TO GET OVER THE NERVOUSNESS THAT HAD SHOWN ITSELF FOR A WHOLE DAY FOLLOWING HIS ADVENT IN THE NEW CAMP
7800-283492-0024 TO GO BACK TO THAT OTHER DRUDGERY WOULD HAVE BEEN TORTURE AS SOON AS HE WAS ABLE TO GET AROUND HE INSISTED ON TAKING CHARGE OF THE COOKING AND THE BOYS SOON LEARNED THAT TEDDY COULD MANAGE SPLENDIDLY
7800-283492-0025 HE HAD TO BE SHOWN VERY LITTLE SO AS TO SUIT THEIR TASTES AND NONE OF THEM REGRETTED IN THE LEAST THAT THEY HAD EXTENDED A HELPING HAND TOWARD ONE IN DISTRESS A NEW LIFE WAS OPENING UP TO TEDDY
7800-283492-0026 HE HAD NEVER BEFORE COME IN CONTACT WITH SUCH AN AGREEABLE LOT OF COMPANIONS AND EVERY HOUR OF THE DAY HE TRIED TO PROVE HIMSELF GRATEFUL STILL HE DID NOT MENTION A WORD ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT POSSIBLY KNOW OF THE DASTARDLY DEED
7800-283492-0027 WHEN SOME ONE ATTEMPTED TO FIRE THE LOGGING CAMP FRANK OFTEN SAW A WORRIED EXPRESSION COME OVER THE BOY'S FACE AND AT SUCH TIMES HE SUSPECTED THAT TEDDY WAS PUZZLING HIS BRAIN AS TO JUST WHAT HIS DUTY MIGHT BE
7800-283492-0028 AND IF HE DOES IT WILL NOT BE THE REWARD OF A HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR INFORMATION THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL ON THE SECOND DAY ABOUT NOON SOME OF THE BOYS WERE BUSY NEAR THE CABIN LAYING IN AN EXTRA SUPPLY OF FIREWOOD
7800-283492-0029 FRANK HAD AN IDEA THEY WOULD BE VISITED BY A BIG SNOWFALL BEFORE TWENTY FOUR HOURS HAD PASSED OF COURSE THAT'S ONLY A HAZARD FELLOWS HE TOLD BLUFF AND JERRY WHO WERE HELPING HIM ADD TO THE HANDY HEAP CLOSE TO THE DOOR OF THE CABIN
7800-283492-0030 BUT THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A FEELING OF DAMPNESS IN THE AIR FOR ALL IT'S SO COLD AND THE SUN YOU NOTICE SHINES THROUGH A SORT OF HAZY CURTAIN I THINK JUST THE SAME WAY YOU DO FRANK JERRY REMARKED AND IF YOU ASKED ME TO SAY WHEN
7800-283492-0031 I'D GUESS IT WAS GOING TO STRIKE US BEFORE NIGHT WE'VE GOT OFF PRETTY FORTUNATELY SO FAR ABOUT STORMS BLUFF WENT ON AS HE THREW ANOTHER ARMFUL OF FUEL ON THE ALREADY HUGE PILE
7800-283492-0032 AND TO THINK IT HAPPENED SO NEAR OUR CAMP THAT WE MANAGED TO TOTE THE WHOLE CARCASS TO THE CABIN AND BLUFF LOOKED WITH PRIDE IN HIS EYES TOWARD A DEER THAT WAS HANGING IN REAL SPORTSMAN STYLE FROM A LIMB HEAD DOWNWARD
7800-283492-0033 IF WE DON'T GET ANOTHER WHILE WE'RE UP HERE IN THE BIG WOODS SAID JERRY SUPPRESSING THE NATURAL TWINGE OF JEALOUSY HE FELT WE OUGHT TO BE SATISFIED WITH OUR BAG AND WILL IS JUST WILD OVER THE BULLY PICTURES HE'S ACCUMULATING EVERY DAY AND NIGHT
7800-283492-0034 IT DOES SEEM AS THOUGH HE HAD MET WITH NOTHING BUT SUCCESS SO FAR FRANK ADMITTED I HOPE HE GETS THAT PRIZE THE RAILROADS ARE OFFERING SO FAR AS I CAN TELL HE HAS A DANDY COLLECTION ALREADY AND WE'VE GOT SOME TIME AHEAD OF US STILL BY THE WAY WHERE IS WILL NOW ASKED BLUFF
7800-283492-0035 ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO HE TOLD ME HE WAS GOING OFF TO THE PLACE WHERE WE DISCOVERED THAT COMICAL COLONY OF SQUIRRELS THAT AMUSED US YESTERDAY FRANK EXPLAINED HE HOPED BY KEEPING AS STILL AS A MOUSE TO GET A SNAP AT THEM WHEN THEY WERE CARRYING ON THAT WAY
7800-283492-0036 I THINK MYSELF IT WOULD BE A FINE WOODS PICTURE AND ADD TO HIS COLLECTION SPEAKING OF ANGELS AND YOU'RE MOST SURE TO HEAR THEIR WINGS CHUCKLED JERRY FOR THERE'S WILL COMING THIS WAY NOW AND ON THE RUN TOO ADDED FRANK
7800-283492-0037 HE LOOKS EXCITED FELLOWS I WONDER WHAT HE'S RUN ACROSS NOW WILL WAS ALMOST OUT OF BREATH THEY COULD SEE THAT HIS FACE WAS RED FROM HIS EXERTIONS BUT FILLED WITH EXCITEMENT AS WELL WHILE HIS EYES WERE AS BLUFF EXPRESSED IT
7800-283492-0038 STICKING OUT OF HIS HEAD OH WHAT A WHOPPER HE GASPED AS HE DREW NEAR THE SPOT WHERE THEY STOOD WHAT'S THAT DEMANDED FRANK WONDERING WHAT WAS COMING NOW AND SUCH TRE MENDOUS HORNS TOO CONTINUED WILL
7800-283492-0039 INVOLUNTARILY STRETCHING OUT BOTH HANDS UNTIL HE HAD THEM WIDE APART HORNS WILL BLUFF FIRED AT HIM COWS HAVE HORNS DEER CARRY ANTLERS I SAID HORNS DIDN'T I ASSERTED THE OTHER WITH DETERMINATION
7800-283492-0040 BUT I SNAPPED HIM BEFORE HE TURNED AND TROTTED OFF WHAT TROTTED OFF SHRILLED BLUFF
7800-283493-0000 THE BIG MOOSE A BULL MOOSE YOU SAY WILL ECHOED BLUFF HIS FACE LIGHTING UP WITH SUDDEN ENERGY THAT'S WHAT I MEAN REPLIED THE OTHER I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING BLUFF AND THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW A BULL MOOSE IF I SAW ONE
7800-283493-0001 BUT YOU'RE AWAY OFF IN YOUR GUESS I'VE SO LONGED TO MEET UP WITH ONE WHEN I HAD MY CAMERA WITH ME THAT I'VE BEEN PICTURING HOW HE'D LOOK AND FRANK BELIEVE ME IT WAS A BEAUT A REGULAR MONSTER HOW DID IT HAPPEN WILL ASKED FRANK
7800-283493-0002 I WAS SITTING AS STILL AS ANYTHING THE OTHER RELATED AFTER I'D GOT TWO DANDY SNAPS AT THAT FUNNY SQUIRREL FAMILY PLAYING AROUND THE TREE WHERE THEY HAVE THEIR HOME AND WAS HOPING FOR ANOTHER WHACK AT THEM TO COMPLETE THE SET WHEN ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A WHIFFING SOUND
7800-283493-0003 BUT GO ON WILL WHAT HAPPENED NEXT OH I LOOKED UP TO SEE WHAT HAD MADE THAT QUEER SOUND AND THERE HE WAS JUST STANDING AND LOOKING STRAIGHT AT ME I WAS NEARLY SCARED TO DEATH AT FIRST FOR HE LOOKED NEARLY AS BIG AS A BARN
7800-283493-0004 THEN I KNEW IT MUST BE A BULL MOOSE AND THE NEXT THING I FOUND MYSELF TAKING HIS PICTURE DID HE RUN AWAY THEN ASKED FRANK TURNED AND TROTTED OFF AS IF HE DIDN'T CARE WHETHER SCHOOL KEPT OR NOT WILL CONTINUED I EVEN HAD THE NERVE TO SHOOT HIM AGAIN AS HE WAS GOING
7800-283493-0005 AND DON'T I HOPE THAT FIRST PICTURE TURNS OUT GOOD IT WAS A REMARKABLE POSE IF ONLY THE FOCUS WAS RIGHT HE STARTED TOWARD THE CABIN DOOR AS THOUGH ANXIOUS TO DEVELOP HIS ROLL OF FILM AND DISCOVER WHAT SUCCESS HIS LABOR HAD RESULTED IN
7800-283493-0006 BLUFF CAUGHT HIM BY THE ARM WAIT JUST A MINUTE OR TWO WILL HE PLEADED TELL US SOME MORE WHERE DID ALL THIS HAPPEN FRANK KNOWS WHERE THAT SQUIRREL COLONY HAVE THEIR NEST IN THE TREE THAT'S GOT A HOLE IN THE TRUNK ABOUT THIRTY FEET UP THE OTHER REPLIED
7800-283493-0007 THAT NEAR THE CAMP IF ONLY YOU'LL HOLD YOUR HORSES UNTIL I CAN DEVELOP THIS FILM YOU SHALL SEE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER I KNOW A STAG FROM A BULL MOOSE HE WAS TOLD BY THE INDIGNANT PHOTOGRAPHER AS THE LATTER BROKE AWAY AND VANISHED INSIDE THE CABIN
7800-283493-0008 HE DID NOT FEEL THAT THEY COULD ENTIRELY DEPEND ON THE EVIDENCE OF WILL WHO MAY HAVE BEEN SO STARTLED BY THE SUDDEN COMING OF SOME ANIMAL THAT HIS IMAGINATION WORKED OVERTIME I HOPE IT WASN'T JUST A MULE THAT STRAYED AWAY FROM SOME LUMBER CAMP HE TOLD THE OTHERS
7800-283493-0009 AS THEY HURRIED OFF BUT NOT BEFORE BLUFF AND JERRY HAD DARTED INSIDE THE CABIN AND REAPPEARED CARRYING THEIR GUNS
7800-283493-0010 BLUFF ADMITTED BUT THEN WILL VOWS IT HAD HORNS TERRIBLY BIG HORNS WHICH NO MULE I EVER SAW COULD BOAST OF OWNING WELL CHANCES ARE IT WAS A BULL MOOSE FRANK ADMITTED BUT WE'LL SOON KNOW

7800-283493-0016 WHY COULDN'T I HAVE TAKEN A NOTION TO STEP OUT HERE WITH WILL TO WATCH THE WAY HE TOOK THE PICTURES OF THAT SQUIRREL FAMILY I'D HAVE HAD MY GUN ACROSS MY KNEES WITH BUCKSHOT IN EVERY SHELL OF COURSE THINK HOW

7800-283493-0020 FOR UP TO NOW HE HAD NOT BEEN GIVEN MUCH OF A CHANCE TO BRING DOWN ANY BIG GAME ON THIS TRIP AND WAS SECRETLY CHAFING
7800-283493-0021 THE SOONER THE BETTER SO AS TO KEEP HIS LEAD CUT DOWN AS MUCH AS WE CAN HE WAS TOLD BY BLUFF AFTER WHICH THEY BOTH TURNED TOWARD FRANK FOR AFTER ALL IT WOULD BE FROM THIS QUARTER THAT THE SIGNAL TO START MUST EVENTUALLY COME
7800-283493-0022 NO NEED OF RUSHING OFF AS THOUGH YOU WERE CRAZY FRANK TOLD THEM WILL SAYS THE MOOSE DIDN'T ACT AS THOUGH IT WAS BADLY FRIGHTENED BY SEEING HIM

7859-102518-0000 THE ROMAN AND THE PERSIAN EMPIRES DRAINED OF MEN AND MONEY AND RAVAGED FROM END TO END BY EACH OTHER'S MARAUDING ARMIES SANK DOWN IN EXHAUSTION TO HEAL THEM OF THEIR DEADLY WOUNDS
7859-102518-0001 NEVER BEFORE HAD EITHER POWER DEALT ITS NEIGHBOUR SUCH FEARFUL BLOWS AS IN THIS LAST STRUGGLE IN PREVIOUS WARS THE CONTEST HAD BEEN WAGED AROUND BORDER FORTRESSES AND THE PRIZE HAD BEEN THE CONQUEST OF SOME SMALL SLICE OF MARCHLAND
7859-102518-0002 HAD STRUCK DEADLY BLOWS AT THE HEART OF EACH OTHER'S EMPIRE AND HARRIED THE INMOST PROVINCES UP TO THE GATES OF EACH OTHER'S CAPITALS THE PERSIAN HAD TURNED THE WILD HORDES OF THE AVARS LOOSE ON THRACE
7859-102518-0003 THEY WERE BLEEDING AT EVERY PORE UTTERLY WEARIED AND EXHAUSTED AND DESIROUS OF NOTHING BUT A LONG INTERVAL OF PEACE TO RECOVER THEIR LOST STRENGTH PRECISELY AT THIS MOMENT A NEW AND TERRIBLE ENEMY FELL UPON THE TWO WAR WORN COMBATANTS
7859-102518-0004 AND DELIVERED AN ATTACK SO VEHEMENT THAT IT WAS DESTINED TO DESTROY THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF PERSIA AND TO SHEAR AWAY HALF THE PROVINCES OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE
7859-102518-0005 THE POLITICS OF ARABIA HAD UP TO THIS TIME BEEN OF LITTLE MOMENT EITHER TO ROMAN OR PERSIAN EACH OF THEM HAD ALLIES AMONG THE ARAB TRIBES AND HAD SOMETIMES SENT AN EXPEDITION OR AN EMBASSY SOUTHWARD
7859-102518-0006 INTO THE LAND BEYOND THE SYRIAN DESERT BUT NEITHER OF THEM DREAMED THAT THE SCATTERED AND DISUNITED TRIBES OF ARABIA WOULD EVER COMBINE OR BECOME A SERIOUS DANGER
7859-102518-0007 EVENTS OF WORLD WIDE IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN TAKING PLACE IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA FOR THE FIRST AND LAST TIME IN HISTORY THERE HAD ARISEN AMONG THE ARABS ONE OF THOSE WORLD COMPELLING MINDS THAT ARE DESTINED TO TURN ASIDE THE CURRENT OF EVENTS
7859-102518-0008 INTO NEW CHANNELS AND CHANGE THE FACE OF WHOLE CONTINENTS MAHOMET THAT STRANGEST OF MORAL ENIGMAS PROPHET AND SEER FANATIC AND IMPOSTOR WAS DEVELOPING HIS CAREER ALL THROUGH THE YEARS OF THE PERSIAN WAR
7859-102518-0009 BY AN EXTRAORDINARY MIXTURE OF GENUINE ENTHUSIASM AND VULGAR CUNNING OF SELF DECEPTION AND DELIBERATE IMPOSTURE OF BENEVOLENCE AND CRUELTY OF AUSTERITY AND LICENCE HE HAD WORKED HIMSELF AND HIS CREED TO THE FRONT
7859-102518-0010 THE TURBULENT POLYTHEISTS OF ARABIA HAD BY HIM BEEN CONVERTED INTO A COMPACT BAND OF FANATICS BURNING TO CARRY ALL OVER THE WORLD BY THE FORCE OF THEIR SWORDS THEIR NEW WAR CRY THAT
7859-102518-0011 GOD WAS GOD AND MAHOMET HIS PROPHET
7859-102518-0012 BIDDING THEM EMBRACE ISLAM THE PERSIAN REPLIED WITH THE THREAT THAT HE WOULD PUT THE PROPHET IN CHAINS WHEN HE HAD LEISURE THE ROMAN MADE NO DIRECT REPLY BUT SENT MAHOMET SOME SMALL PRESENTS
7859-102518-0013 NEGLECTING THE THEOLOGICAL BENT OF HIS MESSAGE AND ONLY THINKING OF ENLISTING A POSSIBLE POLITICAL ALLY BOTH ANSWERS WERE REGARDED AS EQUALLY UNSATISFACTORY BY THE PROPHET AND HE DOOMED THE TWO EMPIRES TO A SIMILAR DESTRUCTION
7859-102518-0014 IS NOT A THING TO BE DESPISED
7859-102518-0015 NOR SCOFF WITH GIBBON AT THE FEEBLENESS OF THE TROOPS WHO WERE ROUTED BY THEM IF THE SOLDIERS OF QUEEN VICTORIA ARMED WITH MODERN RIFLES AND ARTILLERY FOUND THE FANATICAL ARAB A FORMIDABLE FOE LET US NOT BLAME THE SOLDIERS OF HERACLIUS WHO FACED THE SAME ENEMY
7859-102518-0016 IN THE EARLY ENGAGEMENTS BETWEEN THE EAST ROMANS AND THE SARACENS THE SUPERIOR DISCIPLINE AND MORE REGULAR ARMS OF THE ONE
7859-102518-0017 WERE NOT A SUFFICIENT COUNTERPOISE TO PUT AGAINST THE MAD RECKLESSNESS OF THE OTHER THE MOSLEM WANTED TO GET KILLED THAT HE MIGHT REAP THE FRUITS OF MARTYRDOM IN THE OTHER WORLD AND CARED NOT HOW HE DIED IF HE HAD FIRST SLAIN AN ENEMY
7859-102518-0018 THE ROMAN FOUGHT WELL ENOUGH BUT HE DID NOT LIKE HIS ADVERSARY YEARN TO BECOME A MARTYR AND THE ODDS WERE ON THE MAN WHO HELD HIS LIFE THE CHEAPEST
7859-102518-0019 AND TO DO SO HAD NOT ONLY DRAINED THE TREASURY BUT IMPOSED SOME NEW AND UNWISE TAXES ON THE HARASSED PROVINCIALS AND DISBANDED MANY OF HIS VETERANS FOR THE SAKE OF ECONOMY
7859-102518-0020 SYRIA AND EGYPT AFTER SPENDING TWELVE AND TEN YEARS RESPECTIVELY UNDER THE PERSIAN YOKE HAD NOT YET GOT BACK INTO THEIR OLD ORGANIZATION
7859-102518-0021 BOTH COUNTRIES WERE MUCH DISTRACTED WITH RELIGIOUS TROUBLES THE HERETICAL SECTS OF THE MONOPHYSITES AND JACOBITES WHO SWARMED WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES HAD LIFTED UP THEIR HEADS UNDER THE PERSIAN RULE BEING RELIEVED FROM THE GOVERNMENTAL REPRESSION THAT HAD HITHERTO BEEN THEIR LOT
7859-102518-0022 THEY SEEM TO HAVE CONSTITUTED AN ACTUAL MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION AND BITTERLY RESENTED THE ENDEAVOURS OF HERACLIUS TO ENFORCE ORTHODOXY IN THE RECONQUERED PROVINCES THEIR DISCONTENT WAS SO BITTER
7859-102518-0023 THE DETAILS OF THE ARAB CONQUEST OF SYRIA HAVE NOT BEEN PRESERVED BY THE EAST ROMAN HISTORIANS WHO SEEM TO HAVE HATED THE IDEA OF RECORDING THE DISASTERS OF CHRISTENDOM THE MOSLEMS ON THE OTHER HAND HAD NOT YET COMMENCED TO WRITE AND ERE HISTORIANS AROSE AMONG THEM
7859-102518-0024 THE TALE OF THE INVASION HAD BEEN INTERTWINED WITH A WHOLE CYCLE OF ROMANTIC LEGENDS FITTER FOR THE ARABIAN NIGHTS
7859-102518-0025 GABATHA IN ITURAEA THOROUGHLY ROUSED BY THIS DISASTER HERACLIUS SET ALL THE LEGIONS OF THE EAST MARCHING AND SIXTY THOUSAND MEN CROSSED THE JORDAN AND ADVANCED TO RECOVER BOSTRA
7859-102518-0026 THE ARABS MET THEM AT THE FORDS OF THE HIEROMAX AN EASTERN TRIBUTARY OF THE JORDAN AND A FIERCE BATTLE RAGED ALL DAY THE ROMANS DROVE THE ENEMY BACK TO THE VERY GATES OF THEIR CAMP BUT A LAST CHARGE HEADED BY THE FIERCE WARRIOR KHALED
7859-102518-0027 BROKE THEIR FIRM ARRAY WHEN A VICTORY SEEMED ALMOST ASSURED ALL THE MAILED HORSEMEN OF HERACLIUS
7859-102518-0028 PARADISE IS BEFORE YOU THE DEVIL AND HELL FIRE BEHIND THE FANATICAL ORIENTALS THREW THEMSELVES ON REGIMENT AFTER REGIMENT AND DROVE IT OFF THE FIELD ALL SYRIA EAST OF JORDAN WAS LOST IN THIS FATAL BATTLE DAMASCUS ITS GREAT STRONGHOLD
7859-102518-0029 MOST OF ITS POPULATION WERE MASSACRED
7859-102518-0030 AND WAS BEGINNING TO FAIL IN HEALTH HE COULD DO NOTHING EMESA AND HELIOPOLIS WERE SACKED BEFORE HIS EYES AND AFTER AN INGLORIOUS CAMPAIGN HE HURRIED TO JERUSALEM
7859-102518-0031 TOOK THE TRUE CROSS FROM ITS SANCTUARY WHERE HE HAD REPLACED IT IN TRIUMPH FIVE YEARS BEFORE AND RETIRED TO CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102518-0032 HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN THE NEWS ARRIVED THAT HIS DISCONTENTED AND DEMORALIZED TROOPS HAD PROCLAIMED A REBEL EMPEROR THOUGH THE ENEMY WAS BEFORE THEM
7859-102518-0033 AND THE AGED OMAR CAME OVER THE DESERT PROUD TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE CITY WHICH MAHOMET HAD RECKONED THE HOLIEST SITE ON EARTH SAVE MECCA ALONE THE PATRIARCH SOPHRONIUS WAS COMMANDED TO GUIDE THE CONQUEROR AROUND THE CITY
7859-102518-0034 AND WHEN HE SAW THE RUDE ARAB STANDING BY THE ALTAR OF THE CHURCH OF THE HOLY SEPULCHRE CRIED ALOUD NOW IS THE ABOMINATION OF DESOLATION WHICH WAS SPOKEN OF BY DANIEL THE PROPHET TRULY IN THE HOLY PLACE
7859-102519-0000 WAS A SOVEREIGN OF A DIFFERENT TYPE FROM ANY EMPEROR THAT WE HAVE YET ENCOUNTERED IN THE ANNALS OF THE EASTERN EMPIRE HE WAS A BOLD RECKLESS CALLOUS AND SELFISH YOUNG MAN
7859-102519-0001 HE WAS IN SHORT OF THE STUFF OF WHICH TYRANTS ARE MADE JUSTINIAN WAS BUT SEVENTEEN WHEN HE CAME TO THE THRONE BUT HE SOON SHOWED THAT HE INTENDED TO RULE THE EMPIRE AFTER HIS OWN GOOD PLEASURE
7859-102519-0002 LONG BEFORE HE HAD BEGUN TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF STATE CRAFT ERE HE HAD REACHED HIS TWENTY FIRST YEAR JUSTINIAN HAD PLUNGED INTO WAR WITH THE BULGARIANS HE ATTACKED THEM SUDDENLY INFLICTED SEVERAL DEFEATS ON THEIR KING
7859-102519-0003 AND TOOK NO LESS THAN THIRTY THOUSAND PRISONERS WHOM HE SENT OVER TO ASIA AND FORCED TO ENLIST IN THE ARMY OF ARMENIA
7859-102519-0004 BEARING VERSES OF THE KORAN JUSTINIAN REFUSED TO RECEIVE THEM AND DECLARED WAR HIS SECOND VENTURE IN THE FIELD WAS DISASTROUS HIS UNWILLING RECRUITS FROM BULGARIA DESERTED TO THE ENEMY WHEN HE MET THE SARACENS AT SEBASTOPOLIS
7859-102519-0005 AND THE ROMAN ARMY WAS ROUTED WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER THE TWO SUBSEQUENT CAMPAIGNS WERE EQUALLY UNSUCCESSFUL
7859-102519-0006 JUSTINIAN'S WARS DEPLETED HIS TREASURY YET HE PERSISTED IN PLUNGING INTO EXPENSIVE SCHEMES OF BUILDING AT THE SAME TIME AND WAS DRIVEN TO COLLECT MONEY BY THE MOST RECKLESS EXTORTION HE EMPLOYED TWO UNSCRUPULOUS MINISTERS THEODOTUS
7859-102519-0007 THE ACCOUNTANT GENERAL AN EX ABBOT WHO HAD DESERTED HIS MONASTERY AND THE EUNUCH STEPHANUS THE KEEPER OF THE PRIVY PURSE THESE MEN WERE TO JUSTINIAN WHAT RALPH FLAMBARD WAS TO WILLIAM RUFUS
7859-102519-0008 THEY RAISED HIM FUNDS BY FLAGRANT EXTORTION AND ILLEGAL STRETCHING OF THE LAW BOTH WERE VIOLENT AND CRUEL THEODOTUS IS SAID TO HAVE HUNG RECALCITRANT TAX PAYERS UP BY ROPES ABOVE SMOKY FIRES TILL THEY WERE NEARLY STIFLED
7859-102519-0009 STEPHANUS THRASHED AND STONED EVERY ONE WHO FELL INTO HIS HANDS HE IS REPORTED TO HAVE ACTUALLY ADMINISTERED A WHIPPING TO THE EMPRESS DOWAGER DURING THE ABSENCE OF HER SON AND JUSTINIAN DID NOT PUNISH HIM WHEN HE RETURNED
7859-102519-0010 WHILE THE EMPEROR'S FINANCIAL EXPEDIENTS WERE MAKING HIM HATED BY THE MONEYED CLASSES HE WAS RENDERING HIMSELF NO LESS UNPOPULAR IN THE ARMY
7859-102519-0011 HE BEGAN TO EXECUTE OR IMPRISON HIS OFFICERS AND TO DECIMATE HIS BEATEN TROOPS TO BE EMPLOYED BY HIM IN HIGH COMMAND WAS ALMOST AS DANGEROUS AS IT WAS TO BE APPOINTED A GENERAL IN CHIEF DURING THE DICTATORSHIP OF ROBESPIERRE
7859-102519-0012 GENERAL OF THE THEME OF HELLAS WAS ABOUT TO SET OUT TO ASSUME HIS COMMAND AS HE PARTED FROM HIS FRIENDS HE EXCLAIMED THAT HIS DAYS WERE NUMBERED AND THAT HE SHOULD BE EXPECTING THE ORDER FOR HIS EXECUTION TO ARRIVE AT ANY MOMENT THEN A CERTAIN MONK NAMED PAUL STOOD FORTH
7859-102519-0013 AND BADE HIM SAVE HIMSELF BY A BOLD STROKE IF HE WOULD AIM A BLOW AT JUSTINIAN HE WOULD FIND THE PEOPLE AND THE ARMY READY TO FOLLOW HIM
7859-102519-0014 AND RUSHING TO THE STATE PRISON AT THE HEAD OF A FEW FRIENDS BROKE IT OPEN AND LIBERATED SOME HUNDREDS OF POLITICAL PRISONERS A MOB JOINED HIM HE SEIZED THE CATHEDRAL OF SAINT SOPHIA
7859-102519-0015 NO ONE WOULD FIGHT FOR JUSTINIAN WHO WAS CAUGHT AND BROUGHT BEFORE THE REBEL LEADER IN COMPANY WITH HIS TWO ODIOUS MINISTERS
7859-102519-0016 AND BANISHED HIM TO CHERSON THEODOTUS AND STEPHANUS HE HANDED OVER TO THE MOB WHO DRAGGED THEM ROUND THE CITY AND BURNT THEM ALIVE
7859-102519-0017 THE NEW EMPEROR WAS NOT A MAN OF CAPACITY AND HAD BEEN DRIVEN INTO REBELLION BY HIS FEARS RATHER THAN HIS AMBITION HE HELD THE THRONE BARELY THREE YEARS AMID CONSTANT REVOLTS AT HOME AND DEFEATS ABROAD
7859-102519-0018 THE ASIATIC FRONTIER WAS RAVAGED BY THE ARMIES OF ABDALMALIK AND AT THE SAME TIME A GREAT DISASTER BEFEL THE WESTERN HALF OF THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0019 WHERE THE ROMANS HAD STILL MAINTAINED THEMSELVES BY HARD FIGHTING
7859-102519-0020 HIS TROOPS GAINED SEVERAL VICTORIES OVER THE SARACENS
7859-102519-0021 AND EVEN INVADED NORTHERN SYRIA
7859-102519-0022 THE PEOPLE AND ARMY WERE OUT OF HAND THE EPHEMERAL EMPEROR COULD COUNT ON NO LOYALTY AND ANY SHOCK WAS SUFFICIENT TO UPSET HIS PRECARIOUS THRONE WE MUST NOW TURN TO THE BANISHED JUSTINIAN
7859-102519-0023 WHO HAD BEEN SENT INTO EXILE WITH HIS NOSE MUTILATED HE HAD BEEN TRANSPORTED TO CHERSON THE GREEK TOWN IN THE CRIMEA CLOSE TO THE MODERN SEBASTOPOL WHICH FORMED THE NORTHERNMOST OUTPOST OF CIVILIZATION
7859-102519-0024 AND ENJOYED MUNICIPAL LIBERTY UNDER THE SUZERAINTY OF THE EMPIRE JUSTINIAN DISPLAYED IN HIS DAY OF ADVERSITY A DEGREE OF CAPACITY WHICH ASTONISHED HIS CONTEMPORARIES HE FLED FROM CHERSON AND TOOK REFUGE WITH THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS
7859-102519-0025 THE TARTAR TRIBE WHO DWELT EAST OF THE SEA OF AZOF WITH THIS PRINCE THE EXILE SO INGRATIATED HIMSELF THAT HE RECEIVED IN MARRIAGE HIS SISTER WHO WAS BAPTIZED AND CHRISTENED THEODORA
7859-102519-0026 TO INDUCE HIM TO SURRENDER JUSTINIAN AND THE TREACHEROUS BARBARIAN DETERMINED TO ACCEPT THE BRIBE AND SENT SECRET ORDERS TO TWO OF HIS OFFICERS
7859-102519-0027 THE EMPEROR LEARNT OF THE PLOT THROUGH HIS WIFE AND SAVED HIMSELF BY THE BOLD EXPEDIENT OF GOING AT ONCE TO ONE OF THE TWO KHAZAR CHIEFS AND ASKING FOR A SECRET INTERVIEW WHEN THEY WERE ALONE HE FELL ON HIM AND STRANGLED HIM
7859-102519-0028 AND THEN CALLING ON THE SECOND KHAZAR SERVED HIM IN THE SAME FASHION BEFORE THE KHAN'S ORDERS HAD BEEN DIVULGED TO ANY ONE THIS GAVE HIM TIME TO ESCAPE AND HE FLED IN A FISHING BOAT OUT INTO THE EUXINE WITH A FEW FRIENDS AND SERVANTS WHO HAD FOLLOWED HIM INTO EXILE
7859-102519-0029 WHILE THEY WERE OUT AT SEA A STORM AROSE AND THE BOAT BEGAN TO FILL ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS CRIED TO JUSTINIAN TO MAKE HIS PEACE WITH GOD AND PARDON HIS ENEMIES ERE HE DIED BUT THE EMPEROR'S STERN SOUL WAS NOT BENT BY THE TEMPEST
7859-102519-0030 MAY GOD DROWN ME HERE HE ANSWERED
7859-102519-0031 THE BOAT WEATHERED THE STORM AND JUSTINIAN SURVIVED TO CARRY OUT HIS CRUEL OATH HE CAME ASHORE IN THE LAND OF THE BULGARIANS AND SOON WON FAVOUR WITH THEIR KING TERBEL WHO WANTED A GOOD EXCUSE FOR INVADING THE EMPIRE
7859-102519-0032 AND FOUND IT IN THE PRETENCE OF SUPPORTING THE EXILED MONARCH WITH A BULGARIAN ARMY AT HIS BACK JUSTINIAN APPEARED BEFORE CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0033 THERE WAS NO FIGHTING FOR THE ADHERENTS OF TIBERIUS WERE AS UNREADY TO STRIKE A BLOW FOR THEIR MASTER
7859-102519-0034 SO JUSTINIAN RECOVERED HIS THRONE WITHOUT FIGHTING FOR THE PEOPLE HAD BY THIS TIME HALF FORGOTTEN HIS TYRANNY AND REGRETTED THE RULE OF THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS BUT THEY WERE SOON TO FIND OUT THAT THEY HAD ERRED IN SUBMITTING TO THE EXILE
7859-102519-0035 AND SHOULD HAVE RESISTED HIM AT ALL HAZARDS JUSTINIAN CAME BACK IN A RELENTLESS MOOD BENT ON NOTHING BUT REVENGING HIS MUTILATED NOSE AND HIS TEN YEARS OF EXILE HIS FIRST ACT WAS TO SEND FOR THE TWO USURPERS WHO HAD SAT ON HIS THRONE
7859-102519-0036 AS HE TRIED TO FLEE INTO ASIA JUSTINIAN HAD THEM LED ROUND THE CITY IN CHAINS AND THEN BOUND THEM SIDE BY SIDE BEFORE HIS THRONE IN THE CATHISMA THE IMPERIAL BOX AT THE HIPPODROME
7859-102519-0037 THERE HE SAT IN STATE USING THEIR PROSTRATE BODIES AS A FOOTSTOOL WHILE HIS ADHERENTS CHANTED THE VERSE FROM THE NINETY FIRST PSALM THOU SHALT TREAD ON THE LION AND ASP THE YOUNG LION AND DRAGON SHALT THOU TRAMPLE UNDER THY FEET
7859-102519-0038 AND APSIMARUS AFTER THIS STRANGE EXHIBITION THE TWO EX EMPERORS WERE BEHEADED THEIR EXECUTION BEGAN A REIGN OF TERROR FOR JUSTINIAN HAD HIS OATH TO KEEP AND WAS SET ON WREAKING VENGEANCE ON EVERY ONE WHO HAD BEEN CONCERNED IN HIS DEPOSITION
7859-102519-0039 AND PUT OUT THE EYES OF THE PATRIARCH WHO HAD CROWNED HIM THEN HE SET TO WORK TO HUNT OUT MEANER VICTIMS MANY PROMINENT CITIZENS OF CONSTANTINOPLE WERE SOWN UP IN SACKS AND DROWNED IN THE BOSPHORUS SOLDIERS WERE PICKED OUT BY THE DOZEN AND BEHEADED
7859-102519-0040 A SPECIAL EXPEDITION WAS SENT BY SEA TO SACK CHERSON THE CITY OF THE EMPEROR'S EXILE BECAUSE HE HAD A GRUDGE AGAINST ITS CITIZENS THE CHIEF MEN WERE CAUGHT AND SENT TO THE CAPITAL WHERE JUSTINIAN HAD THEM BOUND TO SPITS AND ROASTED
7859-102519-0041 THESE ATROCITIES WERE MERE SAMPLES OF THE GENERAL CONDUCT OF JUSTINIAN IN A FEW YEARS HE HAD MADE HIMSELF SO MUCH DETESTED THAT IT MIGHT BE SAID THAT HE HAD BEEN COMPARATIVELY POPULAR IN THE DAYS OF HIS FIRST REIGN
7859-102519-0042 THE ARMY OF THE TYRANT LAID DOWN THEIR ARMS WHEN PHILIPPICUS APPROACHED AND HE WAS LED FORTH AND BEHEADED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY AN END TOO GOOD FOR SUCH A MONSTER THE CONQUEROR ALSO SOUGHT OUT AND SLEW HIS LITTLE SON TIBERIUS
7859-102519-0043 WHOM THE SISTER OF THE KHAN OF THE KHAZARS HAD BORNE TO HIM DURING HIS EXILE SO ENDED THE HOUSE OF HERACLIUS AFTER IT HAD SAT FOR FIVE GENERATIONS AND ONE HUNDRED AND ONE YEARS ON THE THRONE OF CONSTANTINOPLE
7859-102519-0044 THE SIX YEARS WHICH FOLLOWED WERE PURELY ANARCHICAL JUSTINIAN'S WILD AND WICKED FREAKS HAD COMPLETED THE DEMORALIZATION WHICH HAD ALREADY SET IN BEFORE HIS RESTORATION EVERYTHING IN THE ARMY AND THE STATE WAS COMPLETELY DISORGANIZED AND OUT OF GEAR
7859-102519-0045 IT REQUIRED A HERO TO RESTORE THE MACHINERY OF GOVERNMENT AND EVOLVE ORDER OUT OF CHAOS BUT THE HERO WAS NOT AT ONCE FORTHCOMING AND THE CONFUSION WENT ON INCREASING
7859-102519-0046 TO REPLACE JUSTINIAN BY PHILIPPICUS WAS ONLY TO SUBSTITUTE KING LOG FOR KING STORK THE NEW EMPEROR WAS A MERE MAN OF PLEASURE AND SPENT HIS TIME IN PERSONAL ENJOYMENT LETTING AFFAIRS OF STATE SLIDE ON AS BEST THEY MIGHT
7859-102519-0047 IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS HE WAS UPSET BY A CONSPIRACY
7859-102519-0048 PHILIPPICUS WAS BLINDED AND COMPELLED TO EXCHANGE THE PLEASURES OF THE PALACE FOR THE RIGOURS OF A MONASTERY BUT THE COURT INTRIGUE WHICH DETHRONED PHILIPPICUS DID NOT PLEASE THE ARMY
7859-102519-0049 WHO GAVE THE IMPERIAL CROWN TO THEODOSIUS OF ADRAMMYTIUM A RESPECTABLE BUT OBSCURE COMMISSIONER OF TAXES MORE MERCIFUL THAN ANY OF HIS EPHEMERAL PREDECESSORS
7859-102519-0050 AFTER COMPELLING HIM TO TAKE HOLY ORDERS MEANWHILE THE ORGANIZATION OF THE EMPIRE WAS VISIBLY BREAKING UP THE AFFAIRS BOTH OF THE REALM AND THE CITY WERE NEGLECTED AND DECAYING CIVIL EDUCATION WAS DISAPPEARING AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE DISSOLVED
7859-102519-0051 AND EVERY YEAR THEIR RAVAGES PENETRATED FURTHER INLAND
7859-102519-0052 WITH THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF LAYING SIEGE TO CONSTANTINOPLE NO ONE HINDERED HIM FOR THE ARMY RAISED TO SERVE AGAINST HIM
7859-102519-0053 THEY HAD PENETRATED INTO PHRYGIA
7859-102519-0054 WITH EVERY EXPECTATION OF SUCCESS WHEN AT LAST THERE APPEARED THE MAN WHO WAS DESTINED TO SAVE THE EAST ROMAN EMPIRE FROM A PREMATURE DISMEMBERMENT
7859-102519-0055 WHO HAD MADE A GREAT REPUTATION AMID THE FEARFUL DISASTERS OF THE LAST TEN YEARS HE WAS NOW GENERAL OF THE ANATOLIC THEME THE PROVINCE WHICH INCLUDED THE OLD CAPPADOCIA AND LYCAONIA AFTER INDUCING THE SARACENS MORE BY CRAFT THAN FORCE
7859-102519-0056 TO RAISE THE SIEGE OF AMORIUM LEO DISOWNED HIS ALLEGIANCE TO THE INCAPABLE THEODOSIUS AND MARCHED TOWARD THE BOSPHORUS THE UNFORTUNATE EMPEROR WHO HAD NOT COVETED THE THRONE HE OCCUPIED NOR MUCH DESIRED TO RETAIN IT
7859-102521-0000 THE ICONOCLASTS
7859-102521-0001 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WELL FOR HIS REPUTATION IN HISTORY UNHAPPILY FOR HIMSELF THOUGH HAPPILY ENOUGH FOR THE EAST ROMAN REALM HE SURVIVED YET TWENTY YEARS TO CARRY THROUGH A SERIES OF MEASURES WHICH WERE IN HIS EYES NOT LESS IMPORTANT THAN THE REPULSE OF THE MOSLEMS FROM HIS CAPITAL
7859-102521-0002 HISTORIANS HAVE GIVEN TO THE SCHEME OF REFORM WHICH HE TOOK IN HAND THE NAME OF THE ICONOCLASTIC MOVEMENT BECAUSE OF THE OPPOSITION TO THE WORSHIP OF IMAGES WHICH FORMED ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURES OF HIS ACTION
7859-102521-0003 FOR THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THE EMPIRE HAD BEEN DECLINING IN CULTURE AND CIVILIZATION LITERATURE AND ART SEEMED LIKELY TO PERISH IN THE NEVER ENDING CLASH OF ARMS THE OLD ROMAN JURISPRUDENCE WAS BEING FORGOTTEN
7859-102521-0004 THE RACE OF EDUCATED CIVIL SERVANTS WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF EXTINCTION THE GOVERNORS OF PROVINCES WERE NOW WITHOUT EXCEPTION ROUGH SOLDIERS NOT MEMBERS OF THAT OLD BUREAUCRACY WHOSE ROMAN TRADITIONS HAD SO LONG KEPT THE EMPIRE TOGETHER
7859-102521-0005 NOT LEAST AMONG THE SIGNS OF A DECAYING CIVILIZATION WERE THE GROSS SUPERSTITIONS WHICH HAD GROWN UP OF LATE IN THE RELIGIOUS WORLD
7859-102521-0006 UNNOTICED AND UNGUARDED AGAINST BY THEOLOGIANS WHO DEVOTED ALL THEIR ENERGIES TO THE BARREN MONOTHELITE AND MONOPHYSITE CONTROVERSIES IMAGE WORSHIP AND RELIC WORSHIP IN PARTICULAR HAD DEVELOPED WITH STRANGE RAPIDITY AND ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF MERE FETISHISM
7859-102521-0007 SLAVS AND BULGARIANS ALL OF WHOM HE BEAT BACK WITH GREAT SLAUGHTER ON THE NUMEROUS OCCASIONS WHEN THEY INVADED THE EMPIRE BUT IN THE MINDS BOTH OF CONSTANTINE HIMSELF AND OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES HIS DEALINGS WITH THINGS RELIGIOUS WERE THE MAIN FEATURE OF HIS REIGN
7859-102521-0008 AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS BEGUN TO CLOSE MONASTERIES WHOLESALE WE ARE TOLD THAT HE COMPELLED MANY OF THEIR INMATES TO MARRY BY FORCE OF THREATS OTHERS WERE EXILED TO CYPRUS BY THE HUNDRED NOT A FEW WERE FLOGGED AND IMPRISONED
7859-102521-0009 THESE UNWISE MEASURES HAD THE NATURAL EFFECT THE MONKS WERE EVERYWHERE REGARDED AS MARTYRS AND THE IMAGE WORSHIP WHICH THEY SUPPORTED GREW MORE THAN EVER POPULAR WITH THE MASSES WHILE STILL IN THE FULL VIGOUR OF HIS PERSECUTING ENTHUSIASM
7859-102521-0010 WHILE THE EMPRESS DOWAGER IRENE BECAME SOLE REGENT AND HER NAME WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT OF HER SON IN ALL ACTS OF STATE
7859-102521-0011 BUT IN HIS TWENTY SECOND YEAR HE REBELLED AGAINST HIS MOTHER'S DICTATION AND TOOK HIS PLACE AT THE HELM OF THE STATE IRENE HAD ACTUALLY STRIVEN TO OPPOSE HIM BY ARMED FORCE BUT HE PARDONED HER AND AFTER SECLUDING HER FOR A SHORT TIME
7859-102521-0012 RESTORED HER TO HER FORMER DIGNITY THE UNNATURAL MOTHER WAS FAR FROM ACQUIESCING IN HER SON'S ELEVATION
7859-102521-0013 SEIZED THE YOUNG EMPEROR BLINDED HIM AND IMMURED HIM IN A MONASTERY BEFORE ANY OF HIS ADHERENTS WERE ABLE TO COME TO HIS AID
7859-102521-0014 HER GRAND TREASURER HAVING GAINED OVER SOME OF THE EUNUCHS AND OTHER COURTIERS ABOUT HER PERSON
7859-102521-0015 THE ICONOCLASTIC CONTROVERSY HAD PREPARED THE WAY FOR IT WHILE THE FACT THAT A WOMAN SAT ON THE IMPERIAL THRONE SERVED AS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR THE POPE'S ACTION LEO DECLARED THAT A FEMALE REIGN WAS AN ANOMALY AND AN ABOMINATION
7859-102521-0016 AND TOOK UPON HIMSELF THE ONUS OF ENDING IT SO FAR AS ITALY WAS CONCERNED BY CREATING A NEW EMPEROR OF THE WEST
7859-102521-0017 THERE WAS OF COURSE NO LEGALITY IN THE ACT AND KARL THE GREAT WAS IN NO REAL SENSE THE SUCCESSOR OF HONORIUS AND ROMULUS AUGUSTULUS BUT HE RULED A GROUP OF KINGDOMS WHICH EMBRACED THE LARGER HALF OF THE OLD WESTERN EMPIRE AND FORMED A FAIR EQUIPOISE TO THE REALM NOW RULED BY IRENE FROM EIGHT HUNDRED THEN ONWARD WE HAVE ONCE MORE A WEST ROMAN EMPIRE IN EXISTENCE AS WELL AS THE EAST ROMAN

8014-112586-0005 I FANCY OPEN THEIR EYES THEY WILL LEARN FROM IT THAT THE OLD IRISH SO FAR FROM BEING BARBAROUS WERE A BRIGHT INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURED PEOPLE THAT THEY HAD PROFESSIONS TRADES AND INDUSTRIES PERVADING THE WHOLE POPULATION
8014-112586-0006 WITH CLEARLY DEFINED RANKS AND GRADES OF SOCIETY ALL WORKING UNDER AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF NATIVE LAWS AND THAT IN THE STEADYING AND CIVILISING ARTS AND PURSUITS OF EVERYDAY LIFE THEY WERE AS WELL ADVANCED AS ORDERLY
8014-112586-0007 AND AS REGULAR AS ANY OTHER EUROPEAN PEOPLE OF THE SAME PERIOD THEY WILL FIND TOO THAT AS REGARDS EDUCATION SCHOLARSHIP AND GENERAL MENTAL CULTURE THE IRISH OF THOSE EARLY AGES WERE IN ADVANCE OF ALL OTHER COUNTRIES OF EUROPE
8014-112586-0008 THAT THEY HELPED MOST MATERIALLY TO SPREAD CHRISTIANITY AND TO REVIVE LEARNING ALL OVER THE CONTINENT AND THAT TO IRISH MISSIONARIES AND SCHOLARS THE ANGLO SAXONS OF THE HEPTARCHY WERE INDEBTED FOR THE GREATER PART OF THEIR CHRISTIANITY
8014-112586-0009 AND FOR THE PRESERVATION AND RESTORATION OF LEARNING WHEN IT WAS THREATENED WITH EXTINCTION ALL OVER ENGLAND BY THE RAVAGES OF THE DANES BUT THERE WERE AND ARE ENGLISHMEN BETTER INFORMED ABOUT OUR COUNTRY
8014-112586-0010 MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS AGO THE GREAT ENGLISH POET EDMUND SPENSER LIVED FOR SOME TIME IN IRELAND AND MADE HIMSELF WELL ACQUAINTED WITH ITS HISTORY HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS IN PAST AGES
8014-112586-0011 OF WEALTH AND GOODNESSE FAR ABOVE THE REST
8014-112586-0012 BUT IT IS BETTER NOT TO PURSUE THESE OBSERVATIONS FARTHER HERE AS IT WOULD BE ONLY ANTICIPATING WHAT WILL BE FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK THIS BOOK IS THE LAST OF A SERIES OF THREE OF WHICH THE SECOND IS ABRIDGED FROM THE FIRST AND THE THIRD FROM BOTH
8014-112586-0013 THE FIRST A SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0014 CONTAINS A COMPLETE SURVEY OF THE SOCIAL LIFE AND INSTITUTIONS OF ANCIENT IRELAND ALL THE IMPORTANT STATEMENTS IN IT ARE PROVED HOME BY REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES
8014-112586-0015 THE SECOND A SMALLER SOCIAL HISTORY OF ANCIENT IRELAND
8014-112586-0016 FIVE HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT PAGES IN TWENTY SEVEN CHAPTERS WITH TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN ILLUSTRATIONS TRAVERSES THE SAME GROUND AS THE LARGER WORK BUT BESIDES CONDENSATION MOST OF THE ILLUSTRATIVE QUOTATIONS AND NEARLY ALL THE REFERENCES TO AUTHORITIES ARE OMITTED
8014-112586-0017 THIS THIRD BOOK THE STORY OF ANCIENT IRISH CIVILISATION GIVES IN SIMPLE PLAIN LANGUAGE AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY IN THE OLDEN TIME BUT AS IT IS HERE TO SPEAK FOR ITSELF I NEED NOT DESCRIBE IT FURTHER
8014-112586-0018 FOR ALL THE STATEMENTS IT CONTAINS FULL AND SATISFACTORY AUTHORITIES WILL BE FOUND IN THE TWO LARGER WORKS I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE ALL THREE READABLE AND INTERESTING AS WELL AS INSTRUCTIVE
8014-112586-0019 THE ORDINARY HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY HAS BEEN WRITTEN BY MANY AND THE READER HAS A WIDE CHOICE BUT IN THE MATTER OF OUR SOCIAL HISTORY HE HAS NO CHOICE AT ALL FOR THESE THREE BOOKS OF MINE HAVE FOR THE FIRST AND ONLY TIME
8014-112586-0020 BROUGHT WITHIN THE REACH OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC A KNOWLEDGE OF THE WHOLE SOCIAL LIFE OF ANCIENT IRELAND P W J LYRE NA GRENA FEBRUARY
8014-112602-0000 AN OVAL FACE BROAD ABOVE AND NARROW BELOW GOLDEN HAIR FAIR SKIN WHITE DELICATE AND WELL FORMED HANDS WITH SLENDER TAPERING FINGERS THESE WERE CONSIDERED AS MARKING THE TYPE OF BEAUTY AND OF HIGH FAMILY DESCENT
8014-112602-0001 THEY WERE THE MARKS OF ARISTOCRACY TO THESE NATURAL ADVANTAGES THE PEOPLE ADDED BY THE USUAL ARTIFICIAL MEANS AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FINGER NAILS WERE KEPT CAREFULLY CUT AND ROUNDED
8014-112602-0002 IT WAS CONSIDERED SHAMEFUL FOR A MAN OF POSITION TO HAVE ROUGH UNKEMPT NAILS CRIMSON COLOURED FINGER NAILS WERE GREATLY ADMIRED
8014-112602-0003 I SLEEP NO MORE AND I SHALL NOT CRIMSON MY NAILS NO JOY SHALL EVER AGAIN COME UPON MY MIND
8014-112602-0004 LADIES OFTEN DYED THE EYEBROWS BLACK WITH THE JUICE OF SOME SORT OF BERRY
8014-112602-0005 THAT THE IRISH MISSIONARY MONKS SOMETIMES PAINTED OR DYED THEIR EYELIDS BLACK AN ENTRY IN CORMAC'S GLOSSARY PLAINLY INDICATES THAT THE BLUSH OF THE CHEEKS WAS SOMETIMES HEIGHTENED BY A COLOURING MATTER OBTAINED FROM THE ALDER TREE
8014-112602-0006 AND THE SPRIGS AND BERRIES OF THE ELDER WERE APPLIED TO THE SAME PURPOSE AMONG GREEK AND ROMAN LADIES THE PRACTICE WAS VERY GENERAL OF PAINTING THE CHEEKS EYEBROWS AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FACE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN WORE THE HAIR LONG
8014-112602-0007 THE HAIR WAS COMBED DAILY AFTER A BATH THE HEROES OF THE FENA OF ERIN BEFORE SITTING DOWN TO THEIR DINNER AFTER A HARD DAY'S HUNTING ALWAYS TOOK A BATH AND CAREFULLY COMBED THEIR LONG HAIR AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES IN VERY EARLY TIMES
8014-112602-0008 GREAT CARE WAS BESTOWED ON THE HAIR ITS REGULATION CONSTITUTED QUITE AN ART AND IT WAS DRESSED UP IN SEVERAL WAYS VERY OFTEN THE LONG HAIR OF MEN AS WELL AS OF WOMEN WAS ELABORATELY CURLED CONALL KERNACH'S HAIR AS DESCRIBED IN THE STORY OF DA DERGA
8014-112602-0009 FLOWED DOWN HIS BACK AND WAS DONE UP IN
8014-112602-0010 HOOKS AND PLAITS AND SWORDLETS
8014-112602-0011 THE ACCURACY OF THIS AND OTHER SIMILAR DESCRIPTIONS IS FULLY BORNE OUT BY THE MOST UNQUESTIONABLE AUTHORITY OF ALL NAMELY THE FIGURES IN THE EARLY ILLUMINATED MANUSCRIPTS AND ON THE SHRINES AND HIGH CROSSES OF LATER AGES
8014-112602-0012 IN NEARLY ALL THE FIGURES OF THE BOOK OF KELLS FOR EXAMPLE SEVENTH OR EIGHTH CENTURY THE HAIR IS COMBED AND DRESSED WITH THE UTMOST CARE SO BEAUTIFULLY ADJUSTED INDEED THAT IT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE ONLY BY SKILLED PROFESSIONAL HAIRDRESSERS
8014-112602-0013 AND MUST HAVE OCCUPIED MUCH TIME WHETHER IN CASE OF MEN OR WOMEN
8014-112602-0014 AND IS COMMONLY DIVIDED THE WHOLE WAY AS WELL AS ALL OVER THE HEAD INTO SLENDER FILLETS OR LOCKS WHICH SOMETIMES HANG DOWN TO THE EYES IN FRONT I DO NOT FIND MENTIONED ANYWHERE THAT THE IRISH DYED THEIR HAIR AS WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG THE GREEKS AND ROMANS
8014-112602-0015 THE MEN WERE AS PARTICULAR ABOUT THE BEARD AS ABOUT THE HAIR THE FASHION OF WEARING THE BEARD VARIED
8014-112602-0016 AND GRADUALLY NARROWED TO TWO POINTS BELOW SOMETIMES AS SHOWN IN MANY ANCIENT FIGURES IT FALLS DOWN IN A SINGLE MASS WHILE IN A FEW IT IS CUT STRAIGHT ACROSS AT BOTTOM NOT UNLIKE ASSYRIAN BEARDS NEARLY ALL HAVE A MUSTACHE
8014-112602-0017 IN MOST CASES CURLED UP AND POINTED AT THE ENDS AS WE OFTEN SEE NOW IN MANY THE BEARD IS CAREFULLY DIVIDED INTO SLENDER TWISTED FILLETS AS DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE HAIR KINGS AND CHIEFS HAD BARBERS IN THEIR SERVICE TO ATTEND TO ALL THIS
8014-112602-0018 RAZORS WERE USED MADE OF BRONZE AS HARD AS STEEL AS WE KNOW BY FINDING THEM MENTIONED IN IRISH DOCUMENTS AS EARLY AS THE EIGHTH CENTURY AND MANY OLD BRONZE RAZORS ARE NOW PRESERVED IN MUSEUMS
8014-112602-0019 FROM WHAT PRECEDES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT COMBS WERE IN GENERAL USE WITH MEN AS WELL AS WITH WOMEN AND MANY SPECIMENS OF COMBS ARE NOW FOUND IN THE REMAINS OF ANCIENT DWELLINGS BATHING WAS VERY USUAL AT LEAST AMONG THE UPPER CLASSES
8014-112602-0020 AND BATHS AND THE USE OF BATHS ARE CONSTANTLY MENTIONED IN THE OLD TALES AND OTHER WRITINGS IN EVERY PUBLIC HOSTEL IN EVERY MONASTERY AND IN EVERY HIGH CLASS HOUSE THERE WAS A BATH WITH ITS ACCOMPANIMENTS SOAP WAS USED BOTH IN BATHING AND WASHING
8014-112602-0021 THE MODES OF MANUFACTURING THEM WILL BE MENTIONED SILK AND SATIN WHICH WERE OF COURSE IMPORTED WERE MUCH WORN AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES THE FURS OF ANIMALS SUCH AS SEALS OTTERS BADGERS FOXES ET CETERA WERE MUCH USED FOR CAPES AND JACKETS
8014-112602-0022 AND FOR THE EDGINGS OF VARIOUS GARMENTS SO THAT SKINS OF ALL THE VARIOUS KINDS WERE VALUABLE THEY FORMED TOO AN IMPORTANT ITEM OF EVERYDAY TRAFFIC AND THEY WERE ALSO EXPORTED THE ANCIENT IRISH LOVED BRIGHT COLOURS
8014-112602-0023 IN THIS RESPECT THEY RESEMBLED MANY OTHER NATIONS OF ANTIQUITY AS WELL INDEED AS OF THE PRESENT DAY AND THEY ILLUSTRATED RUSKIN'S SAYING
8014-112602-0024 WHENEVER MEN ARE NOBLE THEY LOVE BRIGHT COLOUR
8014-112602-0025 IN SKY SEA FLOWERS
8014-112602-0026 AND WE KNOW THAT THEY WELL UNDERSTOOD THE ART OF DYEING THE SEVERAL ARTICLES OF DRESS ON ONE PERSON WERE USUALLY COLOURED DIFFERENTLY EVEN THE SINGLE OUTER CLOAK WAS OFTEN STRIPED SPOTTED OR CHEQUERED IN VARIOUS COLOURS KING DOMNALL IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY
8014-112602-0027 ON ONE OCCASION SENT A MANY COLOURED TUNIC TO HIS FOSTER SON PRINCE CONGAL LIKE JOSEPH'S COAT OF MANY COLOURS A VERY COMMON ARTICLE OF DRESS WAS A LARGE CLOAK GENERALLY WITHOUT SLEEVES
8014-112602-0028 VARYING IN LENGTH BUT COMMONLY COVERING THE WHOLE PERSON FROM THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE PEOPLE ALSO WORE A TIGHT FITTING COAT WITH SLEEVES
8014-112602-0029 BUT IT WAS MUCH SHORTER AND WITHOUT A COLLAR
8014-112602-0030 A SHORT CAPE WAS OFTEN WORN ON THE SHOULDERS SOMETIMES CARRYING A HOOD TO COVER THE HEAD THE OUTER COVERING OF THE GENERAL RUN OF THE PEASANTRY WAS JUST ONE LOOSE SLEEVED COAT OR MANTLE
8014-112602-0031 WHICH COVERED THEM DOWN TO THE ANKLES AND WHICH THEY WORE WINTER AND SUMMER WOMEN COMMONLY WORE A LONG LOOSE CLOAK WITH A HOOD A FASHION WHICH IS COMMON AT THE PRESENT DAY THE OVER GARMENTS WERE FASTENED BY BROOCHES PINS BUTTONS
8014-112602-0032 GIRDLES STRINGS AND LOOPS MANY OF THEM BEAUTIFULLY MADE AND ORNAMENTED THE ANCIENT IRISH WORE A TROUSERS WHICH WAS SO TIGHT FITTING AS TO SHOW PERFECTLY THE SHAPE OF THE LIMBS WHEN TERMINATING BELOW THE ANKLES IT WAS HELD DOWN BY A SLENDER STRAP PASSING UNDER THE FOOT
8014-112602-0033 LIKE OTHER IRISH GARMENTS IT WAS GENERALLY STRIPED OR SPECKLED IN VARIOUS COLOURS LEGGINGS OF CLOTH OR OF THIN SOFT LEATHER WERE USED AND WERE LACED ON BY STRINGS TIPPED WITH WHITE BRONZE
8014-112602-0034 A KILT WAS OFTEN WORN IN WHICH CASE THE LEGS WERE LEFT BARE AT THE KNEES WITH LEGGINGS BELOW FOR THE KILT IS OF IRISH ORIGIN AND WAS BROUGHT LIKE MANY OTHER FASHIONS BY THE EARLY COLONISTS TO SCOTLAND
8014-112602-0035 AND WHEN NOT ACTUALLY WORN WAS USUALLY CARRIED AMONG OTHER SMALL ARTICLES IN A LADY'S ORNAMENTAL HAND BAG SHOES WERE OFTEN MADE OF UNTANNED HIDE STITCHED WITH THONGS WITH SEVERAL LAYERS FOR A SOLE BUT THERE WAS A MORE SHAPELY SHOE MADE OF FULLY TANNED LEATHER
8014-112602-0036 HAVING SERVICEABLE SOLE AND HEEL AND OFTEN ORNAMENTED WITH PATTERNS STAMPED IN THE IRISH WERE EXCESSIVELY FOND OF PERSONAL ORNAMENTS WHICH AMONG THE HIGHER CLASSES WERE MADE OF EXPENSIVE MATERIALS SUCH AS GOLD SILVER GEMS WHITE BRONZE ET CETERA
8014-112602-0037 THEY WORE RINGS AND BRACELETS OF VARIOUS SHAPES ON THE FINGERS INCLUDING THE THUMB ROUND THE WRIST AND FOREARM AND EVEN ROUND THE LEG ABOVE THE ANKLE
8014-112602-0038 ALL OF WHICH MATERIALS WERE FOUND NATIVE THEY HAD TORQUES FOR THE NECK MADE OF TWISTED GOLD BARS AND THE ELABORATE AND IMMENSELY EXPENSIVE CRESCENTS OR GORGETS
8014-112602-0039 THERE WAS A GOLD ORNAMENT A KIND OF OPEN RING WITH BOSSES OR BUTTONS ON THE ENDS
8014-112602-0040 WORN ON THE BREAST SUSPENDED FROM AN ORNAMENTED BUTTON THIN CIRCULAR GOLD PLATES WERE ALSO WORN FASTENED ON THE BREAST AND AS FOR BROOCHES THEY WERE OF ALL SHAPES AND SIZES SOME PLAIN SIMPLE AND CHEAP
8014-112602-0041 SOME OF GOLD OR OTHER EXPENSIVE MATERIAL OF ELABORATE WORKMANSHIP
8014-280382-0000 FLED TO LARS PORSENNA KING OF CLUSIUM AND BESOUGHT HIM THAT HE WOULD HELP THEM SUFFER NOT THEY SAID THAT WE WHO ARE TUSCANS BY BIRTH SHOULD REMAIN ANY MORE IN POVERTY AND EXILE
8014-280382-0001 AND TAKE HEED ALSO TO THYSELF AND THINE OWN KINGDOM IF THOU PERMIT THIS NEW FASHION OF DRIVING FORTH KINGS TO GO UNPUNISHED
8014-280382-0002 THAT IN FREEDOM WHICH MEN GREATLY DESIRE AND IF THEY THAT BE KINGS DEFEND NOT THEIR DIGNITY AS STOUTLY AS OTHERS SEEK TO OVERTHROW IT THEN SHALL THE HIGHEST BE MADE EVEN AS THE LOWEST AND THERE SHALL BE AN END OF KINGSHIP THAN WHICH THERE IS NOTHING MORE HONORABLE UNDER HEAVEN
8014-280382-0003 WITH THESE WORDS THEY PERSUADED KING PORSENNA WHO JUDGING IT WELL FOR THE ETRURIANS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A KING AT ROME AND THAT KING AN ETRURIAN BY BIRTH GATHERED TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND CAME UP AGAINST ROME
8014-280382-0004 BUT WHEN MEN HEARD OF HIS COMING SO MIGHTY A CITY WAS CLUSIUM IN THOSE DAYS AND SO GREAT THE FAME OF KING PORSENNA
8014-280382-0005 IN THE MEANWHILE I SO FAR AS ONE MAN MAY DO WILL STAY THE ENEMY AND AS HE SPAKE HE RAN FORWARD TO THE FARTHER END OF THE BRIDGE AND MADE READY TO KEEP THE WAY AGAINST THE ENEMY NEVERTHELESS THERE STOOD TWO WITH HIM
8014-280382-0006 LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS BY NAME MEN OF NOBLE BIRTH BOTH OF THEM AND OF GREAT RENOWN IN ARMS SO THESE THREE FOR A WHILE STAYED THE FIRST ONSET OF THE ENEMY AND THE MEN OF ROME MEANWHILE BRAKE DOWN THE BRIDGE AND WHEN THERE WAS BUT A SMALL PART REMAINING
8014-280382-0007 AND THEY THAT BRAKE IT DOWN CALLED TO THE THREE THAT THEY SHOULD COME BACK HORATIUS BADE LARTIUS AND HERMINIUS RETURN BUT HE HIMSELF REMAINED ON THE FARTHER SIDE TURNING HIS EYES FULL OF WRATH IN THREATENING FASHION ON THE PRINCES OF THE ETRURIANS AND CRYING
8014-280382-0008 KING PORSENNA TO ROB OTHERS OF THE FREEDOM THAT YE CARE NOT TO HAVE FOR YOURSELVES
8014-280382-0009 LOOKING EACH MAN TO HIS NEIGHBOR WHO SHOULD FIRST DEAL WITH THIS CHAMPION OF THE ROMANS THEN FOR VERY SHAME THEY ALL RAN FORWARD AND RAISING A GREAT SHOUT THREW THEIR JAVELINS AT HIM THESE ALL HE TOOK UPON HIS SHIELD NOR STOOD THE LESS FIRMLY IN HIS PLACE ON THE BRIDGE
8014-280382-0010 FOR THE BRIDGE WAS NOW ALTOGETHER BROKEN DOWN
8014-280382-0011 AND AS THE ENEMY STAYED A WHILE FOR FEAR HORATIUS TURNED HIM TO THE RIVER AND SAID O FATHER TIBER I BESEECH THEE THIS DAY WITH ALL REVERENCE THAT THOU KINDLY RECEIVE THIS SOLDIER AND HIS ARMS AND AS HE SPAKE HE LEAPT WITH ALL HIS ARMS INTO THE RIVER
8014-280382-0012 AND SWAM ACROSS TO HIS OWN PEOPLE AND THOUGH MANY JAVELINS OF THE ENEMY FELL ABOUT HIM HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT HURT NOR DID SUCH VALOR FAIL TO RECEIVE DUE HONOR FROM THE CITY
8051-118101-0000 IN ORDER TO ECONOMIZE TIME AND SPACE WITH A VIEW TO GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF AS MANY OF THE TRAVELERS AS POSSIBLE IT SEEMS EXPEDIENT WHERE A NUMBER OF ARRIVALS COME IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO EACH OTHER TO REPORT THEM BRIEFLY UNDER ONE HEAD
8051-118101-0001 HENRY ANDERSON ALIAS WILLIAM ANDERSON IN OUTWARD APPEARANCE HENRY WAS UNINTERESTING AS HE ASSERTED AND AS HIS APPEARANCE INDICATED HE HAD EXPERIENCED A LARGE SHARE OF RUGGED USAGE
8051-118101-0002 BEING FAR IN THE SOUTH AND IN THE HANDS OF A BRUTAL CAPTAIN OF A SMALL BOAT CHANCES OF FREEDOM OR OF MODERATE TREATMENT HAD RARELY EVER PRESENTED THEMSELVES IN ANY ASPECT
8051-118101-0003 THE THOUGHT OF HAVING TO LIVE UNDER A TRADER WAS SO TERRIBLE HE WAS MOVED TO ESCAPE LEAVING HIS WIFE TO WHOM HE HAD ONLY BEEN MARRIED THREE MONTHS HENRY WAS TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE
8051-118101-0004 HE FLED FROM BEAUFORT NORTH CAROLINA THE SYSTEM OF SLAVERY IN ALL THE REGION OF COUNTRY WHENCE HENRY CAME EXHIBITED GENERALLY GREAT BRUTALITY AND CRUELTY
8051-118101-0005 CHARLES AND HIS WIFE WERE FORTUNATE IN MANAGING TO FLEE TOGETHER THEIR ATTACHMENT TO EACH OTHER WAS EVIDENTLY TRUE THEY WERE BOTH OWNED BY A FARMER WHO WENT BY THE NAME OF DAVID STEWART AND RESIDED IN MARYLAND
8051-118101-0006 AS HE HAD MORE OF THAT KIND OF STOCK THAN HE HAD USE FOR HE HIRED THEM OUT TO ANOTHER FARMER
8051-118101-0007 HOW MUCH FOR THE WIFE THEY COULD NOT TELL SHE HOWEVER WAS NOT BLESSED WITH GOOD HEALTH THOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAVORED ANY MORE ON THAT ACCOUNT
8051-118101-0008 AROUSED HIM TO SEEK THEIR FREEDOM BY FLIGHT HE RESOLVED TO SPARE NO PAINS TO GIVE HIMSELF NO REST UNTIL THEY WERE BOTH FREE
8051-118101-0009 CHARLES WAS TWENTY EIGHT WITH A GOOD HEAD AND STRIKING FACE AS WELL AS OTHERWISE WELL MADE CHESTNUT COLOR AND INTELLIGENT THOUGH UNABLE TO READ LEFT TWO SISTERS IN BONDAGE
8051-118101-0010 THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGHOUT THE NEIGHBORHOOD WHERE CHARLES AND MARGARET HAD LIVED AND BREATHED AND HAD THEIR EXISTENCE WAS HEAVILY OPPRESSED WITH SLAVERY NO EDUCATION FOR THE FREEMAN OF COLOR MUCH LESS FOR THE SLAVE
8051-118101-0011 THE ORDER OF THE DAY WAS LITERALLY AS FAR AS COLORED MEN WERE CONCERNED NO RIGHTS WHICH WHITE MEN WERE BOUND TO RESPECT CHASKEY BROWN WM HENRY WASHINGTON JAMES ALFRED FRISLEY
8051-118101-0012 AND CHARLES HENRY SALTER CHASKEY IS ABOUT TWENTY FOUR YEARS OF AGE QUITE BLACK MEDIUM SIZE SOUND BODY AND INTELLIGENT APPEARANCE NEVERTHELESS HE RESEMBLED A FARM HAND IN EVERY PARTICULAR
8051-118101-0013 HIS MASTER WAS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF MAJOR JAMES H GALES AND HE WAS THE OWNER OF A FARM WITH EIGHTEEN MEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN SLAVES TO TOIL FOR HIM
8051-118101-0014 THE MAJOR IN DISPOSITION WAS VERY ABUSIVE AND PROFANE THOUGH OLD AND GREY HEADED HIS WIFE WAS PRETTY MUCH THE SAME KIND OF A WOMAN AS HE WAS A MAN ONE WHO DELIGHTED IN MAKING THE SLAVES TREMBLE AT HER BIDDING
8051-118101-0015 CHASKEY WAS A MEMBER OF THE STILL POND CHURCH OF KENT COUNTY MARYLAND OFTEN CHASKEY WAS MADE TO FEEL THE LASH ON HIS BACK NOTWITHSTANDING HIS GOOD STANDING IN THE CHURCH HE HAD A WIFE AND ONE CHILD
8051-118101-0016 IN ESCAPING HE WAS OBLIGED TO LEAVE THEM BOTH
8051-118101-0017 CHARLES HENRY IS ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE OF GOOD PROPORTION NICE LOOKING AND INTELLIGENT BUT TO ROUGH USAGE HE WAS NO STRANGER TO SELECT HIS OWN MASTER WAS A PRIVILEGE NOT ALLOWED
8051-118101-0018 PRIVILEGES OF ALL KINDS WERE RARE WITH HIM SO HE RESOLVED TO FLEE LEFT HIS MOTHER THREE SISTERS AND FIVE BROTHERS IN SLAVERY HE WAS A MEMBER OF ALBANY CHAPEL AT MASSEY'S CROSS ROADS
8051-118101-0019 THESE WERE ALL GLADLY RECEIVED BY THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND THE HAND OF FRIENDSHIP WARMLY EXTENDED TO THEM AND THE BEST OF COUNSEL AND ENCOURAGEMENT WAS OFFERED MATERIAL AID FOOD AND CLOTHING WERE ALSO FURNISHED AS THEY HAD NEED
8051-118101-0020 AND THEY WERE SENT ON THEIR WAY REJOICING TO CANADA STEPHEN TAYLOR CHARLES BROWN CHARLES HENRY HOLLIS AND LUTHER DORSEY STEPHEN WAS A FINE YOUNG MAN OF TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HE FLED TO KEEP FROM BEING SOLD
8051-118101-0021 AND MADE UP HIS MIND TO LEAVE THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY BEFORE THIS WATCHFUL AND RESOLUTE PURPOSE THE WAY OPENED AND HE SOON FOUND IT COMPARATIVELY EASY TO FIND HIS WAY FROM MARYLAND TO PENNSYLVANIA AND LIKEWISE INTO THE HANDS OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE
8051-118101-0022 TO WHOM HE MADE KNOWN FULLY THE CHARACTER OF THE PLACE AND PEOPLE WHENCE HE HAD FLED THE DANGERS HE WAS EXPOSED TO FROM SLAVE HUNTERS AND THE STRONG HOPE HE CHERISHED OF REACHING FREE LAND SOON
8051-118101-0023 BEING A YOUNG MAN OF PROMISE STEPHEN WAS ADVISED EARNESTLY TO APPLY HIS MIND TO SEEK AN EDUCATION AND TO USE EVERY POSSIBLE ENDEAVOR TO RAISE HIMSELF IN THE SCALE OF MANHOOD MORALLY RELIGIOUSLY AND INTELLECTUALLY
8051-118101-0024 AND HE SEEMED TO DRINK IN THE ADMONITIONS THUS GIVEN WITH A RELISH AFTER RECRUITING AND ALL NECESSARY ARRANGEMENTS HAD BEEN MADE FOR HIS COMFORT AND PASSAGE TO CANADA HE WAS DULY FORWARDED
8051-118101-0025 STEPHEN'S PARENTS WERE DEAD ONE BROTHER WAS THE ONLY NEAR RELATIVE HE LEFT IN CHAINS CHARLES BROWN WAS ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE QUITE BLACK AND BORE THE MARKS OF HAVING BEEN USED HARD
8051-118101-0026 THOUGH HIS STOUT AND HEARTY APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE RENDERED HIM VERY DESIRABLE TO A TRADER HE FLED FROM WILLIAM WHEELING OF SANDY HOOK MARYLAND HE SPOKE OF HIS MASTER AS A PRETTY BAD MAN WHO WAS ALWAYS QUARRELING AND WOULD DRINK SWEAR AND LIE
8051-118101-0027 LEFT SIMPLY BECAUSE HE NEVER GOT ANYTHING FOR HIS LABOR
8051-118101-0028 HIS MASTER HE DESCRIBES THUS HIS FACE WAS LONG CHEEK BONES HIGH MIDDLING TALL AND ABOUT TWENTY SIX YEARS OF AGE WITH THIS SPECIMEN OF HUMANITY CHARLES WAS VERY MUCH DISSATISFIED
8051-118101-0029 AND IN MAKING AN EFFORT TO REACH CANADA HE WAS QUITE WILLING TO SUFFER MANY THINGS SO THE FIRST CHANCE CHARLES GOT HE STARTED AND PROVIDENCE SMILED UPON HIS RESOLUTION
8051-118101-0030 TRUE THE THOUGHT OF HIS MOTHER AND BROTHERS LEFT IN THE PRISON HOUSE LARGELY MARRED HIS JOY AS IT DID ALSO THE COMMITTEE'S STILL THE COMMITTEE FELT THAT CHARLES HAD GAINED HIS FREEDOM HONORABLY
8051-118101-0031 CHARLES HENRY WAS A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN ONLY TWENTY YEARS OF AGE AND APPEARED TO POSSESS DOUBLE AS MUCH NATURAL SENSE AS HE WOULD REQUIRE TO TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF JOHN WEBSTER OF SANDY HOOK
8051-118101-0032 AND THIS WAS WHAT MADE CHARLES UNHAPPY UNEDUCATED AS HE WAS HE WAS TOO SENSIBLE TO BELIEVE THAT WEBSTER HAD ANY GOD GIVEN RIGHT TO HIS MANHOOD CONSEQUENTLY HE LEFT BECAUSE HIS MASTER DID NOT TREAT HIM RIGHT
8051-118101-0033 WEBSTER WAS A TALL MAN WITH LARGE BLACK WHISKERS ABOUT FORTY YEARS OF AGE
8051-118101-0034 CHARLES WAS SORRY FOR THE FATE OF HIS SISTERS BUT HE COULD NOT HELP THEM IF HE REMAINED STAYING TO WEAR THE YOKE HE FELT WOULD RATHER MAKE IT WORSE INSTEAD OF BETTER FOR ALL CONCERNED
8051-118101-0035 RATHER SMART BLACK WELL MADE AND WELL CALCULATED FOR A CANADIAN HE WAS PROMPTED TO ESCAPE PURELY FROM THE DESIRE TO BE FREE HE FLED FROM A VERY INSULTING MAN BY THE NAME OF EDWARD SCHRINER FROM THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF SAIRSVILLE MILLS
8051-118101-0036 THIS SCHRINER WAS DESCRIBED AS A LOW CHUNKY MAN WITH GRUM LOOK BIG MOUTH ET CETERA AND WAS A MEMBER OF THE GERMAN REFORMED CHURCH DON'T SWEAR THOUGH MIGHT AS WELL HE WAS SO BAD OTHER WAYS
8051-118101-0037 LUTHER WAS A MEMBER OF THE METHODIST CHURCH AT JONES HILL LEFT HIS FATHER IN CHAINS HIS MOTHER HAD WISELY ESCAPED TO CANADA YEARS BACK WHEN HE WAS BUT A BOY
8051-119902-0000 CHAPTER THREE WAR BREAD BREAD IS THE STAFF OF LIFE FOR ALL NATIONS BUT BREAD DOES NOT NECESSARILY MEAN THE WHEAT LOAF AT ONE TIME AND PLACE IT HAS BEEN BARLEY CAKE
8051-119902-0001 AT ANOTHER OATEN CAKE AND AT ANOTHER CORN PONE BREAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN WHATEVER CEREAL HAPPENED TO BE CONVENIENT EVEN SUCH UNBREADLIKE FOOD AS RICE IS TO SOME RACES WHAT BREAD IS TO US
8051-119902-0002 WHY THEN HAVE WE DEVELOPED OUR WHEAT BREAD HABIT PARTLY BECAUSE WHEAT BREAD HAS BEEN EASY TO GET AND WE HAVE GROWN TO LIKE THE TASTE BUT CHIEFLY BECAUSE WHEAT FLOUR GIVES THE LIGHTEST LOAF
8051-119902-0003 TO UNDERSTAND WHY MAKE A DOUGH WITH A LITTLE WHITE FLOUR AND WATER AND THEN GENTLY KNEAD IT IN COLD WATER THE CONSISTENCY CHANGES THE STARCH IS WASHED OUT AND A RUBBERY STICKY BALL IS LEFT
8051-119902-0004 THE GLUTEN WHICH IS THE PROTEIN OF THE WHEAT IT IS THIS GLUTEN IN THE FLOUR THAT STRETCHES WHEN BREAD RISES AND THEN STIFFENS WHEN IT IS BAKED MAKING A LIGHT POROUS LOAF
8051-119902-0005 WHEAT IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE CEREALS THAT HAS MUCH GLUTEN RYE HAS A LITTLE AND THE OTHERS PRACTICALLY NONE GLUTEN SEEMS TO BE ESSENTIAL TO THE MAKING OF A LIGHT YEAST RAISED LOAF
8051-119902-0006 PRODUCTS RAISED WITH BAKING POWDER FOR WHICH OUR STANDARD OF LIGHTNESS IS DIFFERENT QUICK BREADS LIKE BISCUITS AND MUFFINS AND CAKES DO NOT REQUIRE THE GLUTEN AND CAN EASILY BE MADE FROM SUBSTITUTE CEREALS
8051-119902-0007 HAVE BEEN TRYING TO PRODUCE A WHEATLESS LOAF WHICH IS LIGHT PALATABLE AND SUFFICIENTLY DURABLE TO STAND TRANSPORTATION THE DURABILITY IS A VERY IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION CRUMBLY CORN BREAD CANNOT BE DISTRIBUTED BY BAKERS NOR SERVED TO ARMIES
8051-119902-0008 THE BAKERS REGULATIONS VICTORY BREAD THE BAKERS HAVE CO OPERATED LOYALLY PROBABLY NO OTHER FOOD INDUSTRY HAS BEEN MORE VITALLY AFFECTED BY THE WAR
8051-119902-0009 ALL BAKERS USING THREE OR MORE BARRELS OF FLOUR A MONTH HAVE BEEN LICENSED AND SO ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION THIS MEANS PRACTICALLY ALL THE COMMERCIAL BAKERS OF THE COUNTRY
8051-119902-0010 AND MANY HOTELS CLUBS AND INSTITUTIONS ABOUT TWO FIFTHS OF THE BREAD IN THE UNITED STATES IS MADE IN BAKERIES AND THREE FIFTHS IN THE HOME THE BAKERIES HAVE USED THIRTY FIVE MILLION BARRELS OF FLOUR EACH YEAR
8051-119902-0011 OR IF THEY ARE PASTRY AND CRACKER BAKERS SEVENTY PER CENT THEY MUST MAKE NO BREAD WHOLLY OF WHEAT FLOUR SOME SUBSTITUTE MUST BE MIXED WITH THE WHEAT WHEN THE REGULATION WENT INTO EFFECT IN FEBRUARY NINETEEN EIGHTEEN
8051-119902-0012 TWENTY PER CENT WAS REQUIRED AND LATER TWENTY FIVE PER CENT IN PIES AND CAKES THERE MUST BE AT LEAST ONE THIRD SUBSTITUTE THE AMOUNTS OF SUGAR AND FAT USED ARE LIMITED
8051-119902-0013 EVEN THE SIZES OF THE LOAVES ARE FIXED SO THAT THE EXTRAVAGANCE OF MAKING AND HANDLING ALL SORTS OF FANCY SHAPES AND SIZES MAY BE AVOIDED BREAD MUST NOT BE SOLD TO THE RETAILER AT UNREASONABLE PRICES
8051-119902-0014 VICTORY BREAD IS BREAD MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS THE NAME VICTORY WAS CHOSEN AS REPRESENTING THE IDEA UNDERLYING THE CONSERVATION OF WHEAT
8051-119902-0015 THE NAME IS REALLY A PRESENT TO THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION HAVING BEEN USED BY TWO LARGE FIRMS WHO GAVE UP ALL RIGHTS TO THEIR TRADE MARK
8051-119902-0016 HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE OR SERVE BREAD CONTAINING AT LEAST AS MUCH OF THE WHEAT SUBSTITUTES AS VICTORY BREAD THEY MAY NOT SERVE MORE THAN TWO OUNCES OF BREAD AND OTHER WHEAT PRODUCTS TO A GUEST AT A MEAL
8051-119902-0017 THAT MEANS OF COURSE THAT ONLY THROUGH INTELLIGENT EFFORT CAN THEY SERVE YEAST BREAD
8051-119902-0018 UNTIL THE WHEAT SUPPLY INCREASES AND THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION LESSENS RESTRICTIONS USE NO WHEAT AT ALL IF YOU CAN POSSIBLY DO WITHOUT REMEMBER THAT YOU CAN MAKE DELICIOUS MUFFINS AND OTHER QUICK BREADS FROM THE SUBSTITUTE FLOURS
8051-119902-0019 AND YOU NEED NO BREAD AT ALL AT SOME MEALS AN EXTRA POTATO OR A SERVING OF RICE CAN BE EATEN INSTEAD OF THE USUAL TWO SLICES OF BREAD AND THE BODY WILL BE SUPPLIED WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF ENERGY DO NOT BE THE SLAVE OF OLD FOOD HABITS
8051-119902-0020 WHEN ALL EUROPE IS EATING TO KEEP ALIVE FASTIDIOUSNESS AND FOOD NOTIONS MUST PLAY NO PART IN THE DIETARY
8051-119902-0021 HUNDREDS IN CROWDED CITY QUARTERS HAVE NO FACILITIES OF THEIR OWN FOR BAKING WOMEN DOING THEIR SHARE IN FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS CANNOT GET UP EARLIER TO MAKE CORN BREAD FOR BREAKFAST VICTORY BREAD MUST BE SAVED FOR THEM
8051-119902-0022 FOR HOUSEHOLDS WHICH MUST USE WHEAT
8051-119902-0023 THIS INCLUDES WHEAT IN THE FORM OF BREAD PASTRY MACARONI CRACKERS NOODLES AND BREAKFAST FOODS
8051-119902-0024 THE INTERESTS AND DESIRES OF EACH OF US IN THIS WAR CAN BE TRANSLATED INTO SERVICE IN NO MORE EFFECTIVE WAY THAN BY CONFORMING OUR FOOD HABITS TO THE NEEDS OF THE HOUR FLOUR AND BREAD IN THE ALLIED COUNTRIES
8051-119902-0025 IN ENGLAND THERE ARE LOCAL REGULATIONS ON THE USE OF MASHED POTATO IN BREAD THEIR BREAD MUST BE TWELVE HOURS OLD BEFORE IT IS SOLD SO THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE TEMPTED TO EAT TOO MUCH THE RESULT IS SELDOM PALATABLE
8051-119902-0026 IN FRANCE NO FLOUR AT ALL MAY BE USED TO MAKE THE DELECTABLE PASTRIES AND CAKES WHICH HAVE LONG BEEN THE DELIGHT OF THE FRENCH PEOPLE AND THEIR GUESTS IN ITALY
8051-119902-0027 MUST CONTAIN FORTY THREE PER CENT SUBSTITUTE AND IN SOME PLACES MAY NOT BE MANUFACTURED AT ALL BOTH ENGLAND AND FRANCE HAVE SUBSIDIZED BREAD THE GOVERNMENT HAS SET A PRICE BELOW COST
8051-119902-0028 AND ITSELF MAKES UP THE DIFFERENCE TO THE BAKER ENGLAND HAS APPROPRIATED TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE PURPOSE BREAD RATIONS ARE IN FORCE IN BOTH FRANCE AND ITALY
8051-119902-0029 FRANCE HAS RECENTLY PUT HER WHOLE PEOPLE ON A RIGOROUS RATION WHICH LIMITS THEM TO TWO THIRDS OF THE AMOUNT OF BREAD THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO REMEMBER THAT BREAD IS A FAR MORE IMPORTANT PART OF THE FRENCH DIET THAN OF OURS
8051-119902-0030 RATIONS ARE NOT A GUARANTEE THAT THE AMOUNT MENTIONED WILL BE FORTHCOMING THEY ONLY PERMIT ONE TO HAVE IT IF IT CAN BE OBTAINED
8051-119902-0031 THE VOLUNTARY RATION ALLOWS ONE HALF POUND OF BREAD A DAY FOR SEDENTARY AND UNOCCUPIED WOMEN AND LARGER ALLOWANCES UP TO A LITTLE OVER A POUND FOR MEN DOING HEAVY LABOR
8051-119902-0032 WASTE OF ANY KIND IS VERY HEAVILY PUNISHED ONE WOMAN WAS FINED FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR THROWING AWAY STALE BREAD WHY NOT SEND CORN ABROAD
8051-119902-0033 THE ANSWERS ARE MANY IN THE FIRST PLACE WE ARE SENDING CORN OVER OUR EXPORTS OF CORN DURING MARCH NINETEEN EIGHTEEN INCREASED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY PER CENT AND OF CORN MEAL THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE PER CENT
8051-119902-0034 OVER THE PRE WAR AVERAGE THIS THEY ARE USING AS WE ARE USING IT IN OUR VICTORY BREAD BUT THEY MUST HAVE ENOUGH WHEAT TO MAKE A DURABLE LOAF OF BREAD AT THE BAKESHOPS WHERE FOR GENERATIONS ALL THE BAKING HAS BEEN DONE
8051-119902-0035 AND THE EXTRA UNACCUSTOMED LABOR OF BREAD MAKING CANNOT BE ADDED TO HER BURDENS WHY WE IN THE UNITED STATES DO NOT HAVE BREAD CARDS SOME PEOPLE DISTURBED EITHER SELFISHLY OR PATRIOTICALLY
8051-119902-0036 BY THE FAILURE OF A NEIGHBOR TO CONSERVE WHEAT HAVE ASKED WHY THE FOOD ADMINISTRATION TRUSTS TO VOLUNTARY METHODS WHY IT DOES NOT RATION THE COUNTRY RATIONING MAY COME YET BUT ANY SUCH SYSTEM BRISTLES WITH DIFFICULTIES
8051-119902-0037 THE COST TO THE GOVERNMENT HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY ESTIMATED ALL THE WAY FROM TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FIFTY PER CENT OF THE POPULATION COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED IN THEIR CONSUMPTION BY RATIONING
8051-119902-0038 BUT ON THOSE WITH LITTLE TO SPEND WHO MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR WHOLE FOOD HABITS THE SUCCESS THAT IS MEETING OUR METHOD OF VOLUNTARY REDUCTION OF CONSUMPTION
8051-295385-0000 AND HIS GALLANT ACHIEVEMENTS ON THE DELAWARE CHAPTER ONE HITHERTO MOST VENERABLE AND COURTEOUS READER HAVE I SHOWN THEE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE VALOROUS STUYVESANT UNDER THE MILD MOONSHINE OF PEACE
8051-295385-0001 OR RATHER THE GRIM TRANQUILLITY OF AWFUL EXPECTATION BUT NOW THE WAR DRUM RUMBLES FROM AFAR THE BRAZEN TRUMPET BRAYS ITS THRILLING NOTE
8051-295385-0002 AND THE RUDE CLASH OF HOSTILE ARMS SPEAKS FEARFUL PROPHECIES OF COMING TROUBLES THE GALLANT WARRIOR STARTS FROM SOFT REPOSE FROM GOLDEN VISIONS AND VOLUPTUOUS EASE WHERE IN THE DULCET PIPING TIME OF PEACE
8051-295385-0003 NOR THROUGH THE LIVELONG LAZY SUMMER'S DAY CHANTS FORTH HIS LOVE SICK SOUL IN MADRIGALS TO MANHOOD ROUSED HE SPURNS THE AMOROUS FLUTE DOFFS FROM HIS BRAWNY BACK THE ROBE OF PEACE
8051-295385-0004 AND CLOTHES HIS PAMPERED LIMBS IN PANOPLY OF STEEL O'ER HIS DARK BROW WHERE LATE THE MYRTLE WAVED WHERE WANTON ROSES BREATHED ENERVATE LOVE HE REARS THE BEAMING CASQUE AND NODDING PLUME GRASPS THE BRIGHT SHIELD
8051-295385-0005 EXISTED IN THE CITY OF NEW AMSTERDAM THIS IS BUT A LOFTY AND GIGANTIC MODE IN WHICH WE HEROIC WRITERS ALWAYS TALK OF WAR THEREBY TO GIVE IT A NOBLE AND IMPOSING ASPECT
8051-295385-0006 EQUIPPING OUR WARRIORS WITH BUCKLERS HELMS AND LANCES AND SUCH LIKE OUTLANDISH AND OBSOLETE WEAPONS THE LIKE OF WHICH PERCHANCE THEY HAD NEVER SEEN OR HEARD OF IN THE SAME MANNER THAT A CUNNING STATUARY ARRAYS A MODERN GENERAL OR AN ADMIRAL
8051-295385-0007 IN THE ACCOUTREMENTS OF A CAESAR OR AN ALEXANDER THE SIMPLE TRUTH THEN OF ALL THIS ORATORICAL FLOURISH IS THIS THAT THE VALIANT PETER STUYVESANT ALL OF A SUDDEN FOUND IT NECESSARY
8051-295385-0008 AND PREPARE HIMSELF TO UNDERGO THOSE HARDY TOILS OF WAR IN WHICH HIS MIGHTY SOUL SO MUCH DELIGHTED METHINKS I AT THIS MOMENT BEHOLD HIM IN MY IMAGINATION OR RATHER I BEHOLD HIS GOODLY PORTRAIT
8051-295385-0009 WHICH STILL HANGS IN THE FAMILY MANSION OF THE STUYVESANTS ARRAYED IN ALL THE TERRORS OF A TRUE DUTCH GENERAL HIS REGIMENTAL COAT OF GERMAN BLUE GORGEOUSLY DECORATED WITH A GOODLY SHOW OF LARGE BRASS BUTTONS
8051-295385-0010 REACHING FROM HIS WAISTBAND TO HIS CHIN THE VOLUMINOUS SKIRTS TURNED UP AT THE CORNERS AND SEPARATING GALLANTLY BEHIND SO AS TO DISPLAY THE SEAT OF A SUMPTUOUS PAIR OF BRIMSTONE COLORED TRUNK BREECHES
8051-295385-0011 A GRACEFUL STYLE STILL PREVALENT AMONG THE WARRIORS OF OUR DAY AND WHICH IS IN CONFORMITY TO THE CUSTOM OF ANCIENT HEROES WHO SCORNED TO DEFEND THEMSELVES IN REAR
8051-295385-0012 STUCK WITH A GALLANT AND FIERY AIR OVER HIS LEFT EYE SUCH WAS THE CHIVALRIC PORT OF PETER THE HEADSTRONG AND WHEN HE MADE A SUDDEN HALT PLANTED HIMSELF FIRMLY ON HIS SOLID SUPPORTER
8051-295385-0013 WITH HIS WOODEN LEG INLAID WITH SILVER A LITTLE IN ADVANCE IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN HIS POSITION HIS RIGHT HAND GRASPING A GOLD HEADED CANE HIS LEFT RESTING UPON THE PUMMEL OF HIS SWORD HIS HEAD DRESSING SPIRITEDLY TO THE RIGHT
8051-295385-0014 WITH A MOST APPALLING AND HARD FAVORED FROWN UPON HIS BROW HE PRESENTED ALTOGETHER ONE OF THE MOST COMMANDING BITTER LOOKING AND SOLDIER LIKE FIGURES THAT EVER STRUTTED UPON CANVAS
8051-295385-0015 PROCEED WE NOW TO INQUIRE THE CAUSE OF THIS WARLIKE PREPARATION IN THE PRECEDING CHAPTER WE HAVE SPOKEN OF THE FOUNDING OF FORT CASIMIR AND OF THE MERCILESS WARFARE WAGED BY ITS COMMANDER
8051-295385-0016 UPON CABBAGES SUNFLOWERS AND PUMPKINS FOR WANT OF BETTER OCCASION TO FLESH HIS SWORD NOW IT CAME TO PASS THAT HIGHER UP THE DELAWARE AT HIS STRONGHOLD OF TINNEKONK
8051-295385-0017 WHO STYLED HIMSELF GOVERNOR OF NEW SWEDEN IF HISTORY BELIE NOT THIS REDOUBTABLE SWEDE HE WAS A RIVAL WORTHY OF THE WINDY AND INFLATED COMMANDER OF FORT CASIMIR FOR MASTER DAVID PIETERZEN DE VRIE IN HIS EXCELLENT BOOK OF VOYAGES
8051-295385-0018 DESCRIBES HIM AS WEIGHING UPWARDS OF FOUR HUNDRED POUNDS A HUGE FEEDER AND BOUSER IN PROPORTION TAKING THREE POTATIONS POTTLE DEEP AT EVERY MEAL HE HAD A GARRISON AFTER HIS OWN HEART AT TINNEKONK
8051-295385-0019 GUZZLING DEEP DRINKING SWASHBUCKLERS WHO MADE THE WILD WOODS RING WITH THEIR CAROUSALS NO SOONER DID THIS ROBUSTIOUS COMMANDER HEAR OF THE ERECTION OF FORT CASIMIR THAN HE SENT A MESSAGE TO VAN POFFENBURGH
8051-295385-0020 WARNING HIM OFF THE LAND AS BEING WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF HIS JURISDICTION TO THIS GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH REPLIED THAT THE LAND BELONGED TO THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES HAVING BEEN REGULARLY PURCHASED OF THE NATIVES AS DISCOVERERS
8051-295385-0021 FROM THE MANHATTOES AS WITNESS THE BREECHES OF THEIR LAND MEASURER TEN BROECK TO THIS THE GOVERNOR REJOINED THAT THE LAND HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN SOLD BY THE INDIANS TO THE SWEDES AND CONSEQUENTLY WAS UNDER THE PETTICOAT GOVERNMENT
8051-295385-0022 OF HER SWEDISH MAJESTY CHRISTINA AND WOE BE TO ANY MORTAL THAT WORE A BREECHES WHO SHOULD DARE TO MEDDLE EVEN WITH THE HEM OF HER SACRED GARMENT
8051-295385-0023 I FORBEAR TO DILATE UPON THE WAR OF WORDS WHICH WAS KEPT UP FOR SOME TIME BY THESE WINDY COMMANDERS VAN POFFENBURGH HOWEVER HAD SERVED UNDER WILLIAM THE TESTY AND WAS A VETERAN IN THIS KIND OF WARFARE
8051-295385-0024 GOVERNOR PRINTZ FINDING HE WAS NOT TO BE DISLODGED BY THESE LONG SHOTS NOW DETERMINED UPON COMING TO CLOSER QUARTERS ACCORDINGLY HE DESCENDED THE RIVER IN GREAT FORCE AND FUME AND ERECTED A RIVAL FORTRESS
8051-295385-0025 JUST ONE SWEDISH MILE BELOW FORT CASIMIR TO WHICH HE GAVE THE NAME OF HELSENBURG AND NOW COMMENCED A TREMENDOUS RIVALRY BETWEEN THESE TWO DOUGHTY COMMANDERS STRIVING TO OUTSTRUT AND OUTSWELL EACH OTHER
8051-295385-0026 LIKE A COUPLE OF BELLIGERENT TURKEY COCKS THERE WAS A CONTEST WHO SHOULD RUN UP THE TALLEST FLAG STAFF AND DISPLAY THE BROADEST FLAG ALL DAY LONG THERE WAS A FURIOUS ROLLING OF DRUMS AND TWANGING OF TRUMPETS IN EITHER FORTRESS
8051-295385-0027 AND WHICHEVER HAD THE WIND IN ITS FAVOR WOULD KEEP UP A CONTINUAL FIRING OF CANNON TO TAUNT ITS ANTAGONIST WITH THE SMELL OF GUNPOWDER ON ALL THESE POINTS OF WINDY WARFARE THE ANTAGONISTS WERE WELL MATCHED
8051-295385-0028 BUT SO IT HAPPENED THAT THE SWEDISH FORTRESS BEING LOWER DOWN THE RIVER ALL THE DUTCH VESSELS BOUND TO FORT CASIMIR WITH SUPPLIES HAD TO PASS IT
8051-295385-0029 GOVERNOR PRINTZ AT ONCE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND COMPELLED THEM TO LOWER THEIR FLAGS AS THEY PASSED UNDER THE GUNS OF HIS BATTERY THIS WAS A DEADLY WOUND TO THE DUTCH PRIDE OF GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH
8051-295385-0030 AND SORELY WOULD HE SWELL WHEN FROM THE RAMPARTS OF FORT CASIMIR HE BEHELD THE FLAG OF THEIR HIGH MIGHTINESSES STRUCK TO THE RIVAL FORTRESS TO HEIGHTEN HIS VEXATION GOVERNOR PRINTZ WHO AS HAS BEEN SHOWN WAS A HUGE TRENCHERMAN
8051-295385-0031 IT IS POSSIBLE HE MAY HAVE PAID TO THE DUTCH SKIPPERS THE FULL VALUE OF THEIR COMMODITIES BUT WHAT CONSOLATION WAS THIS TO JACOBUS VAN POFFENBURGH AND HIS GARRISON WHO THUS FOUND THEIR FAVORITE SUPPLIES CUT OFF
8051-295385-0032 AND DIVERTED INTO THE LARDERS OF THE HOSTILE CAMPS FOR SOME TIME THIS WAR OF THE CUPBOARD WAS CARRIED ON TO THE GREAT FESTIVITY AND JOLLIFICATION OF THE SWEDES WHILE THE WARRIORS OF FORT CASIMIR FOUND THEIR HEARTS OR RATHER THEIR STOMACHS
8051-295385-0033 DAILY FAILING THEM AT LENGTH THE SUMMER HEATS AND SUMMER SHOWERS SET IN AND NOW LO AND BEHOLD A GREAT MIRACLE WAS WROUGHT FOR THE RELIEF OF THE NEDERLANDS
8051-295385-0034 FOR IT CAME TO PASS THAT A GREAT CLOUD OF MOSQUITOS AROSE OUT OF THE MARSHY BORDERS OF THE RIVER AND SETTLED UPON THE FORTRESS OF HELSENBURG BEING DOUBTLESS ATTRACTED BY THE SCENT OF THE FRESH BLOOD OF THE SWEDISH GORMANDISERS
8051-295385-0035 NAY IT IS SAID THAT THE BODY OF JAN PRINTZ ALONE
8051-295385-0036 WAS SUFFICIENT TO ATTRACT THE MOSQUITO FROM EVERY PART OF THE COUNTRY FOR SOME TIME THE GARRISON ENDEAVORED TO HOLD OUT BUT IT WAS ALL IN VAIN THE MOSQUITOS PENETRATED INTO EVERY CHINK AND CREVICE AND GAVE THEM NO REST DAY NOR NIGHT
8051-295385-0037 SUCH WAS THE FAMOUS MOSQUITO WAR ON THE DELAWARE OF WHICH GENERAL VAN POFFENBURGH WOULD FAIN HAVE BEEN THE HERO BUT THE DEVOUT PEOPLE OF THE NIEUW NEDERLANDS ALWAYS ASCRIBED THE DISCOMFITURE OF THE SWEDES
8051-295385-0038 TO THE MIRACULOUS INTERVENTION OF SAINT NICHOLAS AS TO THE FORTRESS OF HELSENBURG IT FELL TO RUIN
8063-274112-0000 AND EXCEEDINGLY UNHAPPY IN FACT D'ARTAGNAN D'ARTAGNAN WE SAY FOR WE MUST CALL HIM BY HIS NAME TO REMIND OUR READERS OF HIS EXISTENCE D'ARTAGNAN WE REPEAT
8063-274112-0001 HAD ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHATEVER TO DO AMIDST THESE BRILLIANT BUTTERFLIES OF FASHION AFTER FOLLOWING THE KING DURING TWO WHOLE DAYS AT FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274112-0002 THE MUSKETEER FELT THAT HE NEEDED SOMETHING MORE THAN THIS TO SATISFY THE CRAVINGS OF HIS NATURE AT EVERY MOMENT ASSAILED BY PEOPLE ASKING HIM HOW DO YOU THINK THIS COSTUME SUITS ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN HE WOULD REPLY TO THEM IN QUIET SARCASTIC TONES
8063-274112-0003 WHY I THINK YOU ARE QUITE AS WELL DRESSED AS THE
8063-274112-0004 IT WAS JUST SUCH A COMPLIMENT D'ARTAGNAN WOULD CHOOSE WHERE HE DID NOT FEEL DISPOSED TO PAY ANY OTHER
8063-274112-0005 WHENEVER ANY ONE ASKED HIM HOW DO YOU INTEND TO DRESS YOURSELF THIS EVENING HE REPLIED I SHALL UNDRESS MYSELF AT WHICH THE LADIES ALL LAUGHED
8063-274112-0006 AND ALSO TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE D'ARTAGNAN ASKED THE KING FOR LEAVE OF ABSENCE FOR A MATTER OF PRIVATE BUSINESS AT THE MOMENT D'ARTAGNAN MADE HIS REQUEST
8063-274112-0007 QUITE EXHAUSTED FROM DANCING YOU WISH TO LEAVE ME MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN INQUIRED THE KING WITH AN AIR OF ASTONISHMENT
8063-274112-0008 ANY ONE WHO HAD THE DISTINGUISHED HONOR OF BEING NEAR HIM COULD WISH TO LEAVE HIM SIRE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274112-0009 AH IF I COULD ONLY HOLD THE BALANCING POLE WHILE YOU WERE DANCING IT WOULD BE A VERY DIFFERENT AFFAIR BUT MY DEAR MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN SAID THE KING GRAVELY PEOPLE DANCE WITHOUT BALANCING POLES
8063-274112-0010 AH INDEED SAID THE MUSKETEER CONTINUING HIS IMPERCEPTIBLE TONE OF IRONY
8063-274112-0011 THEREFORE AT FONTAINEBLEAU FOR TO DO SO WOULD BE USELESS BUT WITH THE PERMISSION OF OUR READERS FOLLOW HIM TO THE RUE DES LOMBARDS WHERE HE WAS LOCATED AT THE SIGN OF THE PILON D'OR
8063-274112-0012 AND THE WEATHER WAS EXCEEDINGLY WARM THERE WAS ONLY ONE WINDOW OPEN AND THAT ONE BELONGING TO A ROOM
8063-274112-0013 A PERFUME OF SPICES MINGLED WITH ANOTHER PERFUME LESS EXOTIC BUT MORE PENETRATING NAMELY THAT WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET ASCENDED TO SALUTE THE NOSTRILS OF THE MUSKETEER D'ARTAGNAN RECLINING IN AN IMMENSE STRAIGHT BACKED CHAIR WITH HIS LEGS NOT STRETCHED OUT
8063-274112-0014 BUT SIMPLY PLACED UPON A STOOL FORMED AN ANGLE OF THE MOST OBTUSE FORM THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SEEN BOTH HIS ARMS WERE CROSSED OVER HIS HEAD HIS HEAD RECLINING UPON HIS LEFT SHOULDER LIKE ALEXANDER THE GREAT HIS EYES
8063-274112-0015 USUALLY SO QUICK AND INTELLIGENT IN THEIR EXPRESSION WERE NOW HALF CLOSED AND SEEMED FASTENED AS IT WERE UPON A SMALL CORNER OF BLUE SKY THAT WAS VISIBLE BEHIND THE OPENING OF THE CHIMNEYS
8063-274112-0016 THERE WAS JUST ENOUGH BLUE AND NO MORE TO FILL ONE OF THE SACKS OF LENTILS OR HARICOTS WHICH FORMED THE PRINCIPAL FURNITURE OF THE SHOP ON THE GROUND FLOOR THUS EXTENDED AT HIS EASE AND SHELTERED IN HIS PLACE OF OBSERVATION BEHIND THE WINDOW D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274112-0017 SEEMED AS IF HE HAD CEASED TO BE A SOLDIER AS IF HE WERE NO LONGER AN OFFICER BELONGING TO THE PALACE BUT WAS ON THE CONTRARY A QUIET EASY GOING CITIZEN IN A STATE OF STAGNATION BETWEEN HIS DINNER AND SUPPER OR BETWEEN HIS SUPPER AND HIS BED
8063-274112-0018 WHILE THE WINDOWS OF THE UPPER APARTMENTS WERE BEING CLOSED AND THE RHYTHMIC STEPS OF A PATROL OF SOLDIERS FORMING THE NIGHT WATCH COULD BE HEARD RETREATING D'ARTAGNAN CONTINUED HOWEVER TO THINK OF NOTHING EXCEPT THE BLUE CORNER OF THE SKY A FEW PACES FROM HIM
8063-274112-0019 AND HIS EYES FIXED ON D'ARTAGNAN WHO WAS EITHER THINKING DREAMING OR SLEEPING WITH HIS EYES OPEN
8063-274112-0020 BUT D'ARTAGNAN DID NOT STIR
8063-274112-0021 AFTER A PROLONGED REFLECTION ON THE SUBJECT THE MOST INGENIOUS MEANS THAT SUGGESTED ITSELF TO HIM UNDER THE PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCES WAS TO LET HIMSELF ROLL OFF THE SACK ON TO THE FLOOR MURMURING AT THE SAME TIME AGAINST HIMSELF THE WORD STUPID BUT
8063-274112-0022 NOTWITHSTANDING THE NOISE PRODUCED BY PLANCHET'S FALL D'ARTAGNAN WHO HAD IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXISTENCE HEARD MANY OTHER AND VERY DIFFERENT FALLS DID NOT APPEAR TO PAY THE LEAST ATTENTION TO THE PRESENT ONE BESIDES
8063-274112-0023 AND YET PLANCHET FANCIED THAT IN TOKEN OF TACIT APPROVAL HE SAW HIM IMPERCEPTIBLY SMILE AT THE WORD STUPID THIS EMBOLDENED HIM TO SAY ARE YOU ASLEEP MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN NO PLANCHET I AM NOT EVEN ASLEEP REPLIED THE MUSKETEER
8063-274112-0024 I AM IN DESPAIR SAID PLANCHET TO HEAR SUCH A WORD AS EVEN WELL
8063-274112-0025 OF COURSE MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN WELL WELL THEN THE WORD DISTRESSES ME BEYOND MEASURE TELL ME WHY YOU ARE DISTRESSED PLANCHET SAID D'ARTAGNAN IF YOU SAY THAT YOU ARE NOT EVEN ASLEEP
8063-274112-0026 PLANCHET YOU KNOW THAT I AM NEVER BORED EXCEPT TO DAY AND THE DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY BAH MONSIEUR D'ARTAGNAN IT IS A WEEK SINCE YOU RETURNED HERE FROM FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274112-0027 IN OTHER WORDS YOU HAVE NO LONGER YOUR ORDERS TO ISSUE OR YOUR MEN TO REVIEW AND MANEUVER YOU NEED THE SOUND OF GUNS DRUMS AND ALL THAT DIN AND CONFUSION
8063-274112-0028 WHEN YOU WERE THERE WHEN WE BOTH WERE THERE A CERTAIN ARAB
8063-274112-0029 HE WAS A CLEVER FELLOW ALTHOUGH OF A VERY ODD COMPLEXION WHICH WAS THE SAME COLOR AS YOUR OLIVES WELL THIS ARAB WHENEVER HE HAD DONE EATING OR WORKING USED TO SIT DOWN TO REST HIMSELF
8063-274112-0030 AS I AM RESTING MYSELF NOW AND SMOKED I CANNOT TELL YOU WHAT SORT OF MAGICAL LEAVES IN A LARGE AMBER MOUTHED TUBE
8063-274112-0031 BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP TO LIE DOWN THAN TO SIT DOWN TO BE DEAD THAN TO LIE DOWN HE WAS AN ACUTELY MELANCHOLY ARAB AND I REMEMBER HIM PERFECTLY WELL
8063-274112-0032 HE USED TO CUT OFF THE HEADS OF PROTESTANTS WITH THE MOST SINGULAR GUSTO PRECISELY AND THEN USED TO EMBALM THEM WHEN THEY WERE WORTH THE TROUBLE
8063-274112-0033 HE LOOKED LIKE A BASKET MAKER MAKING BASKETS YOU ARE QUITE RIGHT PLANCHET HE DID
8063-274112-0034 I HAVE NO DOUBT OF IT BUT WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS MODE OF REASONING
8063-274112-0035 IN POINT OF FACT THEN BETTER TO SIT DOWN THAN TO STAND UP IS PLAIN ENOUGH ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE MAY BE FATIGUED AND PLANCHET SMILED IN A ROGUISH WAY AS FOR BETTER TO BE LYING DOWN LET THAT PASS
8063-274112-0036 IT IS IN MY OPINION VERY ABSURD MY OWN UNDOUBTED PREFERENCE BEING FOR MY BED AND IF YOU ARE NOT OF MY OPINION IT IS SIMPLY AS I HAVE ALREADY HAD THE HONOR OF TELLING YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE BORING YOURSELF TO DEATH PLANCHET
8063-274112-0037 EXACTLY WELL THEN I AM LIKE HIS HARE HE HAS GOT A HARE ALSO THEN HE HAS ALL SORTS OF ANIMALS WELL WHAT DOES HIS HARE DO THEN
8063-274112-0038 THINKS AH

8063-274115-0000 WOULD BE ONE OF THE PRIVILEGED TRAVELERS AND AS THE PLUME IN PORTHOS'S HAT MADE THE WOODEN CANDLES SUSPENDED OVER THE FRONT JINGLE TOGETHER
8063-274115-0001 FOR THE MORROW BUT THE GROCER HAD A HEART OF GOLD EVER MINDFUL OF THE GOOD OLD TIMES A TRAIT THAT CARRIES YOUTH INTO OLD AGE SO PLANCHET NOTWITHSTANDING A SORT OF INTERNAL SHIVER CHECKED AS SOON AS EXPERIENCED
8063-274115-0002 RECEIVED PORTHOS WITH RESPECT MINGLED WITH THE TENDEREST CORDIALITY PORTHOS WHO WAS A LITTLE COLD AND STIFF IN HIS MANNERS AT FIRST ON ACCOUNT OF THE SOCIAL DIFFERENCE EXISTING AT THAT PERIOD BETWEEN A BARON AND A GROCER SOON BEGAN TO SOFTEN WHEN HE PERCEIVED SO MUCH GOOD FEELING
8063-274115-0003 AND INTO THE DRAWERS FULL OF SWEETMEATS
8063-274115-0004 WHERE HIS FINGERS COULD ALWAYS FISH UP WHATEVER HIS NOSE DETECTED THE DELICIOUS FIGS FROM PROVENCE FILBERTS FROM THE FOREST TOURS PLUMS WERE SUBJECTS OF HIS UNINTERRUPTED ATTENTION FOR FIVE CONSECUTIVE HOURS HIS TEETH LIKE MILLSTONES CRACKED HEAPS OF NUTS
8063-274115-0005 THE SHELLS OF WHICH WERE SCATTERED ALL OVER THE FLOOR WHERE THEY WERE TRAMPLED BY EVERY ONE WHO WENT IN AND OUT OF THE SHOP PORTHOS PULLED FROM THE STALK WITH HIS LIPS AT ONE MOUTHFUL BUNCHES OF THE RICH MUSCATEL RAISINS WITH THEIR BEAUTIFUL BLOOM
8063-274115-0006 AT EACH OTHER WITHOUT VENTURING TO OPEN THEIR LIPS THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO PORTHOS WAS FOR THEY HAD NEVER SEEN HIM BEFORE
8063-274115-0007 HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO DISAPPEAR
8063-274115-0008 HE WILL VERY SOON HAVE NONE AT ALL TO DO IF THIS SORT OF THING CONTINUES GRUMBLED THE FOREMAN WHO HAD PLANCHET'S WORD THAT HE SHOULD BE HIS SUCCESSOR IN THE MIDST OF HIS DESPAIR
8063-274115-0009 HE APPROACHED PORTHOS WHO BLOCKED UP THE WHOLE OF THE PASSAGE LEADING FROM THE BACK SHOP TO THE SHOP ITSELF HE HOPED THAT PORTHOS WOULD RISE AND THAT THIS MOVEMENT WOULD DISTRACT HIS DEVOURING IDEAS WHAT DO YOU WANT MY MAN ASKED PORTHOS AFFABLY
8063-274115-0010 I SHOULD LIKE TO PASS YOU MONSIEUR IF IT IS NOT TROUBLING YOU TOO MUCH VERY WELL SAID PORTHOS IT DOES NOT TROUBLE ME IN THE LEAST AT THE SAME MOMENT HE TOOK HOLD OF THE YOUNG FELLOW BY THE WAISTBAND LIFTED HIM OFF THE GROUND AND PLACED HIM VERY GENTLY ON THE OTHER SIDE
8063-274115-0011 SMILING ALL THE WHILE WITH THE SAME AFFABLE EXPRESSION AS SOON AS PORTHOS HAD PLACED HIM ON THE GROUND THE LAD'S LEGS SO SHOOK UNDER HIM THAT HE FELL BACK UPON SOME SACKS OF CORKS BUT NOTICING THE GIANT'S GENTLENESS OF MANNER HE VENTURED AGAIN AND SAID
8063-274115-0012 YES BUT IF RAISINS NUTS AND ALMONDS ARE HEATING THERE IS NO DOUBT AT ALL OF IT MONSIEUR HONEY IS VERY COOLING SAID PORTHOS STRETCHING OUT HIS HAND TOWARD A SMALL BARREL OF HONEY WHICH WAS OPEN AND HE PLUNGED THE SCOOP WITH
8063-274115-0013 THE FOREMAN CLASPED HIS HANDS TOGETHER THE TWO OTHERS GOT UNDER THE COUNTERS FEARING PORTHOS MIGHT HAVE A TASTE FOR HUMAN FLESH WE SHALL ONLY TAKE A SORT OF SNACK HERE SAID D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274115-0014 SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU OVERWHELM ME MONSIEUR LE BARON THE MONSIEUR LE BARON HAD A GREAT EFFECT UPON THE MEN WHO DETECTED A PERSONAGE OF THE HIGHEST QUALITY IN AN APPETITE OF THAT KIND THIS TITLE TOO REASSURED THEM
8063-274115-0015 THEY HAD NEVER HEARD THAT AN OGRE WAS EVER CALLED MONSIEUR LE BARON I WILL TAKE A FEW BISCUITS TO EAT ON THE ROAD SAID PORTHOS CARELESSLY AND HE EMPTIED A WHOLE JAR OF ANISEED BISCUITS INTO THE HUGE POCKET OF HIS DOUBLET
8063-274115-0016 MY SHOP IS SAVED EXCLAIMED PLANCHET YES AS THE CHEESE WAS WHISPERED THE FOREMAN WHAT CHEESE THE DUTCH CHEESE INSIDE WHICH A RAT HAD MADE HIS WAY AND WE FOUND ONLY THE RIND LEFT
8063-274115-0017 WHERE IT HAD JUST BEEN ANNOUNCED THAT SOME REFRESHMENT WAS PREPARED ALAS THOUGHT THE GROCER ADDRESSING A LOOK AT D'ARTAGNAN FULL OF ENTREATY WHICH THE LATTER HALF UNDERSTOOD AS SOON AS THEY HAD FINISHED EATING THEY SET OFF IT WAS LATE
8063-274115-0018 WHEN THE THREE RIDERS WHO HAD LEFT PARIS ABOUT SIX IN THE EVENING ARRIVED AT FONTAINEBLEAU
8063-274115-0019 AND SEEMED DELIGHTED TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT HIS MEADOWS HIS WOODS AND HIS RABBIT WARRENS PORTHOS HAD ALL THE TASTE AND PRIDE OF A LANDED PROPRIETOR WHEN D'ARTAGNAN SAW HIS TWO COMPANIONS IN EARNEST CONVERSATION
8063-274115-0020 SEPARATED HIMSELF FROM THE WHOLE WORLD AS HE HAD DONE FROM PORTHOS AND FROM PLANCHET THE MOON SHONE SOFTLY THROUGH THE FOLIAGE OF THE FOREST THE BREEZES OF THE OPEN COUNTRY ROSE DELICIOUSLY PERFUMED TO THE HORSE'S NOSTRILS AND THEY SNORTED AND PRANCED ALONG DELIGHTEDLY
8063-274115-0021 IN THE BEAUTIFUL MEADOWS WHERE THE GRASS GREW AS HIGH AS THE KNEES AND WHERE HE HAD PLAYED UNDER THE GREEN APPLE TREES COVERED WITH RED CHEEKED FRUIT HE WENT ON TO SAY THAT HE HAD SOLEMNLY PROMISED HIMSELF THAT AS SOON AS HE SHOULD HAVE MADE HIS FORTUNE HE WOULD RETURN TO NATURE
8063-274115-0022 HOW SO WHY YOU SEEM TO BE IN THE WAY OF MAKING YOUR FORTUNE VERY SOON
8063-274115-0023 WHAT IS IT INQUIRED PORTHOS LOOKING ALL ROUND HIM AS IF IN SEARCH OF THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT ANNOYED PLANCHET AND DESIROUS OF FREEING HIM FROM IT WHY FORMERLY SAID THE GROCER YOU USED TO CALL ME PLANCHET QUITE SHORT
8063-274115-0024 AND YOU WOULD HAVE SPOKEN TO ME THEN IN A MUCH MORE FAMILIAR MANNER THAN YOU DO NOW CERTAINLY CERTAINLY I SHOULD HAVE SAID SO FORMERLY REPLIED THE GOOD NATURED PORTHOS WITH AN EMBARRASSMENT FULL OF DELICACY BUT FORMERLY
8063-274115-0025 SO THAT MONSIEUR LE BARON CONTINUED THE GROCER
8063-274115-0026 IF THAT BE THE CASE MY DEAR PLANCHET I WILL DO SO CERTAINLY REPLIED PORTHOS AND
8063-274115-0027 BUT A FORTUNATE MOVEMENT OF THE HORSE MADE HIM MISS HIS AIM
8063-274115-0028 WHICH MADE THE ANIMAL'S LEGS ALMOST GIVE WAY D'ARTAGNAN BURST OUT LAUGHING AS HE SAID TAKE CARE PLANCHET

8063-274115-0034 NEARLY AS BEAUTIFUL AS MY FOREST AT BERRY PLANCHET OPENED HIS EYES VERY WIDE
8063-274115-0035 BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT ENDS AND ALSO BECAUSE IT IS FULL OF POACHERS HOW CAN THE POACHERS MAKE THE FOREST SO AGREEABLE TO YOU BECAUSE THEY HUNT MY GAME AND I HUNT THEM
8063-274115-0036 WHICH IN THESE PEACEFUL TIMES IS FOR ME A SUFFICIENTLY PLEASING PICTURE OF WAR ON A SMALL SCALE
8063-274116-0000 THE CAVALIERS LOOKED UP AND SAW THAT WHAT PLANCHET HAD ANNOUNCED TO THEM WAS TRUE TEN MINUTES AFTERWARDS THEY WERE IN THE STREET CALLED THE RUE DE LYON ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE HOSTELRY OF THE BEAU PAON A HIGH HEDGE OF BUSHY ELDERS
8063-274116-0001 HAWTHORN AND WILD HOPS FORMED AN IMPENETRABLE FENCE BEHIND WHICH ROSE A WHITE HOUSE WITH A HIGH TILED ROOF
8063-274116-0002 BETWEEN THE TWO A SMALL DOOR WITH A PORCH SUPPORTED BY A COUPLE OF PILLARS FORMED THE ENTRANCE TO THE HOUSE THE DOOR WAS GAINED BY A STEP RAISED A LITTLE FROM THE GROUND
8063-274116-0003 ON SECOND THOUGHTS HE TOOK HOLD OF HIS HORSE BY THE BRIDLE AND LED IT ABOUT THIRTY PACES FURTHER ON HIS TWO COMPANIONS FOLLOWING HIM HE THEN ADVANCED ABOUT ANOTHER THIRTY PACES UNTIL HE ARRIVED AT THE DOOR OF A CART HOUSE LIGHTED BY AN IRON GRATING AND LIFTING UP A WOODEN LATCH PUSHED OPEN ONE OF THE FOLDING DOORS
8063-274116-0004 HE ENTERED FIRST LEADING HIS HORSE AFTER HIM BY THE BRIDLE INTO A SMALL COURTYARD WHERE AN ODOR MET THEM WHICH REVEALED THEIR CLOSE VICINITY TO A STABLE THAT SMELLS ALL RIGHT SAID PORTHOS LOUDLY GETTING OFF HIS HORSE AND I ALMOST BEGIN TO THINK

8063-274116-0010 AND CAME OUT INTO A LITTLE GARDEN BEHIND THE HOUSE THE PRINCIPAL FRONT OF WHICH AS WE HAVE ALREADY NOTICED FACED THE STREET AS THEY APPROACHED
8063-274116-0011 THIS ROOM SOFTLY LIGHTED BY A LAMP PLACED ON THE TABLE SEEMED FROM THE END OF THE GARDEN LIKE A SMILING IMAGE OF REPOSE COMFORT AND HAPPINESS IN EVERY DIRECTION WHERE THE RAYS OF LIGHT FELL
8063-274116-0012 WHETHER UPON A PIECE OF OLD CHINA OR UPON AN ARTICLE OF FURNITURE SHINING FROM EXCESSIVE NEATNESS OR UPON THE WEAPONS HANGING AGAINST THE WALL THE SOFT LIGHT WAS SOFTLY REFLECTED AND ITS RAYS SEEMED TO LINGER EVERYWHERE UPON SOMETHING OR ANOTHER AGREEABLE TO THE EYE THE LAMP WHICH LIGHTED THE ROOM
8063-274116-0013 WHILST THE FOLIAGE OF JASMINE AND CLIMBING ROSES HUNG IN MASSES FROM THE WINDOW FRAMES SPLENDIDLY ILLUMINATED A DAMASK TABLE CLOTH AS WHITE AS SNOW THE TABLE WAS LAID FOR TWO PERSONS AMBER COLORED WINE SPARKLED IN A LONG CUT GLASS BOTTLE
8063-274116-0014 NEAR THE TABLE IN A HIGH BACKED ARMCHAIR RECLINED FAST ASLEEP A WOMAN OF ABOUT THIRTY YEARS OF AGE HER FACE THE VERY PICTURE OF HEALTH AND FRESHNESS UPON HER KNEES LAY A LARGE CAT WITH HER PAWS FOLDED UNDER HER
8063-274116-0015 AND HER EYES HALF CLOSED PURRING IN THAT SIGNIFICANT MANNER WHICH ACCORDING TO FELINE HABITS INDICATES PERFECT CONTENTMENT
8063-274116-0016 AT THE SOUND OF THIS GIGANTIC VOICE THE CAT TOOK FLIGHT

8063-274116-0025 AND A VERY PRETTY NAME TOO SAID PORTHOS
8063-274116-0026 SHE RAN AWAY FROM A BRUTE OF A HUSBAND WHO WAS IN THE HABIT OF BEATING HER BEING MYSELF A PICARD BORN I WAS ALWAYS VERY FOND OF THE ARTESIAN WOMEN AND IT IS ONLY A STEP FROM ARTOIS TO FLANDERS

8063-274116-0032 D'ARTAGNAN STILL PRESERVED HIS DIGNITY AND SELF POSSESSION BUT PORTHOS HAD LOST A PORTION OF HIS AND THE MIRTH SOON BEGAN TO GROW SOMEWHAT UPROARIOUS D'ARTAGNAN
8063-274116-0033 RECOMMENDED A NEW DESCENT INTO THE CELLAR AND AS PLANCHET NO LONGER WALKED WITH THE STEADINESS OF A WELL TRAINED FOOT SOLDIER
8063-274116-0034 THEY SET OFF HUMMING SONGS WILD ENOUGH TO FRIGHTEN ANYBODY WHO MIGHT BE LISTENING
8063-274116-0035 WHILE THE TWO WINE BIBBERS
8063-274116-0036 PORTHOS FANCIES HIMSELF AT LA ROCHELLE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN AS THEY RETURNED FREIGHTED WITH BOTTLES

8063-274116-0038 AND TRUCHEN WAS LOOKING AT HIM WITH A MOST BEWITCHING SMILE THE SPARKLING WINE OF ANJOU VERY SOON PRODUCED A REMARKABLE EFFECT UPON THE THREE COMPANIONS
8063-274116-0039 AFTER HIS FRIEND HAD UNDRESSED HIM D'ARTAGNAN GOT INTO HIS OWN BED SAYING TO HIMSELF MORDIOUX
8063-274116-0040 NO ONE IN THE HOUSE WAS CAPABLE OF TAKING THE SLIGHTEST NOTICE

8063-274117-0025 THE TWO BEARERS OF THE CORPSE HAD UNFASTENED THE STRAPS BY WHICH THEY CARRIED THE LITTER AND WERE LETTING THEIR BURDEN GLIDE GENTLY INTO THE OPEN GRAVE
8063-274117-0026 THE GRAVE HAVING BEEN FILLED UP THE PRIESTS TURNED AWAY AND THE GRAVE DIGGER HAVING ADDRESSED A FEW WORDS TO THEM FOLLOWED THEM AS THEY MOVED AWAY
8063-274117-0027 IT IS ARAMIS HIMSELF ARAMIS IN FACT REMAINED ALONE ON THAT SIDE AT LEAST FOR HARDLY HAD HE TURNED HIS HEAD WHEN A WOMAN'S FOOTSTEPS AND THE RUSTLING OF HER DRESS WERE HEARD IN THE PATH CLOSE TO HIM HE IMMEDIATELY TURNED ROUND
8063-274117-0028 YES HE ADDED AFTER A PAUSE
8063-274117-0029 EITHER BY WAY OF ATTACK OR DEFENSE THAT THEY MUST BE CONVERSING ABOUT ANY OTHER SUBJECT THAN OF LOVE AT THE END OF THE CONVERSATION THE LADY ROSE AND BOWED PROFOUNDLY TO ARAMIS
8063-274117-0030 THE CAVALIER KNEELS AT THE BEGINNING THE YOUNG LADY BY AND BY GETS TAMED DOWN AND THEN IT IS SHE WHO HAS TO SUPPLICATE WHO IS THIS LADY I WOULD GIVE ANYTHING TO ASCERTAIN THIS SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE HOWEVER FOR ARAMIS WAS THE FIRST TO LEAVE
8063-274117-0031 I MUST AND WILL LEARN WHO THAT WOMAN IS SAID THE MUSKETEER AGAIN AND THEN WITHOUT FURTHER DELIBERATION HE SET OFF IN PURSUIT OF HER AS HE WAS GOING ALONG HE TRIED TO THINK HOW HE COULD POSSIBLY CONTRIVE TO MAKE HER RAISE HER VEIL SHE IS NOT YOUNG HE SAID
8063-274117-0032 AND IS A WOMAN OF HIGH RANK IN SOCIETY I OUGHT TO KNOW THAT FIGURE AND PECULIAR STYLE OF WALK AS HE RAN THE SOUND OF HIS SPURS AND OF HIS BOOTS UPON THE HARD GROUND OF THE STREET MADE A STRANGE JINGLING NOISE A FORTUNATE CIRCUMSTANCE IN ITSELF
8063-274117-0033 WHICH HE WAS FAR FROM RECKONING UPON THE NOISE DISTURBED THE LADY SHE SEEMED TO FANCY SHE WAS BEING EITHER FOLLOWED OR PURSUED WHICH WAS INDEED THE CASE AND TURNED ROUND
8063-274117-0034 HE MURMURED MADAME DE CHEVREUSE D'ARTAGNAN WOULD NOT GO HOME UNTIL HE HAD LEARNT EVERYTHING
8063-274117-0035 A POOR FRANCISCAN MENDICANT FRIAR REPLIED THE LATTER WHO HAD NOT EVEN A DOG TO LOVE HIM IN THIS WORLD AND TO ACCOMPANY HIM TO HIS LAST RESTING PLACE IF THAT WERE REALLY THE CASE THOUGHT D'ARTAGNAN
8088-284756-0000 FROM SOMEWHERE OUT ON THE BLACK HEAVING ATLANTIC THE RAPID MUFFLED POPPING OF A SPEED BOAT'S EXHAUST DRIFTED CLEARLY THROUGH THE NIGHT
8088-284756-0001 THERE WAS REAL ROMANCE AND ADVENTURE RUM RUNNERS SEEKING OUT THEIR HIDDEN PORT WITH THEIR CARGO OF CONTRABAND FROM CUBA HEADING FEARLESSLY THROUGH THE DARKNESS FIGHTING THE HIGH SEAS STILL RUNNING AFTER THE STORM OF A DAY OR SO BEFORE
8088-284756-0002 DARING A THOUSAND DANGERS FOR THE SAKE OF THE STRAW PACKED BOTTLES THEY CARRIED SEA BRONZED MEN WITH HARD FLAT MUSCLES AND FEARLESS EYES READY GUNS SLAPPING THEIR THIGHS AS THEY
8088-284756-0003 ABSORBED IN MY MENTAL PICTURE OF THESE MODERN FREE BOOTERS THE SUDDEN ALARM OF THE TELEPHONE STARTLED ME LIKE AN UNEXPECTED SHOT FIRED BESIDE MY EAR BRUSHING THE CIGARETTE ASHES FROM MY SMOKING JACKET I CROSSED THE ROOM AND SNATCHED UP THE RECEIVER
8088-284756-0004 HELLO I SNAPPED UNGRACIOUSLY INTO THE MOUTHPIECE IT WAS AFTER ELEVEN BY THE SHIP'S CLOCK ON THE MANTEL AND IF TAYLOR THE VOICE WARREN MERCER'S FAMILIAR VOICE
8088-284756-0005 GET IN YOUR CAR AND COME DOWN HERE AS FAST AS POSSIBLE COME JUST AS YOU ARE AND WHAT'S THE MATTER I MANAGED TO INTERRUPT HIM BURGLARS
8088-284756-0006 I HAD NEVER HEARD MERCER SPEAK IN THAT HIGH PITCHED EXCITED VOICE BEFORE HIS USUAL SPEECH WAS SLOW AND THOUGHTFUL ALMOST DIDACTIC
8088-284756-0007 IF IT WEREN'T URGENT I WOULDN'T BE CALLING YOU YOU KNOW WILL YOU COME YOU BET I SAID QUICKLY FEELING RATHER A FOOL FOR RAGGING HIM WHEN HE WAS IN SUCH DEADLY EARNEST HAVE THE RECEIVER SNAPPED AND CRACKLED
8088-284756-0008 USUALLY THE VERY SOUL OF COURTESY AND CONSIDERATION
8088-284756-0009 A MOMENT LATER I WAS OFF THE GRAVELLED DRIVE AND TEARING DOWN THE CONCRETE WITH THE ACCELERATOR ALL THE WAY DOWN AND THE BLACK WIND SHRIEKING AROUND THE WINDSHIELD OF MY LITTLE ROADSTER MY OWN SHACK WAS OUT OF THE CITY LIMITS
8088-284756-0010 MERCER PICKED THE PLACE UP FOR ME AT A SONG THE MONSTROSITY WAS SOME FOUR MILES FURTHER OUT FROM TOWN AND OFF THE HIGHWAY PERHAPS A HALF MILE MORE
8088-284756-0011 I MADE THE FOUR MILES IN JUST A SHADE OVER THAT MANY MINUTES AND CLAMPED ON THE BRAKES AS I SAW THE ENTRANCE TO THE LITTLE DRIVE THAT LED TOWARD THE SEA AND MERCER'S ESTATE
8088-284756-0012 WITH GRAVEL RATTLING ON MY FENDERS I TURNED OFF THE CONCRETE AND SWEPT BETWEEN THE TWO MASSIVE STUCCOED PILLARS THAT GUARDED THE DRIVE BOTH OF THEM BORE CORRODED BRONZE PLATES THE BILLOWS THE NAME GIVEN THE MONSTROSITY BY THE ORIGINAL OWNER
8088-284756-0013 A NEWLY RICH MUNITIONS MANUFACTURER THE STRUCTURE ITSELF LOOMED UP BEFORE ME IN A FEW SECONDS A RAMBLING AFFAIR WITH SQUARE SHOULDERED BALCONIES AND A GREAT DEAL OF WROUGHT IRON WORK AFTER THE MOST FLAMBOYANT SPANISH PATTERN IT WAS ABLAZE WITH LIGHT
8088-284756-0014 APPARENTLY EVERY BULB IN THE PLACE WAS BURNING JUST A FEW YARDS BEYOND THE SURF BOOMED HOLLOWLY ON THE SMOOTH SHADY SHORE LITTERED NOW I KNEW BY THE PITIFUL SPOILS OF THE STORM
8088-284756-0015 AS I CLAMPED ON MY BRAKES A SWIFT SHADOW PASSED TWO OF THE LOWER WINDOWS BEFORE I COULD LEAP FROM THE CAR THE BROAD FRONT DOOR WITH ITS ROUNDED TOP AND CIRCULAR GRILLED WINDOW WAS FLUNG WIDE AND MERCER CAME RUNNING TO MEET ME
8088-284756-0016 HE WAS WEARING A BATHROBE HASTILY FLUNG ON OVER A DAMP BATHING SUIT HIS BARE LEGS TERMINATING IN A PAIR OF DISREPUTABLE SLIPPERS FINE TAYLOR HE GREETED ME I SUPPOSE YOU'RE WONDERING WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT I DON'T BLAME YOU BUT COME IN COME IN
8088-284756-0017 JUST WAIT TILL YOU SEE HER HER I ASKED STARTLED
8088-284756-0018 MERCER HE LAUGHED EXCITEDLY YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL SEE NO I'M NOT IN LOVE AND I WANT YOU TO HELP AND NOT ADMIRE THERE ARE ONLY CARSON AND MYSELF HERE YOU KNOW AND THE JOB'S TOO BIG FOR THE TWO OF US
8088-284756-0019 HE HURRIED ME ACROSS THE BROAD CONCRETE PORCH AND INTO THE HOUSE THROW THE CAP ANYWHERE AND COME ON TOO MUCH AMAZED TO COMMENT FURTHER I FOLLOWED MY FRIEND THIS WAS A WARREN MERCER I DID NOT KNOW
8088-284756-0020 HIS EYES DARK AND LARGE SMILED EASILY AND SHONE WITH INTEREST BUT HIS ALMOST BEAUTIFUL MOUTH BENEATH THE LONG SLIM MUSTACHE ALWAYS CLOSELY CROPPED SELDOM SMILED WITH HIS EYES BUT IT WAS HIS PRESENT EXCITED SPEECH THAT AMAZED ME MOST
8088-284756-0021 MERCER DURING ALL THE YEARS I HAD KNOWN HIM HAD NEVER BEEN MOVED BEFORE TO SUCH TEMPESTUOUS OUTBURSTS OF ENTHUSIASM IT WAS HIS HABIT TO SPEAK SLOWLY AND THOUGHTFULLY IN HIS LOW MUSICAL VOICE EVEN IN THE MIDST OF OUR HOTTEST ARGUMENTS AND WE HAD HAD MANY OF THEM
8088-284756-0022 THE OTHER END OF THE ROOM WAS NEARLY ALL GLASS AND OPENED ONTO THE PATIO AND THE SWIMMING POOL MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT WITH HIS HAND ON THE KNOB OF THE DOOR A STRANGE LIGHT IN HIS DARK EYES NOW YOU'LL SEE WHY I CALLED YOU HERE HE SAID TENSELY
8088-284756-0023 YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF WHETHER THE TRIP WAS WORTH WHILE HERE SHE IS WITH A GESTURE HE FLUNG OPEN THE DOOR AND I STARED FOLLOWING HIS GLANCE DOWN AT THE GREAT TILED SWIMMING POOL IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO DESCRIBE THE SCENE
8088-284756-0024 THE PATIO WAS NOT LARGE BUT IT WAS BEAUTIFULLY DONE FLOWERS AND SHRUBS EVEN A FEW SMALL PALMS GREW IN PROFUSION IN THE ENCLOSURE WHILE ABOVE THROUGH THE MOVABLE GLASS ROOF MADE IN SECTIONS TO DISAPPEAR IN FINE WEATHER
8088-284756-0025 WAS THE EMPTY BLACKNESS OF THE SKY NONE OF THE LIGHTS PROVIDED FOR THE ILLUMINATION OF THE COVERED PATIO WAS TURNED ON BUT ALL THE WINDOWS SURROUNDING THE PATIO WERE AGLOW AND I COULD SEE THE POOL QUITE CLEARLY THE POOL AND ITS OCCUPANT
8088-284756-0026 WE WERE STANDING AT ONE SIDE OF THE POOL NEAR THE CENTER DIRECTLY OPPOSITE US SEATED ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL WAS A HUMAN FIGURE NUDE SAVE FOR A GREAT MASS OF TAWNY HAIR THAT FELL ABOUT HER LIKE A SILKEN MANTLE
8088-284756-0027 EVEN IN THE SOFT LIGHT I COULD SEE HER PERFECTLY THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER HER PALE BODY OUTLINED SHARPLY AGAINST THE JADE GREEN TILES I TORE MYSELF AWAY FROM THE STARING CURIOUS EYES OF THE FIGURE IN GOD'S NAME MERCER WHAT IS IT
8088-284756-0028 PORCELAIN I ASKED HOARSELY THE THING HAD AN INDESCRIBABLY EERY EFFECT HE LAUGHED WILDLY PORCELAIN WATCH LOOK MY EYES FOLLOWED HIS POINTING FINGER
8088-284756-0029 THE GREAT CLOUD OF CORN COLORED HAIR FLOATED DOWN ABOUT IT FALLING BELOW THE KNEES SLOWLY WITH A GRACE OF MOVEMENT COMPARABLE ONLY WITH THE SLOW SOARING OF A GULL SHE CAME TOWARD ME WALKING ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER AS THOUGH SHE FLOATED IN AIR
8088-284756-0030 FASCINATED I WATCHED HER HER EYES STARTLINGLY LARGE AND DARK IN THE STRANGELY WHITE FACE WERE FIXED ON MINE THERE WAS NOTHING SINISTER IN THE GAZE YET I FELT MY BODY SHAKING AS THOUGH IN THE GRIP OF A TERRIBLE FEAR
8088-284756-0031 I TRIED TO LOOK AWAY AND FOUND MYSELF UNABLE TO MOVE I FELT MERCER'S TENSE SUDDEN GRIP UPON MY ARM BUT I DID NOT COULD NOT LOOK AT HIM SHE SHE'S SMILING I HEARD HIM EXCLAIM
8088-284756-0032 HE LAUGHED AN EXCITED HIGH PITCHED LAUGH THAT IRRITATED ME IN SOME SUBTLE WAY SHE WAS SMILING AND LOOKING UP INTO MY EYES SHE WAS VERY CLOSE NOW WITHIN A FEW FEET OF US
8088-284756-0033 AND HER BOSOM RISING AND FALLING BENEATH THE VEIL OF PALE GOLD HAIR SHE WAS BREATHING WATER MERCER LITERALLY JERKED ME AWAY FROM THE EDGE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0034 HE ASKED HIS DARK EYES DANCING WITH EXCITEMENT TELL ME ABOUT IT I SAID SHAKING MY HEAD DAZEDLY SHE IS NOT HUMAN I DON'T KNOW I THINK SO AS HUMAN AS YOU OR I I'LL TELL YOU ALL I KNOW AND THEN YOU CAN JUDGE FOR YOURSELF
8088-284756-0035 I THINK WE'LL KNOW IN A FEW MINUTES IF MY PLANS WORK OUT BUT FIRST SLIP ON A BATHING SUIT I DIDN'T ARGUE THE MATTER I LET MERCER LEAD ME AWAY WITHOUT A WORD AND WHILE I WAS CHANGING HE TOLD ME ALL HE KNEW OF THE STRANGE CREATURE IN THE POOL
8088-284756-0036 LATE THIS AFTERNOON I DECIDED TO GO FOR A LITTLE WALK ALONG THE BEACH MERCER BEGAN I HAD BEEN WORKING LIKE THE DEVIL SINCE EARLY IN THE MORNING RUNNING SOME TESTS ON WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH I FELT THE NEED OF SOME FRESH SEA AIR
8088-284756-0037 I WALKED ALONG BRISKLY FOR PERHAPS FIVE MINUTES
8088-284756-0038 THE SHORE WAS LITTERED WITH ALL SORTS OF FLOTSAM AND JETSAM WASHED UP BY THE BIG STORM AND I WAS JUST THINKING THAT I WOULD HAVE TO HAVE A MAN WITH A TRUCK COME AND CLEAN UP THE SHORE IN FRONT OF THE PLACE WHEN IN A LITTLE SANDY POOL I SAW HER
8088-284756-0039 SHE WAS LAYING FACE DOWN IN THE WATER MOTIONLESS HER HEAD TOWARDS THE SEA ONE ARM STRETCHED OUT BEFORE HER AND HER LONG HAIR WRAPPED AROUND HER LIKE A HALF TRANSPARENT CLOAK I RAN UP AND LIFTED HER FROM THE WATER HER BODY WAS COLD AND DEATHLY WHITE
8088-284756-0040 AND TOOK THE LIQUOR IN A SINGLE DRAUGHT SHE DID NOT SEEM TO DRINK IT BUT SUCKED IT OUT OF THE GLASS IN A SINGLE AMAZING GULP THAT'S THE ONLY WORD FOR IT
8088-284756-0041 WEBBED I ASKED STARTLED WEBBED NODDED MERCER SOLEMNLY AS ARE HER FEET BUT LISTEN TAYLOR I WAS AMAZED AND NOT A LITTLE RATTLED WHEN SHE CAME FOR ME
8088-284756-0042 I RAN THROUGH THE FRENCH WINDOWS OUT INTO THE PATIO FOR A MOMENT SHE RAN AFTER ME RATHER AWKWARDLY AND HEAVILY BUT SWIFTLY NEVERTHELESS THEN SHE SAW THE POOL APPARENTLY FORGETTING THAT I EXISTED SHE LEAPED INTO THE WATER
8088-284756-0043 I REMINDED HIM AS HE PAUSED APPARENTLY LOST IN THOUGHT I TRIED TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT HER I PUT ON MY BATHING SUIT AND DIVED INTO THE POOL WELL SHE CAME AT ME LIKE A SHARK QUICK AS A FLASH HER TEETH SHOWING HER HANDS TEARING LIKE CLAWS THROUGH THE WATER
8088-284756-0044 SHE MANAGED TO CLAW ME JUST ONCE MERCER RESUMED WRAPPING THE ROBE ABOUT HIM AGAIN THEN I GOT OUT AND CALLED ON CARSON FOR HELP I PUT HIM INTO A BATHING SUIT AND WE BOTH ENDEAVORED TO CORNER HER
8088-284756-0045 CARSON GOT TWO BAD SCRATCHES AND ONE RATHER SERIOUS BITE THAT I HAVE BANDAGED I HAVE A NUMBER OF LACERATIONS BUT I DIDN'T FARE SO BADLY AS CARSON BECAUSE I AM FASTER IN THE WATER THAN HE IS THE HARDER WE TRIED THE MORE DETERMINED I BECAME
8088-284756-0046 WE MOVED OUT OF THE ROOM NOTHING HUMAN CAN LIVE UNDER WATER AND BREATHE WATER AS SHE DOES MERCER PAUSED A MOMENT STARING AT ME ODDLY THE HUMAN RACE HE SAID GRAVELY CAME UP OUT OF SEA THE HUMAN RACE AS WE KNOW IT SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK
8088-284756-0047 MERCER SOME MAY HAVE GONE BACK I DON'T GET IT MERCER SHOOK HIS HEAD BUT MADE NO OTHER REPLY UNTIL WE STOOD AGAIN ON THE EDGE OF THE POOL THE GIRL WAS STANDING WHERE WE HAD LEFT HER AND AS SHE LOOKED UP INTO MY FACE SHE SMILED AGAIN
8088-284756-0048 AND IN THAT WHITE BATHING SUIT YES I BELIEVE SHE'S TAKEN A FANCY TO YOU MERCER'S EYES WERE DANCING IF SHE HAS HE WENT ON IT'LL MAKE OUR WORK VERY EASY WHAT WORK I ASKED SUSPICIOUSLY
8088-284756-0049 I THINK I HAVE WHAT YOU CALL MY THOUGHT TELEGRAPH PERFECTED EXPERIMENTALLY HE EXPLAINED RAPIDLY I FELL ASLEEP WORKING ON IT AT THREE O'CLOCK OR THEREABOUTS THIS MORNING AND SOME TESTS WITH CARSON SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT IS A SUCCESS
8088-284756-0050 I SHOULD HAVE CALLED YOU TO MORROW FOR FURTHER TEST NEARLY FIVE YEARS OF DAMNED HARD WORK TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION TAYLOR
8088-284756-0051 I ASKED EAGERLY GLANCING DOWN AT THE BEAUTIFUL PALE FACE THAT GLIMMERED UP AT ME THROUGH THE CLEAR WATER OF THE POOL WHY TRY IT ON HER EXCLAIMED MERCER WITH MOUNTING ENTHUSIASM DON'T YOU SEE TAYLOR
8088-284756-0052 IF IT WILL WORK ON HER AND WE CAN DIRECT HER THOUGHTS WE CAN FIND OUT HER HISTORY THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE WE'LL ADD A PAGE TO SCIENTIFIC HISTORY A WHOLE BIG CHAPTER THAT WILL MAKE US FAMOUS MAN THIS IS SO BIG IT'S SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET
8088-284756-0053 LOOK AND HE HELD OUT A THIN ARISTOCRATIC BROWN HAND BEFORE MY EYES A HAND THAT SHOOK WITH NERVOUS EXCITEMENT I DON'T BLAME YOU I SAID QUICKLY
8088-284756-0054 LET'S GET BUSY WHAT CAN I DO MERCER REACHED AROUND THE DOOR INTO THE LABORATORY AND PRESSED A BUTTON FOR CARSON HE EXPLAINED WE'LL NEED HIS HELP IN THE MEANTIME WE'LL LOOK OVER THE SET UP THE APPARATUS IS STREWN ALL OVER THE PLACE
8088-284756-0055 HE HAD NOT EXAGGERATED THE SET UP CONSISTED OF A WHOLE BANK OF TUBES EACH ONE IN ITS OWN SHIELDING COPPER BOX ON A MUCH DRILLED HORIZONTAL PANEL PROPPED UP ON INSULATORS WERE HALF A SCORE OF DELICATE METERS OF ONE KIND AND ANOTHER
8088-284756-0056 WITH THIN BLACK FINGERS THAT PULSED AND TREMBLED BEHIND THE PANEL WAS A TALL CYLINDER WOUND WITH SHINING COPPER WIRE AND BESIDE IT ANOTHER PANEL UPRIGHT FAIRLY BRISTLING WITH KNOBS CONTACT POINTS POTENTIOMETERS RHEOSTATS AND SWITCHES
8088-284756-0057 AND IN THE CENTER A SWITCH WITH FOUR CONTACT POINTS A HEAVY SNAKY CABLE LED FROM THIS PANEL TO THE MAZE OF APPARATUS FURTHER ON THIS IS THE CONTROL PANEL EXPLAINED MERCER THE WHOLE AFFAIR YOU UNDERSTAND IS IN LABORATORY FORM
8088-284756-0058 NOTHING ASSEMBLED PUT THE DIFFERENT ANTENNAE PLUG INTO THESE JACKS LIKE THIS HE PICKED UP A WEIRD HASTILY BUILT CONTRIVANCE COMPOSED OF TWO SEMI CIRCULAR PIECES OF SPRING BRASS CROSSED AT RIGHT ANGLES
8088-284756-0059 ON ALL FOUR ENDS WERE BRIGHT SILVERY ELECTRODES THREE OF THEM CIRCULAR IN SHAPE ONE OF THEM ELONGATED AND SLIGHTLY CURVED WITH A QUICK NERVOUS GESTURE MERCER FITTED THE THING TO HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0060 SO THAT THE ELONGATED ELECTRODE PRESSED AGAINST THE BACK OF HIS NECK EXTENDING A FEW INCHES DOWN HIS SPINE THE OTHER THREE CIRCULAR ELECTRODES RESTED ON HIS FOREHEAD AND EITHER SIDE OF HIS HEAD
8088-284756-0061 SOME TEN FEET IN LENGTH ENDING IN A SIMPLE SWITCHBOARD PLUG WHICH MERCER FITTED INTO THE UPPERMOST OF THE THREE JACKS NOW HE DIRECTED YOU PUT ON THIS ONE
8088-284756-0062 HE ADJUSTED A SECOND CONTRIVANCE UPON MY HEAD SMILING AS I SHRANK FROM THE CONTACT OF THE COLD METAL ON MY SKIN AND THINK HE MOVED THE SWITCH FROM THE POSITION MARKED OFF TO THE SECOND CONTACT POINT WATCHING ME INTENTLY HIS DARK EYES GLEAMING
8088-284756-0063 VERY NICE OLD CHAP CARSON IMPRESSIVE EVEN IN HIS BATHING SUIT MERCER WAS MIGHTY LUCKY TO HAVE A MAN LIKE CARSON SOMETHING SEEMED TO TICK SUDDENLY SOMEWHERE DEEP IN MY CONSCIOUSNESS YES THAT'S VERY TRUE
8088-284756-0064 THE WORDS WERE NOT SPOKEN I DID NOT HEAR THEM I KNEW THEM WHAT I GLANCED AT MERCER AND HE LAUGHED ALOUD WITH PLEASURE AND EXCITEMENT IT WORKED HE CRIED
8088-284756-0065 I RECEIVED YOUR THOUGHT REGARDING CARSON AND THEN TURNED THE SWITCH SO THAT YOU RECEIVED MY THOUGHT AND YOU DID RATHER GINGERLY I REMOVED THE THING FROM MY HEAD AND LAID IT ON THE TABLE IT'S WIZARDRY MERCER IF IT WILL WORK AS WELL ON HER IT WILL I KNOW IT WILL
8088-284756-0066 IF WE CAN GET HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE REPLIED MERCER CONFIDENTLY I HAVE ONLY THREE OF THEM I HAD PLANNED SOME THREE CORNERED EXPERIMENTS WITH YOU CARSON AND MYSELF WE'LL LEAVE CARSON OUT OF TO NIGHT'S EXPERIMENT HOWEVER FOR WE'LL NEED HIM TO OPERATE THIS SWITCH
8088-284756-0067 THE OTHER TWO RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON THE FIRST CONTACT NUMBER ONE SENDS AND NUMBERS TWO AND THREE RECEIVE WHEN THE SWITCH IS ON NUMBER TWO THEN HE SENDS THOUGHTS AND NUMBERS ONE AND THREE RECEIVE THEM AND SO ON
8088-284756-0068 I'LL LENGTHEN THESE LEADS SO THAT WE CAN RUN THEM OUT INTO THE POOL AND THEN WE'LL BE READY SOMEHOW WE MUST INDUCE HER TO WEAR ONE OF THESE THINGS EVEN IF WE HAVE TO USE FORCE I'M SURE THE THREE OF US CAN HANDLE HER WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO I SMILED
8088-284756-0069 SHE WAS SUCH A SLIM GRACEFUL ALMOST DELICATE LITTLE THING THE THOUGHT THAT THREE STRONG MEN MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO CONTROL HER SEEMED ALMOST AMUSING YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN ACTION YET SAID MERCER GRIMLY
8088-284756-0070 THEN WITH ALL THREE OF THE DEVICES HE CALLED ANTENNAE IN HIS HAND THEIR LEADS PLUGGED INTO THE CONTROL PANEL HE LED THE WAY TO THE SIDE OF THE POOL
8088-284756-0071 IT WAS THE FIRST TIME I HAD SEEN HER MOVE IN THIS FASHION SHE SEEMED TO PROPEL HERSELF WITH A SUDDEN MIGHTY THRUST OF HER FEET AGAINST THE BOTTOM SHE DARTED THROUGH THE WATER WITH THE SPEED OF AN ARROW YET STOPPED AS GENTLY AS THOUGH SHE HAD MERELY FLOATED THERE
8088-284756-0072 AS SHE LOOKED UP HER EYES UNMISTAKABLY SOUGHT MINE AND HER SMILE SEEMED WARM AND INVITING SHE MADE AGAIN THAT STRANGE LITTLE GESTURE OF INVITATION WITH AN EFFORT I GLANCED AT MERCER
8088-284756-0073 THERE WAS SOMETHING DEVILISHLY FASCINATING ABOUT THE GIRL'S GREAT DARK SEARCHING EYES I'M GOING IN I SAID HOARSELY
8088-284756-0074 I HEADED DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE HEAVY BRONZE LADDER THAT LED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I HAD TWO REASONS IN MIND I WOULD NEED SOMETHING TO KEEP ME UNDER WATER WITH MY LUNGS FULL OF AIR AND I COULD GET OUT QUICKLY IF IT WERE NECESSARY
8088-284756-0075 I HAD NOT FORGOTTEN THE LIVID JAGGED FURROWS IN MERCER'S SIDE QUICKLY AS I SHOT TO THE LADDER SHE WAS THERE BEFORE ME A DIM WAVERING WHITE SHAPE WAITING I PAUSED HOLDING TO A RUNG OF THE LADDER WITH ONE HAND
8088-284756-0076 SHE CAME CLOSER WALKING WITH THE AIRY GRACE I HAD NOTED BEFORE AND MY HEART POUNDED AGAINST MY RIBS AS SHE RAISED ONE LONG SLIM ARM TOWARDS ME
8088-284756-0077 PERHAPS I THOUGHT QUICKLY THIS WAS WITH HER A SIGN OF GREETING I LIFTED MY OWN ARM AND RETURNED THE SALUTATION IF SALUTATION IT WERE AWARE OF A STRANGE RISING AND FALLING SOUND AS OF A DISTANT HUMMING IN MY EARS
8088-284756-0078 THE SOUND CEASED SUDDENLY ON A RISING NOTE AS THOUGH OF INQUIRY AND IT DAWNED ON ME THAT I HAD HEARD THE SPEECH OF THIS STRANGE CREATURE BEFORE I COULD THINK OF A COURSE OF ACTION MY ACHING LUNGS REMINDED ME OF THE NEED OF AIR
8088-284756-0079 AND I RELEASED MY HOLD ON THE LADDER AND LET MY BODY RISE TO THE SURFACE
8088-284756-0080 I LOOKED DOWN THE GIRL WAS WATCHING ME AND THERE WAS NO SMILE ON HER FACE NOW
8088-284756-0081 AS HER FACE CAME CLOSE TO MY OWN I BECAME AWARE OF THE HUMMING CROONING SOUND I HAD HEARD BEFORE LOUDER THIS TIME
8088-284756-0082 I SMILED BACK AT HER AND SHOOK MY HEAD
8088-284756-0083 I POINTED UPWARD FOR I WAS FEELING THE NEED FOR FRESH AIR AGAIN AND SLOWLY MOUNTED THE LADDER THIS TIME SHE DID NOT GRASP ME BUT WATCHED ME INTENTLY AS THOUGH UNDERSTANDING WHAT I DID AND THE REASONS FOR IT
8088-284756-0084 BRING ONE OF YOUR GADGETS OVER HERE MERCER I CALLED ACROSS THE POOL I THINK I'M MAKING PROGRESS GOOD BOY HE CRIED AND CAME RUNNING WITH TWO OF THE ANTENNAE THE LONG INSULATED CORDS TRAILING BEHIND HIM THROUGH THE WATER THE GIRL WATCHED HIM EVIDENT DISLIKE IN HER EYES
8088-284756-0085 THE SALT WATER WOULD SHORT THE ANTENNAE YOU SEE TRY TO GET HER TO WEAR ONE AND THEN YOU GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF WATER AND DON YOURS AND REMEMBER SHE WON'T BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH US BY WORDS WE'LL HAVE TO GET HER TO CONVEY HER THOUGHTS BY MEANS OF MENTAL PICTURES
8088-284756-0086 I'LL TRY TO IMPRESS THAT ON HER UNDERSTAND I NODDED AND PICKED UP ONE OF THE INSTRUMENTS FIRE WHEN READY GRIDLEY I COMMENTED AND SANK AGAIN TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I TOUCHED THE GIRL'S HEAD WITH ONE FINGER AND THEN POINTED TO MY OWN HEAD
8088-284756-0087 TRYING TO CONVEY TO HER THAT SHE COULD GET HER THOUGHTS TO ME THEN I HELD UP THE ANTENNAE AND PLACED IT ON MY OWN HEAD TO SHOW THAT IT COULD NOT HARM HER MY NEXT MOVE WAS TO OFFER HER THE INSTRUMENT MOVING SLOWLY AND SMILING REASSURINGLY
8088-284756-0088 NO MEAN FEAT UNDER WATER SHE HESITATED A MOMENT AND THEN HER EYES FIXED ON MINE
8088-284756-0089 I SMILED AND NODDED AND PRESSED HER SHOULDER IN TOKEN OF FRIENDLY GREETING THEN GESTURING TOWARD MY OWN HEAD AGAIN AND POINTING UPWARD I CLIMBED THE LADDER ALL RIGHT MERCER I SHOUTED START AT ONCE BEFORE SHE GROWS RESTLESS
8088-284756-0090 I'VE ALREADY STARTED HE CALLED BACK AND I HURRIEDLY DONNED MY OWN INSTRUMENT
8088-284756-0091 SO THAT MY HEAD REMAINED OUT OF WATER AND SMILED DOWN AT THE GIRL TOUCHING THE INSTRUMENT ON MY HEAD AND THEN POINTING TO HERS I COULD SENSE MERCER'S THOUGHTS NOW HE WAS PICTURING HIMSELF WALKING LONG THE SHORE WITH THE STORMY OCEAN IN THE BACKGROUND
8088-284756-0092 I SAW HIM RUN UP TO THE POOL AND LIFT THE SLIM PALE FIGURE IN HIS ARMS
8088-284756-0093 I VISUALIZED THEM JUST AS I COULD CLOSE MY EYES AND VISUALIZE FOR EXAMPLE THE FIREPLACE IN THE LIVING ROOM OF MY OWN HOME I LOOKED DOWN AT THE GIRL SHE WAS FROWNING AND HER EYES WERE VERY WIDE
8088-284756-0094 HER HEAD WAS A LITTLE ON ONE SIDE IN THE ATTITUDE OF ONE WHO LISTENS INTENTLY SLOWLY AND CAREFULLY MERCER THOUGHT OUT THE WHOLE STORY OF HIS EXPERIENCES WITH THE GIRL UNTIL SHE HAD PLUNGED INTO THE POOL THEN I SAW AGAIN THE BEACH
8088-284756-0095 I WAS AWARE OF THE SOFT LITTLE TICK IN THE CENTER OF MY BRAIN THAT ANNOUNCED THAT THE SWITCH HAD BEEN MOVED TO ANOTHER CONTACT POINT I GLANCED DOWN AT HER SHE WAS STARING UP AT ME WITH HER GREAT CURIOUS EYES
8088-284756-0096 AND I SENSED THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF THE INSTRUMENT I WORE THAT SHE WAS THINKING OF ME I SAW MY OWN FEATURES IDEALIZED GLOWING WITH A STRANGE BEAUTY THAT WAS CERTAINLY NONE OF MY OWN I REALIZED THAT I SAW MYSELF IN SHORT AS SHE SAW ME
8088-284756-0097 A DIM BLUISH LIGHT FILTERED DOWN ON A SCENE SUCH AS MORTAL EYES HAVE NEVER SEEN ALL AROUND WERE STRANGE STRUCTURES OF JAGGED CORAL ROUGHLY CIRCULAR AS TO BASE AND ROUNDED ON TOP RESEMBLING VERY MUCH THE IGLOOS OF THE ESKIMOS
8088-284756-0098 THE STRUCTURES VARIED GREATLY IN SIZE AND SEEMED TO BE ARRANGED IN SOME SORT OF REGULAR ORDER LIKE HOUSES ALONG A NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0099 AROUND MANY OF THEM GREW CLUSTERS OF STRANGE AND COLORFUL SEAWEEDS THAT WAVED THEIR BANNERS GENTLY AS THOUGH SOME IMPERCEPTIBLE CURRENT DALLIED WITH THEM IN PASSING HERE AND THERE FIGURES MOVED SLIM WHITE FIGURES THAT STROLLED ALONG THE NARROW STREET
8088-284756-0100 OR AT TIMES SHOT OVERHEAD LIKE VERITABLE TORPEDOES THERE WERE BOTH MEN AND WOMEN MOVING THERE THE MEN WERE BROADER OF SHOULDER AND THEIR HAIR WHICH THEY WORE TO THEIR KNEES WAS SOMEWHAT DARKER IN COLOR THAN THAT OF THE WOMEN BOTH SEXES WERE SLIM
8088-284756-0101 AND THERE WAS A REMARKABLE UNIFORMITY OF SIZE AND APPEARANCE NONE OF THE STRANGE BEINGS WORE GARMENTS OF ANY KIND NOR WERE THEY NECESSARY
8088-284756-0102 THE CLINGING TRESSES WERE CINCTURED AT THE WAIST WITH A SORT OF CORD OF TWISTED ORANGE COLORED MATERIAL AND SOME OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN WORE BANDS OF THE SAME MATERIAL AROUND THEIR BROWS NEAREST OF ALL THE FIGURES WAS THE GIRL WHO WAS VISUALIZING ALL THIS FOR US
8088-284756-0103 SHE WAS WALKING SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE CLUSTER OF CORAL STRUCTURES ONCE OR TWICE SHE PAUSED AND SEEMED TO HOLD CONVERSATION WITH OTHERS OF THE STRANGE PEOPLE BUT EACH TIME SHE MOVED ON THE CORAL STRUCTURES GREW SMALLER AND POORER
8088-284756-0104 FINALLY THE GIRL TROD ALONE ON THE FLOOR OF THE OCEAN BETWEEN GREAT GROWTHS OF KELP AND SEAWEEDS WITH DIM LOOMING MASSES OF FAINTLY TINTED CORAL EVERYWHERE ONCE SHE PASSED CLOSE TO A TILTED RAGGED HULK OF SOME ANCIENT VESSEL
8088-284756-0105 ITS NAKED RIBS PACKED WITH DRIFTED SAND SAUNTERING DREAMILY SHE MOVED AWAY FROM THE ANCIENT DERELICT SUDDENLY A DIM SHADOW SWEPT ACROSS THE SAND AT HER FEET AND SHE ARROWED FROM THE SPOT LIKE A WHITE SLIM METEOR
8088-284756-0106 BUT BEHIND HER DARTED A BLACK AND SWIFTER SHADOW A SHARK LIKE A FLASH SHE TURNED AND FACED THE MONSTER SOMETHING SHE HAD DRAWN FROM HER GIRDLE SHONE PALELY IN HER HAND IT WAS A KNIFE OF WHETTED STONE OR BONE
8088-284756-0107 THE WHITE FIGURE OF THE GIRL SHOT ONWARD THROUGH THE SCARLET FLOOD BLINDED SHE DID NOT SEE THAT THE JUTTING RIBS OF THE ANCIENT SHIP WERE IN HER PATH I SEEMED TO SEE HER CRASH HEAD ON INTO ONE OF THE MASSIVE TIMBERS
8088-284756-0108 AND I CRIED OUT INVOLUNTARILY AND GLANCED DOWN AT THE GIRL IN THE WATER AT MY FEET HER EYES WERE GLOWING SHE KNEW THAT I HAD UNDERSTOOD HAZILY THEN I SEEMED TO VISUALIZE HER BODY FLOATING LIMPLY IN THE WATER IT WAS ALL VERY VAGUE AND INDISTINCT
8088-284756-0109 THE GIRL WAS THINKING OF HER SUFFERING TAKEN OUT OF HER NATIVE ELEMENT
8088-284756-0110 THAT NO DOUBT WAS WHY SHE HATED HIM
8088-284756-0111 ADJUSTED TO HER OWN IDEAS OF WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE I FLUNG THE INSTRUMENT FROM MY HEAD AND DROPPED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE POOL I GRIPPED BOTH HER SHOULDERS GENTLY TO EXPRESS MY THANKS AND FRIENDSHIP MY HEART WAS POUNDING
8088-284756-0112 THERE WAS A STRANGE FASCINATION ABOUT THIS GIRL FROM THE DEPTHS OF THE SEA A SUBTLE APPEAL THAT WAS ANSWERED FROM SOME DEEP SUBTERRANEAN CAVERN OF MY BEING I FORGOT FOR THE MOMENT WHO AND WHAT I WAS
8088-284756-0113 HER GREAT WEIRDLY BLUE EYES SEEMED TO BORE INTO MY BRAIN I COULD FEEL THEM THROBBING THERE I FORGOT TIME AND SPACE I SAW ONLY THAT PALE SMILING FACE AND THOSE GREAT DARK EYES
8088-284756-0114 THEN STRANGLING I TORE MYSELF FROM HER EMBRACE AND SHOT TO THE SURFACE COUGHING I CLEARED MY LUNGS OF THE WATER I HAD INHALED I WAS WEAK AND SHAKING WHEN I FINISHED BUT MY HEAD WAS CLEAR THE GRIP OF THE STRANGE FANTASY THAT HAD GRIPPED ME WAS SHAKEN OFF
8088-284756-0115 MERCER WAS BENDING OVER ME SPEAKING SOFTLY I WAS WATCHING OLD MAN HE SAID GENTLY I CAN IMAGINE WHAT HAPPENED A MOMENTARY PSYCHIC FUSING OF AN ANCIENT LONG SINCE BROKEN LINK YOU TOGETHER WITH ALL MANKIND CAME UP OUT OF THE SEA
8088-284756-0116 BUT THERE IS NO RETRACING THE WAY I NODDED MY HEAD BOWED ON MY STREAMING CHEST SORRY MERCER I MUTTERED SOMETHING GOT INTO ME THOSE BIG EYES OF HERS SEEMED TO TUG AT THREADS OF MEMORY BURIED I CAN'T DESCRIBE IT
8088-284756-0117 IT HELPED JERK ME BACK TO THE NORMAL YOU'VE GOT YOUR FEET ON THE GROUND AGAIN TAYLOR HE COMMENTED SOOTHINGLY I THINK THERE'S NO DANGER OF YOU LOSING YOUR GRIP ON TERRA FIRMA AGAIN SHALL WE CARRY ON THERE'S MORE YOU'D LIKE TO LEARN THAT YOU THINK SHE CAN GIVE US
8088-284756-0118 I ASKED HESITANTLY I BELIEVE REPLIED MERCER THAT SHE CAN GIVE US THE HISTORY OF HER PEOPLE IF WE CAN ONLY MAKE HER UNDERSTAND WHAT WE WISH GOD IF WE ONLY COULD
8088-284756-0119 WE CAN TRY OLD TIMER I SAID A BIT SHAKENLY MERCER HURRIED BACK TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL AND I ADJUSTED MY HEAD SET AGAIN SMILING DOWN AT THE GIRL
8095-274345-0000 NO SOONER HAD CHARLES TAKEN INTO HIS HANDS THE REINS OF GOVERNMENT THAN HE SHOWED AN IMPATIENCE TO ASSEMBLE THE GREAT COUNCIL OF THE NATION AND HE WOULD GLADLY FOR THE SAKE OF DESPATCH HAVE CALLED TOGETHER THE SAME PARLIAMENT WHICH HAD SITTEN UNDER HIS FATHER
8095-274345-0001 AND WHICH LAY AT THAT TIME UNDER PROROGATION BUT BEING TOLD THAT THIS MEASURE WOULD APPEAR UNUSUAL HE ISSUED WRITS FOR SUMMONING A NEW PARLIAMENT ON THE SEVENTH OF MAY AND IT WAS NOT WITHOUT REGRET THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRINCESS HENRIETTA
8095-274345-0002 UNEXPERIENCED AND IMPOLITIC REGARDED AS SINCERE ALL THE PRAISES AND CARESSES WITH WHICH HE HAD BEEN LOADED WHILE ACTIVE IN PROCURING THE RUPTURE WITH THE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AND BESIDES THAT HE LABORED UNDER GREAT NECESSITIES
8095-274345-0003 HE LIGHTLY MENTIONED THE OCCASION WHICH HE HAD FOR SUPPLY HE EMPLOYED NO INTRIGUE TO INFLUENCE THE SUFFRAGES OF THE MEMBERS HE WOULD NOT EVEN ALLOW THE OFFICERS OF THE CROWN WHO HAD SEATS IN THE HOUSE
8095-274345-0004 AND THAT GREAT ANTICIPATIONS WERE LIKEWISE MADE ON THE REVENUES OF THE CROWN THEY WERE NOT IGNORANT THAT CHARLES WAS LOADED WITH A LARGE DEBT CONTRACTED BY HIS FATHER WHO HAD BORROWED MONEY BOTH FROM HIS OWN SUBJECTS AND FROM FOREIGN PRINCES
8095-274345-0005 THEY HAD LEARNED BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE PUBLIC REVENUE COULD WITH DIFFICULTY MAINTAIN THE DIGNITY OF THE CROWN EVEN UNDER THE ORDINARY CHARGES OF GOVERNMENT
8095-274345-0006 THEY WERE SENSIBLE THAT THE PRESENT WAR WAS VERY LATELY THE RESULT OF THEIR OWN IMPORTUNATE APPLICATIONS AND ENTREATIES AND THAT THEY HAD SOLEMNLY ENGAGED TO SUPPORT THEIR SOVEREIGN IN THE MANAGEMENT OF IT
8095-274345-0007 THEY WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE DIFFICULTY OF MILITARY ENTERPRISES DIRECTED AGAINST THE WHOLE HOUSE OF AUSTRIA AGAINST THE KING OF SPAIN POSSESSED OF THE GREATEST RICHES AND MOST EXTENSIVE DOMINIONS OF ANY PRINCE IN EUROPE
8095-274345-0008 AGAINST THE EMPEROR FERDINAND HITHERTO THE MOST FORTUNATE MONARCH OF HIS AGE WHO HAD SUBDUED AND ASTONISHED GERMANY BY THE RAPIDITY OF HIS VICTORIES DEEP IMPRESSIONS THEY SAW MUST BE MADE BY THE ENGLISH SWORD
8095-274345-0009 AND A VIGOROUS OFFENSIVE WAR BE WAGED AGAINST THESE MIGHTY POTENTATES ERE THEY WOULD RESIGN A PRINCIPALITY WHICH THEY HAD NOW FULLY SUBDUED AND WHICH THEY HELD IN SECURE POSSESSION BY ITS BEING SURROUNDED WITH ALL THEIR OTHER TERRITORIES
8095-274345-0010 TO ANSWER THEREFORE ALL THESE GREAT AND IMPORTANT ENDS TO SATISFY THEIR YOUNG KING IN THE FIRST REQUEST WHICH HE MADE THEM TO PROVE THEIR SENSE OF THE MANY ROYAL VIRTUES PARTICULARLY ECONOMY WITH WHICH CHARLES WAS ENDUED
8095-274345-0011 THE HOUSE OF COMMONS CONDUCTED BY THE WISEST AND ABLEST SENATORS THAT HAD EVER FLOURISHED IN ENGLAND THOUGHT PROPER TO CONFER ON THE KING A SUPPLY OF TWO SUBSIDIES
8095-274345-0012 WHICH THE PRESENT CONJUNCTURE COULD SUGGEST TO THEM IT IS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT SPLEEN AND ILL WILL AGAINST THE DUKE OF BUCKINGHAM HAD AN INFLUENCE WITH MANY SO VAST AND RAPID A FORTUNE SO LITTLE MERITED
8095-274345-0013 COULD NOT FAIL TO EXCITE PUBLIC ENVY AND HOWEVER MEN'S HATRED MIGHT HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED FOR A MOMENT WHILE THE DUKE'S CONDUCT SEEMED TO GRATIFY THEIR PASSIONS AND THEIR PREJUDICES IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM LONG TO PRESERVE THE AFFECTIONS OF THE PEOPLE
8095-274345-0014 HIS INFLUENCE OVER THE MODESTY OF CHARLES EXCEEDED EVEN THAT WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRED OVER THE WEAKNESS OF JAMES NOR WAS ANY PUBLIC MEASURE CONDUCTED BUT BY HIS COUNSEL AND DIRECTION
8095-274345-0015 HIS VEHEMENT TEMPER PROMPTED HIM TO RAISE SUDDENLY TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATION HIS FLATTERERS AND DEPENDANTS AND UPON THE LEAST OCCASION OF DISPLEASURE HE THREW THEM DOWN WITH EQUAL IMPETUOSITY AND VIOLENCE IMPLACABLE IN HIS HATRED
8095-274345-0016 FICKLE IN HIS FRIENDSHIPS ALL MEN WERE EITHER REGARDED AS HIS ENEMIES OR DREADED SOON TO BECOME SUCH THE WHOLE POWER OF THE KINGDOM WAS GRASPED BY HIS INSATIABLE HAND WHILE HE BOTH ENGROSSED THE ENTIRE CONFIDENCE OF HIS MASTER
8095-274345-0017 AND HELD INVESTED IN HIS SINGLE PERSON THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OFFICES OF THE CROWN HOWEVER THE ILL HUMOR OF THE COMMONS MIGHT HAVE BEEN INCREASED BY THESE CONSIDERATIONS WE ARE NOT TO SUPPOSE THEM THE SOLE MOTIVES
8095-274345-0018 THE LAST PARLIAMENT OF JAMES AMIDST ALL THEIR JOY AND FESTIVITY HAD GIVEN HIM A SUPPLY VERY DISPROPORTIONED TO HIS DEMAND AND TO THE OCCASION AND AS EVERY HOUSE OF COMMONS WHICH WAS ELECTED DURING FORTY YEARS
8095-274345-0019 SUCCEEDED TO ALL THE PASSIONS AND PRINCIPLES OF THEIR PREDECESSORS WE OUGHT RATHER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS OBSTINACY FROM THE GENERAL SITUATION OF THE KINGDOM DURING THAT WHOLE PERIOD THAN FROM ANY CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH ATTENDED THIS PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE
8095-274345-0020 THE NATION WAS VERY LITTLE ACCUSTOMED AT THAT TIME TO THE BURDEN OF TAXES AND HAD NEVER OPENED THEIR PURSES IN ANY DEGREE FOR SUPPORTING THEIR SOVEREIGN EVEN ELIZABETH NOTWITHSTANDING HER VIGOR AND FRUGALITY
8095-274345-0021 AND THE NECESSARY WARS IN WHICH SHE WAS ENGAGED HAD REASON TO COMPLAIN OF THE COMMONS IN THIS PARTICULAR NOR COULD THE AUTHORITY OF THAT PRINCESS WHICH WAS OTHERWISE ALMOST ABSOLUTE EVER EXTORT FROM THEM THE REQUISITE SUPPLIES
8095-274345-0022 WOULD NOT AUGMENT THEIR NUMBER IN THE SAME PROPORTION THE PURITANICAL PARTY THOUGH DISGUISED HAD A GREAT AUTHORITY OVER THE KINGDOM AND MANY OF THE LEADERS AMONG THE COMMONS HAD SECRETLY EMBRACED THE RIGID TENETS OF THAT SECT
8095-274345-0023 ALL THESE WERE DISGUSTED WITH THE COURT BOTH BY THE PREVALENCE OF THE PRINCIPLES OF CIVIL LIBERTY ESSENTIAL TO THEIR PARTY AND ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESTRAINT UNDER WHICH THEY WERE HELD BY THE ESTABLISHED HIERARCHY
8095-274345-0024 IN ORDER TO FORTIFY HIMSELF AGAINST THE RESENTMENT OF JAMES BUCKINGHAM HAD AFFECTED POPULARITY AND ENTERED INTO THE CABALS OF THE PURITANS BUT BEING SECURE OF THE CONFIDENCE OF CHARLES HE HAD SINCE ABANDONED THIS PARTY
8095-274345-0025 AND ON THAT ACCOUNT WAS THE MORE EXPOSED TO THEIR HATRED AND RESENTMENT THOUGH THE RELIGIOUS SCHEMES OF MANY OF THE PURITANS WHEN EXPLAINED APPEAR PRETTY FRIVOLOUS WE ARE NOT THENCE TO IMAGINE THAT THEY WERE PURSUED BY NONE BUT PERSONS OF WEAK UNDERSTANDINGS
8095-274345-0026 THE MATCH WITH FRANCE AND THE ARTICLES IN FAVOR OF CATHOLICS WHICH WERE SUSPECTED TO BE IN THE TREATY WERE LIKEWISE CAUSES OF DISGUST TO THIS WHOLE PARTY
8095-274345-0027 THOUGH IT MUST BE REMARKED THAT THE CONNECTIONS WITH THAT CROWN WERE MUCH LESS OBNOXIOUS TO THE PROTESTANTS AND LESS AGREEABLE TO THE CATHOLICS THAN THE ALLIANCE FORMERLY PROJECTED WITH SPAIN AND WERE THEREFORE RECEIVED RATHER WITH PLEASURE THAN DISSATISFACTION
8095-274345-0028 AS BY THE HARDSHIPS WHICH SOME OF THEM HAD UNDERGONE IN PROSECUTION OF THEM AMONG THESE WE MAY MENTION THE NAMES OF SIR EDWARD COKE SIR EDWIN SANDYS SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR
8095-274345-0029 SIR DUDLEY DIGGES SIR JOHN ELLIOT SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH MISTER SELDEN AND MISTER PYM ANIMATED WITH A WARM REGARD TO LIBERTY
8095-274345-0030 OF REDUCING THE PREROGATIVE WITHIN MORE REASONABLE COMPASS THOUGH THEIR ANCESTORS HAD BLINDLY GIVEN WAY TO PRACTICES AND PRECEDENTS FAVORABLE TO KINGLY POWER AND HAD BEEN ABLE NOTWITHSTANDING TO PRESERVE SOME SMALL REMAINS OF LIBERTY
8095-274345-0031 IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE THEY THOUGHT WHEN ALL THESE PRETENSIONS WERE METHODISED AND PROSECUTED BY THE INCREASING KNOWLEDGE OF THE AGE TO MAINTAIN ANY SHADOW OF POPULAR GOVERNMENT IN OPPOSITION TO SUCH UNLIMITED AUTHORITY IN THE SOVEREIGN
8095-274345-0032 IT WAS NECESSARY TO FIX A CHOICE EITHER TO ABANDON ENTIRELY THE PRIVILEGES OF THE PEOPLE OR TO SECURE THEM BY FIRMER AND MORE PRECISE BARRIERS THAN THE CONSTITUTION HAD HITHERTO PROVIDED FOR THEM IN THIS DILEMMA
8095-274345-0033 MEN OF SUCH ASPIRING GENIUSES AND SUCH INDEPENDENT FORTUNES COULD NOT LONG DELIBERATE THEY BOLDLY EMBRACED THE SIDE OF FREEDOM AND RESOLVED TO GRANT NO SUPPLIES TO THEIR NECESSITOUS PRINCE WITHOUT EXTORTING CONCESSIONS IN FAVOR OF CIVIL LIBERTY
8095-274345-0034 THE END THEY ESTEEMED BENEFICENT AND NOBLE THE MEANS REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL TO GRANT OR REFUSE SUPPLIES WAS THE UNDOUBTED PRIVILEGE OF THE COMMONS AND AS ALL HUMAN GOVERNMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE OF A MIXED FRAME
8095-274345-0035 ARE IN CONTINUAL FLUCTUATION IT WAS AS NATURAL IN THEIR OPINION AND ALLOWABLE FOR POPULAR ASSEMBLIES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE INCIDENTS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE SUBJECT
8095-274346-0000 CHARLES GAVE THEM A GRACIOUS AND A COMPLIANT ANSWER TO ALL THEIR REMONSTRANCES HE WAS HOWEVER IN HIS HEART EXTREMELY AVERSE TO THESE FURIOUS MEASURES
8095-274346-0001 THOUGH A DETERMINED PROTESTANT BY PRINCIPLE AS WELL AS INCLINATION HE HAD ENTERTAINED NO VIOLENT HORROR AGAINST POPERY AND A LITTLE HUMANITY HE THOUGHT WAS DUE BY THE NATION TO THE RELIGION OF THEIR ANCESTORS
8095-274346-0002 AN ABATEMENT OF THE MORE RIGOROUS LAWS WAS ALL HE INTENDED AND HIS ENGAGEMENTS WITH FRANCE NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THEIR REGULAR EXECUTION HAD NEVER BEEN PROMISED OR EXPECTED REQUIRED OF HIM SOME INDULGENCE
8095-274346-0003 BUT SO UNFORTUNATE WAS THIS PRINCE THAT NO MEASURE EMBRACED DURING HIS WHOLE REIGN WAS EVER ATTENDED WITH MORE UNHAPPY AND MORE FATAL CONSEQUENCES
8095-274346-0004 THE EXTREME RAGE AGAINST POPERY WAS A SURE CHARACTERISTIC OF PURITANISM THE HOUSE OF COMMONS DISCOVERED OTHER INFALLIBLE SYMPTOMS OF THE PREVALENCE OF THAT PARTY
8095-274346-0005 THEY PETITIONED THE KING FOR REPLACING SUCH ABLE CLERGY AS HAD BEEN SILENCED FOR WANT OF CONFORMITY TO THE CEREMONIES THEY ALSO ENACTED LAWS FOR THE STRICT OBSERVANCE OF SUNDAY WHICH THE PURITANS AFFECTED TO CALL THE SABBATH
8095-274346-0006 AND WHICH THEY SANCTIFIED BY THE MOST MELANCHOLY INDOLENCE IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THE DIFFERENT APPELLATIONS OF THIS FESTIVAL WERE AT THAT TIME KNOWN SYMBOLS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTIES
8095-274346-0007 THE KING FINDING THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS RESOLVED TO GRANT HIM NO SUPPLY AND WOULD FURNISH HIM WITH NOTHING BUT EMPTY PROTESTATIONS OF DUTY
8095-274346-0008 WAS INTRUSTED WITH THE COMMAND HE SAILED IMMEDIATELY FOR CADIZ AND FOUND THE BAY FULL OF SPANISH SHIPS OF GREAT VALUE HE EITHER NEGLECTED TO ATTACK THESE SHIPS OR ATTEMPTED IT PREPOSTEROUSLY
8095-274346-0009 THE ARMY WAS LANDED AND A FORT TAKEN BUT THE UNDISCIPLINED SOLDIERS FINDING STORE OF WINE COULD NOT BE RESTRAINED FROM THE UTMOST EXCESSES FURTHER STAY APPEARING FRUITLESS THEY WERE REEMBARKED AND THE FLEET PUT TO SEA
8095-274346-0010 WITH AN INTENTION OF INTERCEPTING THE SPANISH GALLEONS BUT THE PLAGUE HAVING SEIZED THE SEAMEN AND SOLDIERS THEY WERE OBLIGED TO ABANDON ALL HOPES OF THIS PRIZE AND RETURN TO ENGLAND LOUD COMPLAINTS WERE MADE AGAINST THE COURT FOR INTRUSTING SO IMPORTANT A COMMAND
8095-274346-0011 WAS OBLIGED AGAIN TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A PARLIAMENT THOUGH THE ILL SUCCESS OF HIS ENTERPRISES DIMINISHED HIS AUTHORITY AND SHOWED EVERY DAY MORE PLAINLY THE IMPRUDENCE OF THE SPANISH WAR THOUGH THE INCREASE OF HIS NECESSITIES
8095-274346-0012 RENDERED HIM MORE DEPENDENT AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE ENCROACHMENTS OF THE COMMONS HE WAS RESOLVED TO TRY ONCE MORE THAT REGULAR AND CONSTITUTIONAL EXPEDIENT FOR SUPPLY PERHAPS TOO A LITTLE POLITICAL ART WHICH AT THAT TIME HE PRACTISED
8095-274346-0013 WAS MUCH TRUSTED TO HE HAD NAMED FOUR POPULAR LEADERS SHERIFFS OF COUNTIES SIR EDWARD COKE SIR ROBERT PHILIPS SIR THOMAS WENTWORTH AND SIR FRANCIS SEYMOUR AND THOUGH THE QUESTION HAD BEEN FORMERLY MUCH CONTESTED
8095-274346-0014 HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD BY THAT MEANS INCAPACITATED THEM FROM BEING ELECTED MEMBERS BUT HIS INTENTION BEING SO EVIDENT RATHER PUT THE COMMONS MORE UPON THEIR GUARD
8095-274346-0015 ENOW OF PATRIOTS STILL REMAINED TO KEEP UP THE ILL HUMOR OF THE HOUSE AND MEN NEEDED BUT LITTLE INSTRUCTION OR RHETORIC TO RECOMMEND TO THEM PRACTICES
8095-274346-0016 THE SUM WAS LITTLE PROPORTIONED TO THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION AND ILL FITTED TO PROMOTE THOSE VIEWS OF SUCCESS AND GLORY FOR WHICH THE YOUNG PRINCE IN HIS FIRST ENTERPRISE SO ARDENTLY LONGED BUT THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WAS NOT THE MOST DISAGREEABLE ONE
8095-274346-0017 THE SUPPLY WAS ONLY VOTED BY THE COMMONS THE PASSING OF THAT VOTE INTO A LAW WAS RESERVED TILL THE END OF THE SESSION A CONDITION WAS THEREBY MADE IN A VERY UNDISGUISED MANNER WITH THEIR SOVEREIGN
8095-274346-0018 UNDER COLOR OF REDRESSING GRIEVANCES WHICH DURING THIS SHORT REIGN COULD NOT BE VERY NUMEROUS THEY WERE TO PROCEED IN REGULATING AND CONTROLLING EVERY PART OF GOVERNMENT WHICH DISPLEASED THEM
8095-274346-0019 AND IF THE KING EITHER CUT THEM SHORT IN THIS UNDERTAKING OR REFUSED COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR DEMANDS HE MUST NOT EXPECT ANY SUPPLY FROM THE COMMONS GREAT DISSATISFACTION WAS EXPRESSED BY CHARLES AT A TREATMENT WHICH HE DEEMED SO HARSH AND UNDUTIFUL
8095-274346-0020 BUT HIS URGENT NECESSITIES OBLIGED HIM TO SUBMIT
8095-274346-0021 HAD EXPRESSED ALL DUTY AND OBEDIENCE IN EXPECTATION THAT AN OPPORTUNITY WOULD OFFER OF REINSTATING HIMSELF IN HIS FORMER CREDIT AND AUTHORITY EVEN AFTER CHARLES'S ACCESSION HE DESPAIRED NOT
8095-274346-0022 HE SUBMITTED TO THE KING'S COMMANDS OF REMAINING AT HIS COUNTRY SEAT AND OF ABSENTING HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT MANY TRIALS HE MADE TO REGAIN THE GOOD OPINION OF HIS MASTER
8095-274346-0023 BUT FINDING THEM ALL FRUITLESS AND OBSERVING CHARLES TO BE ENTIRELY GOVERNED BY BUCKINGHAM HIS IMPLACABLE ENEMY HE RESOLVED NO LONGER TO KEEP ANY MEASURES WITH THE COURT A NEW SPIRIT HE SAW AND A NEW POWER ARISING IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0024 AND TO THESE HE WAS DETERMINED FOR THE FUTURE TO TRUST FOR HIS SECURITY AND PROTECTION WHEN THE PARLIAMENT WAS SUMMONED CHARLES BY A STRETCH OF PREROGATIVE HAD GIVEN ORDERS THAT NO WRIT AS IS CUSTOMARY SHOULD BE SENT TO BRISTOL
8095-274346-0025 THAT NOBLEMAN APPLIED TO THE HOUSE OF LORDS BY PETITION AND CRAVED THEIR GOOD OFFICES WITH THE KING FOR OBTAINING WHAT WAS HIS DUE AS A PEER OF THE REALM HIS WRIT WAS SENT HIM BUT ACCOMPANIED WITH A LETTER FROM THE LORD KEEPER COVENTRY
8095-274346-0026 COMMANDING HIM IN THE KING'S NAME TO ABSENT HIMSELF FROM PARLIAMENT THIS LETTER BRISTOL CONVEYED TO THE LORDS AND ASKED ADVICE HOW TO PROCEED IN SO DELICATE A SITUATION
8095-274346-0027 THE KING'S PROHIBITION WAS WITHDRAWN AND BRISTOL TOOK HIS SEAT PROVOKED AT THESE REPEATED INSTANCES OF VIGOR WHICH THE COURT DENOMINATED CONTUMACY CHARLES ORDERED HIS ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ENTER AN ACCUSATION OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST HIM
8095-274346-0028 BY WAY OF RECRIMINATION BRISTOL ACCUSED BUCKINGHAM OF HIGH TREASON BOTH THE EARL'S DEFENCE OF HIMSELF AND ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE REMAIN AND TOGETHER WITH SOME ORIGINAL LETTERS STILL EXTANT
8095-274346-0029 OF DELIVERING SHIPS TO THE FRENCH KING IN ORDER TO SERVE AGAINST THE HUGONOTS OF BEING EMPLOYED IN THE SALE OF HONORS AND OFFICES OF ACCEPTING EXTENSIVE GRANTS FROM THE CROWN OF PROCURING MANY TITLES OF HONOR FOR HIS KINDRED
8095-274346-0030 AND OF ADMINISTERING PHYSIC TO THE LATE KING WITHOUT ACQUAINTING HIS PHYSICIANS ALL THESE ARTICLES APPEAR FROM COMPARING THE ACCUSATION AND REPLY TO BE EITHER FRIVOLOUS OR FALSE OR BOTH
8095-274346-0031 THE ONLY CHARGE WHICH COULD BE REGARDED AS IMPORTANT WAS THAT HE HAD EXTORTED A SUM OF TEN THOUSAND POUNDS FROM THE EAST INDIA COMPANY AND THAT HE HAD CONFISCATED SOME GOODS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS ON PRETENCE OF THEIR BEING THE PROPERTY OF SPANISH
8095-274346-0032 SO THAT IT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO GIVE A DECISIVE OPINION WITH REGARD TO THESE ARTICLES
8095-274346-0033 BUT SO RIVETTED THROUGHOUT THE NATION WERE THE PREJUDICES WITH REGARD TO SPANISH DECEIT AND FALSEHOOD THAT VERY FEW OF THE COMMONS SEEM AS YET TO HAVE BEEN CONVINCED THAT THEY HAD BEEN SEDUCED BY BUCKINGHAM'S NARRATIVE
8095-274346-0034 A CERTAIN PROOF THAT A DISCOVERY OF THIS NATURE WAS NOT AS IS IMAGINED BY SEVERAL HISTORIANS
8095-274346-0035 THE KING SEEMED DESIROUS OF EMBRACING EVERY OPPORTUNITY BY WHICH HE COULD EXPRESS A CONTEMPT AND DISREGARD FOR THEM NO ONE WAS AT THAT TIME SUFFICIENTLY SENSIBLE OF THE GREAT WEIGHT WHICH THE COMMONS BORE IN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
8095-274346-0036 THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND HAD NEVER HITHERTO AFFORDED ONE INSTANCE WHERE ANY GREAT MOVEMENT OR REVOLUTION HAD PROCEEDED FROM THE LOWER HOUSE AND AS THEIR RANK BOTH CONSIDERED IN A BODY AND AS INDIVIDUALS WAS BUT THE SECOND IN THE KINGDOM
8095-274346-0037 NOTHING LESS THAN FATAL EXPERIENCE COULD ENGAGE THE ENGLISH PRINCES TO PAY A DUE REGARD TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THAT FORMIDABLE ASSEMBLY THE EARL OF SUFFOLK CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE DYING ABOUT THIS TIME
8095-274346-0038 BUCKINGHAM THOUGH LYING UNDER IMPEACHMENT WAS YET BY MEANS OF COURT INTEREST CHOSEN IN HIS PLACE THE COMMONS RESENTED AND LOUDLY COMPLAINED OF THIS AFFRONT AND THE MORE TO ENRAGE THEM THE KING HIMSELF WROTE A LETTER TO THE UNIVERSITY EXTOLLING THE DUKE
8095-274346-0039 YET LEST ANY AMBIGUITY SHOULD REMAIN SIR DUDLEY CARLETON VICE CHAMBERLAIN TOOK CARE TO EXPLAIN IT I PRAY YOU CONSIDER SAID HE WHAT THESE NEW COUNSELS ARE OR MAY BE I FEAR TO DECLARE THOSE THAT I CONCEIVE
8095-274346-0040 IN ALL CHRISTIAN KINGDOMS YOU KNOW THAT PARLIAMENTS WERE IN USE ANCIENTLY BY WHICH THOSE KINGDOMS WERE GOVERNED IN A MOST FLOURISHING MANNER UNTIL THE MONARCHS BEGAN TO KNOW THEIR OWN STRENGTH AND SEEING THE TURBULENT SPIRIT OF THEIR PARLIAMENTS AT LENGTH
8095-274346-0041 THEY BY LITTLE AND LITTLE BEGAN TO STAND ON THEIR PREROGATIVES AND AT LAST OVERTHREW THE PARLIAMENTS THROUGHOUT CHRISTENDOM
8095-274346-0042 WHICH BRINGETH SUCH HAPPINESS TO THIS NATION AND MAKES US ENVIED OF ALL OTHERS WHILE THERE IS THIS SWEETNESS BETWEEN HIS MAJESTY AND THE COMMONS LEST WE LOSE THE REPUTE OF A FREE PEOPLE BY OUR TURBULENCY IN PARLIAMENT
8095-274346-0043 THESE IMPRUDENT SUGGESTIONS RATHER GAVE WARNING THAN STRUCK TERROR A PRECARIOUS LIBERTY THE COMMONS THOUGHT WHICH WAS TO BE PRESERVED BY UNLIMITED COMPLAISANCE WAS NO LIBERTY AT ALL AND IT WAS NECESSARY WHILE YET IN THEIR POWER
8095-274346-0044 TO SECURE THE CONSTITUTION BY SUCH INVINCIBLE BARRIERS THAT NO KING OR MINISTER SHOULD EVER FOR THE FUTURE DARE TO SPEAK SUCH A LANGUAGE TO ANY PARLIAMENT OR EVEN ENTERTAIN SUCH A PROJECT AGAINST THEM
8095-274346-0045 THE COMMONS IMMEDIATELY DECLARED THAT THEY WOULD PROCEED NO FURTHER UPON BUSINESS TILL THEY HAD SATISFACTION IN THEIR PRIVILEGES CHARLES ALLEGED AS THE REASON OF THIS MEASURE CERTAIN SEDITIOUS EXPRESSIONS WHICH HE SAID HAD IN THEIR ACCUSATION OF THE DUKE
8095-274346-0046 DROPPED FROM THESE MEMBERS UPON INQUIRY IT APPEARED THAT NO SUCH EXPRESSIONS HAD BEEN USED THE MEMBERS WERE RELEASED AND THE KING REAPED NO OTHER BENEFIT FROM THIS ATTEMPT THAN TO EXASPERATE THE HOUSE STILL
8095-274346-0047 AND TO SHOW SOME DEGREE OF PRECIPITANCY AND INDISCRETION MOVED BY THIS EXAMPLE THE HOUSE OF PEERS WERE ROUSED FROM THEIR INACTIVITY AND CLAIMED LIBERTY FOR THE EARL OF ARUNDEL WHO HAD BEEN LATELY CONFINED IN THE TOWER
8095-274346-0048 AFTER MANY FRUITLESS EVASIONS THE KING
8095-274346-0049 HIS MOTHER WHO HAD GREAT INFLUENCE OVER HIM WAS A PROFESSED CATHOLIC HIS WIFE WAS NOT FREE FROM SUSPICION
8095-274346-0050 SO VIOLENT WAS THE BIGOTRY OF THE TIMES THAT IT WAS THOUGHT A SUFFICIENT REASON FOR DISQUALIFYING ANY ONE FROM HOLDING AN OFFICE
8095-274346-0051 THIS ARTICLE TOGETHER WITH THE NEW IMPOSITIONS LAID ON MERCHANDISE BY JAMES CONSTITUTED NEAR HALF OF THE CROWN REVENUES AND BY DEPRIVING THE KING OF THESE RESOURCES THEY WOULD HAVE REDUCED HIM TO TOTAL SUBJECTION AND DEPENDENCE
8095-274346-0052 WHILE THEY RETAINED SUCH A PLEDGE BESIDES THE SUPPLY ALREADY PROMISED THEY WERE SURE THAT NOTHING COULD BE REFUSED THEM THOUGH AFTER CANVASSING THE MATTER NEAR THREE NINTHS THEY FOUND THEMSELVES UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF FIXING ANY LEGAL CRIME UPON THE DUKE
8095-274346-0053 THE SMALLEST APPEARANCE OF GUILT COULD NOT BE FIXED UPON HIM WHAT IDEA HE ASKED MUST ALL MANKIND ENTERTAIN OF HIS HONOR SHOULD HE SACRIFICE HIS INNOCENT FRIEND TO PECUNIARY CONSIDERATIONS WHAT FURTHER AUTHORITY SHOULD HE RETAIN IN THE NATION
8095-274346-0054 WERE HE CAPABLE IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN TO GIVE IN SO SIGNAL AN INSTANCE SUCH MATTER OF TRIUMPH TO HIS ENEMIES AND DISCOURAGEMENT TO HIS ADHERENTS TO DAY THE COMMONS PRETEND TO WREST HIS MINISTER FROM HIM
8095-274346-0055 TO MORROW THEY WILL ATTACK SOME BRANCH OF HIS PREROGATIVE BY THEIR REMONSTRANCES AND PROMISES AND PROTESTATIONS THEY HAD ENGAGED THE CROWN IN A WAR AS SOON AS THEY SAW A RETREAT IMPOSSIBLE
8095-274346-0056 WITHOUT WAITING FOR NEW INCIDENTS WITHOUT COVERING THEMSELVES WITH NEW PRETENCES THEY IMMEDIATELY DESERTED HIM AND REFUSED HIM ALL REASONABLE SUPPLY IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THEY DESIRED NOTHING SO MUCH AS TO SEE HIM PLUNGED IN INEXTRICABLE DIFFICULTIES
8095-274346-0057 OF WHICH THEY INTENDED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE TO SUCH DEEP PERFIDY TO SUCH UNBOUNDED USURPATIONS IT WAS NECESSARY TO OPPOSE A PROPER FIRMNESS AND RESOLUTION
8095-274348-0000 AND WHO FROM A PRIVATE STATION HAD MOUNTED IN THE EARLIEST YOUTH
8095-274348-0001 HE DARED TO CARRY HIS AMBITIOUS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN HERSELF AND HE FAILED NOT TO MAKE IMPRESSION ON A HEART NOT UNDISPOSED TO THE TENDER PASSIONS THAT ATTACHMENT AT LEAST OF THE MIND WHICH APPEARS SO DELICIOUS AND IS SO DANGEROUS
8095-274348-0002 SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ENCOURAGED BY THE PRINCESS AND THE DUKE PRESUMED SO FAR ON HER GOOD GRACES THAT AFTER HIS DEPARTURE HE SECRETLY RETURNED UPON SOME PRETENCE AND PAYING A VISIT TO THE QUEEN
8095-274348-0003 WAS DISMISSED WITH A REPROOF WHICH SAVORED MORE OF KINDNESS THAN OF ANGER INFORMATION OF THIS CORRESPONDENCE WAS SOON CARRIED TO RICHELIEU THE VIGILANCE OF THAT MINISTER WAS HERE FURTHER ROUSED BY JEALOUSY
8095-274348-0004 HE TOO EITHER FROM VANITY OR POLITICS HAD VENTURED TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN BUT A PRIEST PAST MIDDLE AGE OF A SEVERE CHARACTER AND OCCUPIED IN THE MOST EXTENSIVE PLANS OF AMBITION OR VENGEANCE
8095-274348-0005 ENTIRELY DISPOSED TO GAYETY AND GALLANTRY THE CARDINAL'S DISAPPOINTMENT STRONGLY INCLINED HIM TO COUNTERWORK THE AMOROUS PROJECTS OF HIS RIVAL WHEN THE DUKE WAS MAKING PREPARATIONS FOR A NEW EMBASSY TO PARIS
8095-274348-0006 A MESSAGE WAS SENT HIM FROM LOUIS THAT HE MUST NOT THINK OF SUCH A JOURNEY IN A ROMANTIC PASSION HE SWORE THAT HE WOULD SEE THE QUEEN IN SPITE OF ALL THE POWER OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0007 AND FROM THAT MOMENT HE DETERMINED TO ENGAGE ENGLAND IN A WAR WITH THAT KINGDOM HE FIRST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF SOME QUARRELS EXCITED BY THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND'S ATTENDANTS AND HE PERSUADED CHARLES TO DISMISS AT ONCE ALL HER FRENCH SERVANTS
8095-274348-0008 CONTRARY TO THE ARTICLES OF THE MARRIAGE TREATY HE ENCOURAGED THE ENGLISH SHIPS OF WAR AND PRIVATEERS TO SEIZE VESSELS BELONGING TO FRENCH MERCHANTS
8095-274348-0009 AND STRONGLY SOLICITED CHARLES TO EMBRACE THE PROTECTION OF THESE DISTRESSED RELIGIONISTS HE REPRESENTED THAT AFTER THE INHABITANTS OF ROCHELLE HAD BEEN REPRESSED BY THE COMBINED SQUADRONS OF ENGLAND AND HOLLAND
8095-274348-0010 AFTER PEACE WAS CONCLUDED WITH THE FRENCH KING UNDER CHARLES'S MEDIATION THE AMBITIOUS CARDINAL WAS STILL MEDITATING THE DESTRUCTION OF THE HUGONOTS THAT PREPARATIONS WERE SILENTLY MAKING IN EVERY PROVINCE OF FRANCE FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THEIR RELIGION
8095-274348-0011 THAT FORTS WERE ERECTED IN ORDER TO BRIDLE ROCHELLE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE BULWARK OF THE PROTESTANTS THAT THE REFORMED IN FRANCE CAST THEIR EYES ON CHARLES AS THE HEAD OF THEIR FAITH
8095-274348-0012 AND CONSIDERED HIM AS A PRINCE ENGAGED BY INTEREST AS WELL AS INCLINATION TO SUPPORT THEM THAT SO LONG AS THEIR PARTY SUBSISTED CHARLES MIGHT RELY ON THEIR ATTACHMENT AS MUCH AS ON THAT OF HIS OWN SUBJECTS BUT IF THEIR LIBERTIES WERE ONCE RAVISHED FROM THEM
8095-274348-0013 THE POWER OF FRANCE FREED FROM THIS IMPEDIMENT WOULD SOON BECOME FORMIDABLE TO ENGLAND AND TO ALL THE NEIGHBORING NATIONS THOUGH CHARLES PROBABLY BORE BUT SMALL FAVOR TO THE HUGONOTS WHO SO MUCH RESEMBLED THE PURITANS IN DISCIPLINE AND WORSHIP
8095-274348-0014 IN RELIGION AND POLITICS HE YET ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE GAINED BY THESE ARGUMENTS ENFORCED BY THE SOLICITATIONS OF BUCKINGHAM A FLEET OF A HUNDRED SAIL AND AN ARMY OF SEVEN THOUSAND MEN WERE FITTED OUT FOR THE INVASION OF FRANCE
8095-274348-0015 AND BOTH OF THEM INTRUSTED TO THE COMMAND OF THE DUKE WHO WAS ALTOGETHER UNACQUAINTED BOTH WITH LAND AND SEA SERVICE THE FLEET APPEARED BEFORE ROCHELLE BUT SO ILL CONCERTED WERE BUCKINGHAM'S MEASURES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THAT CITY
8095-274348-0016 SHUT THEIR GATES AND REFUSED TO ADMIT ALLIES OF WHOSE COMING THEY WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INFORMED
8095-274348-0017 HASTENED THE VENGEANCE OF THEIR MASTER EXHAUSTED THEIR PROVISIONS IN SUPPLYING THEIR ALLIES AND WERE THREATENED WITH AN IMMEDIATE SIEGE
8098-275181-0000 THEIR SHARP CUR LIKE BARKS USED OFTEN TO ROUSE US AND OF A DARK EVENING WE WOULD HEAR THEM OUT IN THE FIELDS MOUSING AROUND THE STONE HEAPS MAKING A QUEER SQUEAKING SOUND LIKE A MOUSE
8098-275181-0001 TO CALL THE REAL MICE OUT OF THEIR GRASS NESTS INSIDE THE STONE HEAPS THIS INDEED IS A FAVORITE TRICK OF REYNARD AT THE TIME OF MY STORY MY FRIEND TOM EDWARDS TEN YEARS OF AGE
8098-275181-0002 AND MYSELF WERE IN THE TURKEY BUSINESS EQUAL PARTNERS WE OWNED A FLOCK OF THIRTY ONE TURKEYS THESE ROOSTED BY NIGHT IN A LARGE BUTTERNUT TREE IN FRONT OF TOM'S HOUSE IN THE VERY TOP OF IT
8098-275181-0003 AND BY DAY THEY WANDERED ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE CLEARINGS IN QUEST OF BEECH NUTS WHICH WERE VERY PLENTIFUL THAT FALL ALL WENT WELL TILL THE LAST WEEK IN OCTOBER WHEN ON TAKING THE CENSUS ONE MORNING A TURKEY WAS FOUND TO BE MISSING
8098-275181-0004 THE THIRTY ONE HAD BECOME THIRTY SINCE NIGHTFALL THE PREVIOUS EVENING IT WAS THE FIRST ONE WE HAD LOST WE PROCEEDED TO LOOK FOR TRACES OUR SUSPICIONS WERE DIVIDED
8098-275181-0005 TOM THOUGHT IT WAS THE TWOMBLY BOYS NEFARIOUS SAM IN PARTICULAR I THOUGHT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN OWL BUT UNDER THE TREE IN THE SOFT DIRT WHERE THE POTATOES HAD RECENTLY BEEN DUG WE FOUND FOX TRACKS
8098-275181-0006 AND TWO OR THREE OMINOUS LITTLE WADS OF FEATHERS WITH ONE LONG TAIL FEATHER ADRIFT THEREUPON WE CONCLUDED THAT THE TURKEY HAD ACCIDENTALLY FALLEN DOWN OUT OF THE BUTTERNUT HAD A FIT PERHAPS
8098-275181-0007 AND A CASUALTY SUCH AS TURKEY RAISERS ARE UNAVOIDABLY HEIRS TO AND WE BORE OUR LOSS WITH RESIGNATION WE WERE GLAD TO REMEMBER THAT TURKEYS DID NOT OFTEN FALL OFF THEIR ROOSTS
8098-275181-0008 THIS THEORY RECEIVED SOMETHING OF A CHECK WHEN OUR FLOCK COUNTED ONLY TWENTY NINE THE NEXT MORNING THERE WERE MORE FOX TRACKS AND A GREAT MANY MORE FEATHERS UNDER THE TREE THIS PUT A NEW AND ALTOGETHER UGLY ASPECT ON THE MATTER
8098-275181-0009 NO ALGEBRA WAS NEEDED TO FIGURE THE OUTCOME OF THE TURKEY BUSINESS AT THIS RATE TOGETHER WITH OUR PROSPECTIVE PROFITS IN THE LIGHT OF THIS NEW FACT IT WAS CLEAR THAT SOMETHING MUST BE DONE AND AT ONCE TOO
8098-275181-0010 OR RUIN WOULD SWALLOW UP THE POULTRY FIRM RIGHTLY OR WRONGLY WE ATTRIBUTED THE MISCHIEF TO A CERTAIN SILVER GRAY THAT HAD SEVERAL TIMES BEEN SEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT AUTUMN
8098-275181-0011 IT WOULD TAKE FAR TOO MUCH SPACE TO RELATE IN DETAIL THE PLANS WE LAID AND PUT IN EXECUTION TO CATCH THAT FOX DURING THE NEXT TWO WEEKS I RECOLLECT THAT WE SET THREE TRAPS FOR HIM TO NO PURPOSE
8098-275181-0012 HAD SUCCEEDED IN GETTING TWO MORE OF THE TURKEYS HEROES IT IS SAID ARE BORN OF GREAT CRISES THIS DILEMMA OF OURS DEVELOPED TOM'S GENIUS I'LL HAVE THAT FOX HE SAID WHEN THE TRAPS FAILED
8098-275181-0013 EACH A WAD OF FINE DRY GRASS AS LARGE AS A QUART BOX THESE WERE GATHERED UP AND FILLED THE GREAT BASKET THERE SAID HE TRIUMPHANTLY DON'T THEM SMELL MOUSEY THEY DID CERTAINLY
8098-275181-0014 THEY SAVORED AS STRONGLY OF MICE AS TOM'S QUESTION OF BAD GRAMMAR AND DON'T FOXES CATCH MICE DEMANDED TOM CONFIDENTLY YES BUT I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S GOING TO CATCH THE FOX I SAID
8098-275181-0015 WELL LOOK HERE THEN I'LL SHOW YE SAID HE
8098-275181-0016 AND YOU WAS PROWLING AROUND THE FIELDS GO OFF NOW OUT THERE BY THAT STUMP FULL OF WONDER AND CURIOSITY I RETIRED TO THE STUMP TOM MEANTIME TURNED OUT THE MASS OF NESTS
8098-275181-0017 AND WITH IT COMPLETELY COVERED HIMSELF THE PILE NOW RESEMBLED AN ENORMOUS MOUSE NEST OR RATHER A SMALL HAY COCK
8098-275181-0018 INSIDE THE NEST EVIDENTLY THERE WERE MICE IN IT AND FEELING MY CHARACTER AS FOX AT STAKE I AT ONCE TROTTED FORWARD THEN CREPT UP AND AS THE RUSTLING AND SQUEAKING CONTINUED MADE A POUNCE INTO THE GRASS
8098-275181-0019 AS I HAD HEARD IT SAID THAT FOXES DID WHEN MOUSING INSTANTLY TWO SPRY BROWN HANDS FROM OUT THE NEST CLUTCHED ME WITH A MOST VENGEFUL GRIP AS A FOX I STRUGGLED TREMENDOUSLY
8098-275181-0020 THEN IN DUMB SHOW KNOCKED MY HEAD WITH A STONE D'YE SEE NOW HE DEMANDED I SAW BUT A FOX WOULD BITE YOU I OBJECTED LET HIM BITE SAID TOM
8098-275181-0021 WITH THE DUSK WE STOLE OUT INTO THE FIELD WHERE THE STONE HEAPS WERE AND WHERE WE HAD OFTENEST HEARD FOXES BARK SELECTING A NOOK IN THE EDGE OF A CLUMP OF RASPBERRY BRIARS WHICH GREW ABOUT A GREAT PINE STUMP
8098-275181-0022 TOM LAY DOWN AND I COVERED HIM UP COMPLETELY WITH THE CONTENTS OF THE BIG BASKET HE THEN PRACTICED SQUEAKING AND RUSTLING SEVERAL TIMES TO BE SURE THAT ALL WAS IN GOOD TRIM HIS SQUEAKS WERE PERFECT SUCCESSES
8098-275181-0023 MADE BY SUCKING THE AIR SHARPLY BETWIXT HIS TEETH NOW BE OFF SAID TOM AND DON'T COME POKING AROUND NOR GET IN SIGHT TILL YOU HEAR ME HOLLER
8098-275181-0024 AND BEING AMIDST NICE COZY STRAW I PRESENTLY WENT TO SLEEP QUITE UNINTENTIONALLY I MUST HAVE SLEPT SOME TIME THOUGH IT SEEMED TO ME BUT A VERY FEW MINUTES WHAT WOKE ME WAS A NOISE A SHARP SUPPRESSED YELP
8098-275181-0025 IT TOOK ME A MOMENT TO UNDERSTAND WHERE I WAS AND WHY I WAS THERE A SOUND OF SCUFFLING AND TUMBLING ON THE GROUND AT SOME DISTANCE ASSISTED MY WANDERING WITS AND I RUSHED OUT OF THE BARN AND RAN TOWARD THE FIELD
8098-275181-0026 AS I RAN TWO OR THREE DULL WHACKS CAME TO MY EAR GOT HIM TOM I SHOUTED RUSHING UP TOM WAS HOLDING AND SQUEEZING ONE OF HIS HANDS WITH THE OTHER AND SHAKING IT VIOLENTLY
8098-275181-0027 HE SAID NOT A WORD AND LEFT ME TO POKE ABOUT AND STUMBLE ON THE LIMP WARM CARCASS OF A LARGE FOX THAT LAY NEAR BITE YE I EXCLAIMED AFTER SATISFYING MYSELF THAT THE FOX WAS DEAD SOME SAID TOM
8098-275181-0028 AND THAT WAS ALL I COULD GET FROM HIM THAT NIGHT WE TOOK THE FOX TO THE HOUSE AND LIGHTED A CANDLE IT WAS THE SILVER GRAY TOM WASHED HIS BITE IN COLD WATER AND WENT TO BED
8098-275181-0029 HIS LEFT HAND WAS BITTEN THROUGH THE PALM AND BADLY SWOLLEN THERE WAS ALSO A DEEP BITE IN THE FLESHY PART OF HIS RIGHT ARM JUST BELOW THE ELBOW SEVERAL MINOR NIPS IN HIS LEFT LEG ABOVE THE KNEE AND A RAGGED GRAB
8098-275181-0030 THESE NUMEROUS BITES HOWEVER WERE FOLLOWED BY NO SERIOUS ILL EFFECTS THE NEXT DAY TOM TOLD ME THAT THE FOX HAD SUDDENLY PLUNGED INTO THE GRASS THAT HE HAD CAUGHT HOLD OF ONE OF ITS HIND LEGS
8098-275181-0031 I JUST DETERMINED TO HAVE IT OUT WITH HIM CONSIDERING THE FACT THAT A FOX IS A VERY ACTIVE SHARP BITING ANIMAL AND THAT THIS WAS AN UNUSUALLY LARGE MALE I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT TOM GOT OFF VERY WELL
8098-275181-0032 I DO NOT THINK THAT HE EVER CARED TO MAKE A FOX TRAP OF HIMSELF AGAIN HOWEVER WE SOLD THE FOX SKIN IN THE VILLAGE AND RECEIVED THIRTEEN DOLLARS FOR IT WHEREAS A COMMON RED FOX SKIN IS WORTH NO MORE THAN THREE DOLLARS
8098-275181-0033 HOW OR BY WHAT WILES THAT FOX GOT THE TURKEYS OUT OF THE HIGH BUTTERNUT IS A SECRET
8098-278252-0000 MUCH POMP AND SEVERAL CIRCUMSTANCES FROM WILLOUGHBY WE WENT TO CLEVELAND MY ROUTE THROUGH THE BEAUTIFUL CITY LAY ALONG ONE OF THE FINEST RESIDENCE STREETS IN AMERICA THE FAMOUS EUCLID AVENUE
8098-278252-0001 FROM THERE WE MARCHED TO SUPERIOR STREET WHERE CHEERS GREETED US ON EVERY HAND THE PAPERS HAD HERALDED MY ADVENT AND AS IN THE OTHER TOWNS AND CITIES
8098-278252-0002 THE NEWSPAPER ARTISTS HAD TAXED THEIR IMAGINATIONS TO PICTURE POD AND MAC
8098-278252-0003 AND WHEN I RODE OUT ON TO THE STAGE THE HOUSE SHOOK WITH LAUGHTER AND CHEERS I MADE A SHORT ADDRESS AND ANNOUNCED THAT I WOULD SELL PHOTOS OF MAC A'RONY AND HIS MASTER AT THE DOOR
8098-278252-0004 THAT THEATRE PUT ME WAY AHEAD FINANCIALLY THURSDAY MORNING I CALLED ON THE MAYOR MARK HANNA AND SENATOR GARFIELD AND ADDED THE AUTOGRAPHS OF ALL THREE TO MY ALBUM
8098-278252-0005 MISTER GARFIELD INVITED ME TO ATTEND THE WEEKLY DINNER AND RECEPTION OF THE BEER AND SKITTLES CLUB THAT EVENING I WENT AND ENJOYED MYSELF
8098-278252-0006 ONLY MAKING THIRTEEN MILES
8098-278252-0007 A MILE BEYOND TWO MEN REMINDED ME IT WAS A VERY WINTRY DAY THEN A WOMAN DROVE PAST AND TOSSED ME THE COMFORTING REMINDER DON'T YOU FIND IT AWFULLY COLD I DID NOT REPLY TO THE LAST TWO
8098-278252-0008 TWENTY MINUTES LATER A BOY FROM A COZY HOME YELLED TO ME I HAD PASSED TO SOME DISTANCE AND DID NOT UNDERSTAND IT SOUNDED LIKE
8098-278252-0009 I HESITATED A MOMENT IN THE BITING WIND THEN RETRACED MY STEPS AND CALLED TO THE LAD WHAT'S THAT YOU SAID
8098-278252-0010 YELLED THE SCAMP I WAS MAD ENOUGH TO UNLOAD MY WINCHESTER BUT I DIDN'T
8098-278252-0011 RUBBED MY EARS AND CONTINUED MY JOURNEY LIKE AN ICE COVERED VOLCANO A MILE BEYOND A WAGON WITH A FAMILY IN IT PASSED ME AND THE MAN SAID COLD MY FRIEND AT DUSK A FARMER INQUIRED
8098-278252-0012 I SHOUTED SEVERAL TIMES BEFORE THE RIG STOPPED A FUR CLAD HEAD STUCK OUT TO ONE SIDE AND A MALE VOICE CALLED
8098-278252-0013 I AMBLED UP PUT A FOOT ON THE HUB OF A WHEEL AND SAID I SIMPLY WANT TO SAY IT'S A COLD DAY YOU AS SOON AS HE HAD FINISHED I SAID BY WAY OF CIVIL EXPLANATION
8098-278252-0014 MY DEAR SIR DO YOU KNOW A HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE STOPPED ME TO DAY AND TOLD ME IT IS COLD I HAVE TRAMPED NEARLY TWENTY MILES WITHOUT STOPPING TO WARM OR EAT
8098-278252-0015 AND I RESOLVED TO LET THE NEXT FELLOW HAVE THE SAME DOSE I HAVE BEEN TAKING HALF HOURLY ALL DAY NOW IF YOU ARE SATISFIED THAT IT IS A COLD DAY I WILL BID YOU GOOD NIGHT
8098-278252-0016 WITH THIS I RETURNED TO MY COMPANIONS SOMEWHAT WARMER PHYSICALLY BUT COOLER IN SPIRIT THE HOTEL IN CUYAHOGA FALLS RECEIVED US MOST HOSPITABLY
8098-278252-0017 I NEVER SHALL FORGET THE KINDNESSES OF ITS LANDLADY THE VILLAGE DATES BACK TO PIONEER DAYS IT IS BUILT ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE OLD CUYAHOGA INDIANS MONDAY MARCH FIRST AT TWELVE THIRTY P M
8098-278252-0018 WAVING HATS AND ARMS AND CALLING TO ME TO BE THEIR GUEST I WAS PUZZLED TO KNOW WHICH INVITATION TO ACCEPT WHILE DELIBERATING ONE OF THE LANDLORDS APPROACHED AND TAKING MY ARM LED ME TO HIS COMFORTABLE HOSTELRY
8098-278252-0019 WHERE HE ROYALLY ENTERTAINED ME AND MY ANIMALS THE PAGEANT THAT CELEBRATED THE DEPARTURE OF WILLIAM MC KINLEY TO THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT WAS A FAIR ESTIMATE OF THE REGARD IN WHICH HIS FELLOW CITIZENS HELD HIM

8098-278252-0028 I FOUND THE STORE FULL OF LOUNGERS WHO PATRONIZED THE CHAIRS SOAP AND STARCH BOXES MACKEREL KITS AND COUNTER FORMING A SILENT CIRCLE ROUND A TOWERING STOVE IN THE CENTER
8098-278252-0029 THE VILLAGE TREASURER WORE A BOILED SHIRT AND BRASS COLLAR BUTTONS BUT NO COLLAR OR COAT HIS COMPANIONS WERE GENERALLY ATTIRED IN FLANNEL SHIRTS OF DIFFERENT HUES AND PATTERNS

8098-278252-0039 SOMETHING WITHIN WAS SIZZLING AND BREWING AND STEAMING GAS AND STEAM CHOKED ME I WAS SURE THERE WAS GOING TO BE A DEMONSTRATION IN MY HONOR THAT I HAD NOT BARGAINED FOR THE YEAST CAKE CAME TO MIND THEN I KNEW THE CAUSE
8098-278252-0040 AFTER WHICH I EXCUSED MYSELF TO THE CLERK AND WENT TO BED AND DREAMED I WAS BEING CREMATED ALIVE
8098-278278-0000 BY MAC A'RONY YOU DO ILL TO TEACH THE CHILD SUCH WORDS HE TEACHES HIM TO KICK AND TO HACK WHICH THEY'LL DO FAST ENOUGH OF THEMSELVES AND TO CALL HORUM FYE UPON YOU
8098-278278-0001 MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR FREQUENTLY SINCE CROSSING THE MISSISSIPPI POD HAD RECEIVED LETTERS FROM PROUD PARENTS INFORMING HIM THAT THEY HAD NAMED THEIR LATEST BOY AFTER HIM
8098-278278-0002 AT THAT TIME IN CRIPPLE CREEK SEVERAL BOYS RANGING FROM A DAY TO SIX WEEKS OLD WHOSE DESTINIES WERE THOUGHT TO BE PROMISING WERE AFFLICTED WITH MY MASTER'S PONDEROUS NAME
8098-278278-0003 A LITTLE GREEN EYED IRISH GIRL FIVE DAYS OLD WAS NAMED PYTHAGORINA PODINA MULGARRY
8098-278278-0004 THE HAPPY FATHER CALLED PERSONALLY ON POD AND ASKED HIM TO ACT AS GODFATHER AT THE BAPTISMAL SERVICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THE IMPRESSIVE CEREMONY TOOK PLACE AT THE CABIN OF MISS PYTHAGORINA
8098-278278-0005 AS THE AGED GRANDMOTHER WISHED TO WITNESS IT POD SAID HE WAS SOMEWHAT EMBARRASSED ABOUT ATTENDING SINCE HE HAD FORGOTTEN ALMOST ALL HIS LATIN
8098-278278-0006 BUT HE ARRANGED WITH ONE OF THE PALL BEARERS TO GIVE HIM NUDGES AND KICKS WHEN IT WAS EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE A RESPONSE AND SO HE GOT THROUGH FAIRLY WELL BETTER THAN THE KID DID HE SAID THE BABE WAS AN UNRULY CHILD
8098-278278-0007 AND KICKED SO FRANTICALLY WHEN THE PRIEST TOOK HER IN HIS ARMS THAT TWO FLATIRONS WERE TIED TO ITS FEET TO KEEP THEM DOWN IT WAS SIMPLY NERVOUSNESS BECAUSE THE HIGH ALTITUDE AFFECTED THE CHILD'S NERVES
8098-278278-0008 THERE WAS GREAT EXCITEMENT AND SURPRISE BECAUSE THE FLATIRONS DIDN'T FLOAT AND THE UNDERTAKER OR WHAT YOU CALL EM OVERTURNED THE BARREL OF WATER AND SET EVERYBODY AFLOAT DRENCHING THE SPONSORS AND GUESTS
8098-278278-0009 POD SAID THE SCENE WAS WITHOUT A PARALLEL HE WAS SOAKED TO HIS EQUATOR THE HALF CHRISTENED HALF DROWNED PYTHAGORINA PODINA WAS PICKED UP FROM THE FLOOD WITH A TABLESPOON AND THE CEREMONY FINISHED
8098-278278-0010 THEN SHE WAS ROLLED ON THE BARREL TO GET ALL THE WATER OUT OF HER AND PUT TO BED WITH HOT FLATIRONS AT HER FEET TO PREVENT CROUP AND MUMPS THEN THE WAKE BROKE UP I DON'T BELIEVE THE CHILD UNDERSTOOD A WORD THAT THE PRIEST SAID
8098-278278-0011 POD DIDN'T THAT NIGHT HE GOT UP A FINE SUPPER AND INVITED SOME OLD FRIENDS HE BOUGHT A BIG PORTERHOUSE STEAK THICK AND TENDER AND PERSONALLY BROILED IT ON HIS PATENT FOLDING STOVE
8098-278278-0012 JUST WHEN EVERYTHING WAS ON THE TABLE AND THE GUESTS WERE FINDING STONES AND TIN PLATES TO SIT ON DON NOT HAVING HAD A THING TO EAT FOR AN HOUR COOLLY PULLED THE HOT STEAK OFF THE PLATTER AND DROPPED IT ON THE GROUND
8098-278278-0013 POD DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING THOUGH BUT JUST FORKED IT ON TO THE PLATTER AND SCRAPED OFF SOME DRY GRASS AND A SLIVER AND A BUG AND CARVED IT UP
8098-278278-0014 THE LADIES LOOKED AT THE DOG AND THEN AT POD NOT KNOWING WHICH TO THANK THEN FEELING SENSITIVE ABOUT ACCEPTING THE BEST PART OF THE STEAK INSISTED UPON POD'S HAVING ONE OF THEIR PIECES AND COONSKIN THE OTHER
8098-278278-0015 AFTER SUPPER DON FEASTED ON THE TOUGHER PARTS OF THE STEAK AND WE DONKS WERE FED THE SCRAPS OF POTATOES AND BREAD AND TIN TOMATO AND PEACH CANS WHEN THE BANQUET WAS OVER THE GUESTS WENT HOME
8098-278278-0016 ABOUT SIX O'CLOCK WE WENT INTO CAMP ON THE MARGIN OF A FAMOUS PETRIFIED FOREST POD OBJECTED AT FIRST BECAUSE OF THE SCARCITY OF FIRE WOOD
8098-278278-0017 LOTS OF PETRIFIED WOOD CHIPS LYING AROUND I REMARKED AND THEY'LL LAST ORDINARY WOOD BURNS UP TOO FAST BRIGHT IDEA EXCLAIMED POD AND COONSKIN WENT TO WORK GATHERING PETRIFIED WOOD FOR THE SUPPER FIRE
8098-278278-0018 THE ONLY TROUBLE WILL BE IN STARTING THE FIRE SAID POD JUST AS SOON AS IT'S ONCE GOING IT OUGHT TO BURN SMOOTHLY ENOUGH
8098-278278-0019 COONSKIN'S OPINION DIDN'T BENEFIT POD MUCH HIS HARD WOOD FIRE WASN'T VERY SATISFACTORY BUT WITH SOME DRY BRUSH THE MEN GOT THE MEAL UNDER WAY NEXT MORNING WE VISITED THE NOTED PETRIFIED STUMP
8098-278278-0020 MEASURING UPWARDS OF FORTY FIVE FEET IN CIRCUMFERENCE SEVERAL SAWS WERE IMBEDDED IN IT FOR MANY FUTILE ATTEMPTS HAD BEEN MADE TO TAKE OFF SOME SLICES FOR THE DENVER EXPOSITION
8098-278278-0021 IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED BY VARIOUS ORNITHOLOGISTS BOTANISTS AND ENTOMOLOGISTS THAT THE STUMP IS MILLIONS OF YEARS OLD I THINK THEY WERE GUESSING AT IT FOR I COULDN'T SEE THE RINGS
8098-278278-0022 SEVERAL TIMES I HAD A SUSPICION THAT WE HAD BEEN MISDIRECTED WHEN WE CAME TO THE END OF A NARROW WOOD ROAD I WAS SURE OF IT
8098-278278-0023 BEST TO GO THROUGH THE WOODS SAID THE VALET SO WE WERE HEADED FOR THE TIMBER OUR TRAMP THROUGH THE FOREST I CANNOT SOON FORGET UP AND DOWN THE ROCKY HEIGHTS THROUGH THICKETS OF QUAKING ASP AND PINE
8098-278278-0024 AND REALIZED WE WERE LOST COONSKIN SAID HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED WOODMAN AND WOULD BLAZE THE TREES SO WE WOULD GET OUT AGAIN WONDERFUL THE AMOUNT OF LEARNING HE HAD GLEANED FROM DIME NOVELS
8098-278278-0025 HE LAGGED BEHIND TO DO THE BLAZING AND PRETTY SOON I SMELT SMOKE THE PROFESSOR SNUFFED SMELLS AS IF THE WOODS WERE ON FIRE SOMEWHERE HINTED POD LOOK BEHIND YOU THEY ARE I EXCLAIMED
8098-278278-0026 AND POD CAUGHT THAT ERUDITE VALET BACK WOODSMAN IN THE ACT OF SETTING A TREE ON FIRE WITH OIL AND MATCHES FORTUNATELY FOR US THE WIND WASN'T BLOWING STRONG
8098-278278-0027 BUT WE HAD TO CHANGE OUR COURSE SOME AND HUSTLE FASTER FOR THE BLAZING TRAIL CHASED US COONSKIN LEARNED A NEW LESSON AND TURNED DOWN THE CORNER OF THE PAGE SO HE'D RECOLLECT IT
8098-278278-0028 A BOARD SIGN INFORMED US IT WAS SIMPLY TURKEY CREEK I COULDN'T SEE ANY TURKEYS BUT THERE WAS GOOD PASTURAGE AROUND THE HOT TRIP THROUGH THE TIMBER MADE US ALL HUNGRY
8098-278278-0029 IT WAS THREE O'CLOCK WHEN WE DONKS WERE PICKETED AND ALLOWED TO GRAZE THEN COONSKIN WENT FISHING HE SAID HE HAD SEEN SOME TROUT IN THE STREAM BY SUPPER TIME HE HAD CAUGHT A NICE MESS
8098-278278-0030 POD SAID HE WOULD FRY THE FISH AND WENT AT IT SO ENTHUSIASTICALLY THAT HE FORGOT TO PUT THE BAG OF CORN MEAL BACK IN ITS PLACE AFTER THE MEAL WAS OVER HE BEGAN TO LOOK AROUND FOR THE BAG IT WAS NOWHERE TO BE FOUND
8098-278278-0031 I HAD EATEN THE CORN MEAL AND BAG IT WAS COMICAL HOW THOSE TWO MEN PUZZLED THEIR BRAINS ABOUT THAT MISSING COMMODITY WHEN COONSKIN DETECTED SOME MEAL STAMPED IN THE GROUND POD POINTED AT ME AND SAID
8098-278278-0032 THAT'S THE THIEF THERE NEXT MORNING COONSKIN WAS THE FIRST TO RETURN FROM FISHING AND LOOKED MUCH EXCITED WHEN POD RETURNED HE TOLD HIM HE HAD SEEN HUGE BEAR TRACKS HE WAS GOING BEAR HUNTING POD LAUGHED AT HIM
8098-278278-0033 THAT WAS MY EXPERIENCE IN THE WOODS OF WISCONSIN THE MEN AT THE SAW MILL SAID WE SHOULD SEE BEAR IN THIS FOREST
8098-278278-0034 ITS SKIN WOULD FETCH FIFTY DOLLARS OR MORE LET'S LOOK FOR BEAR WHAT WOULD YOU DO IF YOU SAW A BEAR POD ASKED WELL NOW LEAVE THAT TO ME SAID COONSKIN
8098-278278-0035 IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD BE WORTH A HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE TO SEE ONE WILD I'VE ONLY SEEN BEARS IN CIRCUSES OR TRAVELING CHAINED TO ITALIANS IN THE SECOND PLACE I CAN RUN I'VE PLENTY OF MEDALS FOR SPRINTING
8098-278278-0036 POD WENT FISHING THAT AFTERNOON WITH A GUN AND TOOK THE WHOLE ARSENAL ALONG WITH HIM INCLUDING THE AXE SOMEWHERE ABOUT FIVE O'CLOCK POD CAME INTO CAMP WITH A GOOD MESS OF TROUT AFTER CLEANING THE FISH HE TOOK OFF HIS GUNS
8098-278278-0037 AND LAID DOWN ON THE GRASS AND WONDERED IF THAT CRAZY VALET HAD RUN ACROSS ANY MORE BEAR TRACKS HE WASN'T THERE LONG WHEN SUDDENLY I HEARD YELLS ISSUING FROM THE CANYON DOWN STREAM ROUND THE BEND
8098-278278-0038 THE SHOUTING SOUNDED NEARER EVERY SECOND AND I SOON DISTINGUISHED COONSKIN'S VOICE POD GOT UP FROM THE GROUND EXCITEDLY COONSKIN'S IN TROUBLE PLAIN ENOUGH SAID POD ALOUD TO HIMSELF I MUST RUN TO HIS AID
8098-278278-0039 SO HE STARTED ON A TROT DOWN STREAM TO THE BEND AND THEN QUICKLY TURNED FALLING ALL OVER HIMSELF AND RAN TOWARD THE CABINS FASTER THAN I EVER SAW HIM RUN BEFORE OR SINCE
8098-278278-0040 AND IMMEDIATELY COONSKIN CAME FLYING INTO VIEW WITH THE BIGGEST BEAR AT HIS HEELS I EVER WANT TO SEE
8108-274318-0000 IT ALL SEEMED SO RAPID AND UNCALCULATED AFTER THAT THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE IN THIS LITTLE MODERN ROOM AT THE TOP OF PUTNEY HILL BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE THAT DOCTOR SILENCE WAS HARDLY ABLE TO FOLLOW AND REMEMBER IT ALL
8108-274318-0001 IT CAME ABOUT WITH SUCH UNCANNY SWIFTNESS AND TERROR THE LIGHT WAS SO UNCERTAIN THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BLACK CAT SO DIFFICULT TO FOLLOW ON THE DARK CARPET AND THE DOCTOR HIMSELF SO WEARY AND TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT HE FOUND IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
8108-274318-0002 TO OBSERVE ACCURATELY OR TO RECALL AFTERWARDS PRECISELY WHAT IT WAS HE HAD SEEN OR IN WHAT ORDER THE INCIDENTS HAD TAKEN PLACE HE NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND WHAT DEFECT OF VISION ON HIS PART MADE IT SEEM AS THOUGH THE CAT HAD DUPLICATED ITSELF AT FIRST
8108-274318-0003 AND THEN INCREASED INDEFINITELY SO THAT THERE WERE AT LEAST A DOZEN OF THEM DARTING SILENTLY ABOUT THE FLOOR LEAPING SOFTLY ON TO CHAIRS AND TABLES PASSING LIKE SHADOWS FROM THE OPEN DOOR TO THE END OF THE ROOM ALL BLACK AS SIN
8108-274318-0004 WITH BRILLIANT GREEN EYES FLASHING FIRE IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS LIKE THE REFLECTIONS FROM A SCORE OF MIRRORS PLACED ROUND THE WALLS AT DIFFERENT ANGLES NOR COULD HE MAKE OUT AT THE TIME WHY THE SIZE OF THE ROOM SEEMED TO HAVE ALTERED
8108-274318-0005 THE SNARLING OF THE ENRAGED AND TERRIFIED COLLIE SOUNDED SOMETIMES SO FAR AWAY THE CEILING SEEMED TO HAVE RAISED ITSELF SO MUCH HIGHER THAN BEFORE AND MUCH OF THE FURNITURE HAD CHANGED IN APPEARANCE AND SHIFTED MARVELLOUSLY IT WAS ALL SO CONFUSED AND CONFUSING
8108-274318-0006 INTO THE DIMENSIONS OF QUITE ANOTHER CHAMBER THAT CAME TO HIM WITH ITS HOST OF CATS AND ITS STRANGE DISTANCES IN A SORT OF VISION BUT THESE CHANGES CAME ABOUT A LITTLE LATER AND AT A TIME WHEN HIS ATTENTION WAS SO CONCENTRATED
8108-274318-0007 UPON THE PROCEEDINGS OF SMOKE AND THE COLLIE THAT HE ONLY OBSERVED THEM AS IT WERE SUBCONSCIOUSLY AND THE EXCITEMENT THE FLICKERING CANDLELIGHT THE DISTRESS HE FELT FOR THE COLLIE
8108-274318-0008 WERE THE POOREST POSSIBLE ALLIES TO CAREFUL OBSERVATION AT FIRST HE WAS ONLY AWARE THAT THE DOG WAS REPEATING HIS SHORT DANGEROUS BARK FROM TIME TO TIME SNAPPING VICIOUSLY AT THE EMPTY AIR A FOOT OR SO FROM THE GROUND ONCE INDEED
8108-274318-0009 HE SPRANG UPWARDS AND FORWARDS WORKING FURIOUSLY WITH TEETH AND PAWS AND WITH A NOISE LIKE WOLVES FIGHTING BUT ONLY TO DASH BACK THE NEXT MINUTE AGAINST THE WALL BEHIND HIM THEN AFTER LYING STILL FOR A BIT HE ROSE TO A CROUCHING POSITION
8108-274318-0010 AS THOUGH TO SPRING AGAIN SNARLING HORRIBLY AND MAKING SHORT HALF CIRCLES WITH LOWERED HEAD AND SMOKE ALL THE WHILE MEOWED PITEOUSLY BY THE WINDOW AS THOUGH TRYING TO DRAW THE ATTACK UPON HIMSELF THEN IT WAS THAT THE RUSH OF THE WHOLE DREADFUL BUSINESS
8108-274318-0011 SEEMED TO TURN ASIDE FROM THE DOG AND DIRECT ITSELF UPON HIS OWN PERSON THE COLLIE HAD MADE ANOTHER SPRING AND FALLEN BACK WITH A CRASH INTO THE CORNER WHERE HE MADE NOISE ENOUGH IN HIS SAVAGE RAGE TO WAKEN THE DEAD BEFORE HE FELL TO WHINING
8108-274318-0012 AND DIRECTLY AFTERWARDS THE DOCTOR'S OWN DISTRESS BECAME INTOLERABLY ACUTE HE HAD MADE A HALF MOVEMENT FORWARD TO COME TO THE RESCUE WHEN A VEIL THAT WAS DENSER THAN MERE FOG SEEMED TO DROP DOWN OVER THE SCENE DRAPING ROOM
8108-274318-0013 WALLS ANIMALS AND FIRE IN A MIST OF DARKNESS AND FOLDING ALSO ABOUT HIS OWN MIND OTHER FORMS MOVED SILENTLY ACROSS THE FIELD OF VISION FORMS THAT HE RECOGNISED FROM PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS AND WELCOMED NOT
8108-274318-0014 UNHOLY THOUGHTS BEGAN TO CROWD INTO HIS BRAIN SINISTER SUGGESTIONS OF EVIL PRESENTED THEMSELVES SEDUCTIVELY ICE SEEMED TO SETTLE ABOUT HIS HEART AND HIS MIND TREMBLED HE BEGAN TO LOSE MEMORY
8108-274318-0015 MEMORY OF HIS IDENTITY OF WHERE HE WAS OF WHAT HE OUGHT TO DO THE VERY FOUNDATIONS OF HIS STRENGTH WERE SHAKEN
8108-274318-0016 AND IT WAS THEN THAT THE ROOM FILLED WITH THIS HORDE OF CATS ALL DARK AS THE NIGHT ALL SILENT ALL WITH LAMPING EYES OF GREEN FIRE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE PLACE ALTERED AND SHIFTED HE WAS IN A MUCH LARGER SPACE
8108-274318-0017 THE WHINING OF THE DOG SOUNDED FAR AWAY AND ALL ABOUT HIM THE CATS FLEW BUSILY TO AND FRO SILENTLY PLAYING THEIR TEARING RUSHING GAME OF EVIL WEAVING THE PATTERN OF THEIR DARK PURPOSE UPON THE FLOOR
8108-274318-0018 HE STROVE HARD TO COLLECT HIMSELF AND REMEMBER THE WORDS OF POWER HE HAD MADE USE OF BEFORE IN SIMILAR DREAD POSITIONS WHERE HIS DANGEROUS PRACTICE HAD SOMETIMES LED BUT HE COULD RECALL NOTHING CONSECUTIVELY
8108-274318-0019 A MIST LAY OVER HIS MIND AND MEMORY HE FELT DAZED AND HIS FORCES SCATTERED THE DEEPS WITHIN WERE TOO TROUBLED FOR HEALING POWER TO COME OUT OF THEM IT WAS GLAMOUR OF COURSE HE REALISED AFTERWARDS
8108-274318-0020 THE STRONG GLAMOUR THROWN UPON HIS IMAGINATION BY SOME POWERFUL PERSONALITY BEHIND THE VEIL BUT AT THE TIME HE WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY AWARE OF THIS AND AS WITH ALL TRUE GLAMOUR WAS UNABLE TO GRASP
8108-274318-0021 BEHIND HIM LIKE WIND BOOMING AND TEARING ITS WAY DOWN THE WINDOWS RATTLED THE CANDLE FLICKERED AND WENT OUT THE GLACIAL ATMOSPHERE CLOSED ROUND HIM WITH THE COLD OF DEATH AND A GREAT RUSHING SOUND SWEPT BY OVERHEAD
8108-274318-0022 SOMETHING FROM THE REGION OF UTTER COLD WAS UPON HIM AND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY THROUGH THE CONFUSED MISTS ABOUT HIM THERE SLOWLY ROSE UP THE PERSONALITY THAT HAD BEEN ALL THE TIME DIRECTING THE BATTLE SOME FORCE ENTERED HIS BEING
8108-274318-0023 THAT SHOOK HIM AS THE TEMPEST SHAKES A LEAF AND CLOSE AGAINST HIS EYES CLEAN LEVEL WITH HIS FACE HE FOUND HIMSELF STARING INTO THE WRECK OF A VAST DARK COUNTENANCE A COUNTENANCE THAT WAS TERRIBLE EVEN IN ITS RUIN
8108-274318-0024 AND THE MARK OF SPIRITUAL EVIL WAS BRANDED EVERYWHERE UPON ITS BROKEN FEATURES EYES FACE AND HAIR ROSE LEVEL WITH HIS OWN
8108-274318-0025 HE NEVER COULD PROPERLY MEASURE OR DETERMINE THESE TWO A MAN AND A WOMAN LOOKED STRAIGHT INTO EACH OTHER'S VISAGES AND DOWN INTO EACH OTHER'S HEARTS AND JOHN SILENCE THE SOUL WITH THE GOOD UNSELFISH MOTIVE
8108-274318-0026 HELD HIS OWN AGAINST THE DARK DISCARNATE WOMAN WHOSE MOTIVE WAS PURE EVIL AND WHOSE SOUL WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE DARK POWERS IT WAS THE CLIMAX THAT TOUCHED THE DEPTH OF POWER WITHIN HIM AND BEGAN TO RESTORE HIM SLOWLY TO HIS OWN
8108-274318-0027 HE WAS CONSCIOUS OF COURSE OF EFFORT AND YET IT SEEMED NO SUPERHUMAN ONE FOR HE HAD RECOGNISED THE CHARACTER OF HIS OPPONENT'S POWER AND HE CALLED UPON THE GOOD WITHIN HIM TO MEET AND OVERCOME IT
8108-274318-0028 THE INNER FORCES STIRRED AND TREMBLED IN RESPONSE TO HIS CALL THEY DID NOT AT FIRST COME READILY AS WAS THEIR HABIT FOR UNDER THE SPELL OF GLAMOUR THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN DIABOLICALLY LULLED INTO INACTIVITY BUT COME THEY EVENTUALLY DID
8108-274318-0029 AND POWER AND CONFIDENCE CAME WITH THEM HE BEGAN TO BREATHE DEEPLY AND REGULARLY AND AT THE SAME TIME TO ABSORB INTO HIMSELF THE FORCES OPPOSED TO HIM AND TO TURN THEM TO HIS OWN ACCOUNT
8108-274318-0030 BY CEASING TO RESIST AND ALLOWING THE DEADLY STREAM TO POUR INTO HIM UNOPPOSED HE USED THE VERY POWER SUPPLIED BY HIS ADVERSARY AND THUS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED HIS OWN FOR THIS SPIRITUAL ALCHEMY HE HAD LEARNED HE UNDERSTOOD THAT FORCE
8108-274318-0031 ULTIMATELY IS EVERYWHERE ONE AND THE SAME IT IS THE MOTIVE BEHIND THAT MAKES IT GOOD OR EVIL AND HIS MOTIVE WAS ENTIRELY UNSELFISH HE KNEW PROVIDED HE WAS NOT FIRST ROBBED OF SELF CONTROL
8108-274318-0032 HOW VICARIOUSLY TO ABSORB THESE EVIL RADIATIONS INTO HIMSELF AND CHANGE THEM MAGICALLY INTO HIS OWN GOOD PURPOSES AND SINCE HIS MOTIVE WAS PURE AND HIS SOUL FEARLESS THEY COULD NOT WORK HIM HARM
8108-274318-0033 THUS HE STOOD IN THE MAIN STREAM OF EVIL UNWITTINGLY ATTRACTED BY PENDER DEFLECTING ITS COURSE UPON HIMSELF AND AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE PURIFYING FILTER OF HIS OWN UNSELFISHNESS THESE ENERGIES COULD ONLY ADD TO HIS STORE OF EXPERIENCE OF KNOWLEDGE
8108-274318-0034 AND THEREFORE OF POWER AND AS HIS SELF CONTROL RETURNED TO HIM HE GRADUALLY ACCOMPLISHED THIS PURPOSE EVEN THOUGH TREMBLING WHILE HE DID SO YET THE STRUGGLE WAS SEVERE AND IN SPITE OF THE FREEZING CHILL OF THE AIR
8108-274318-0035 THE PERSPIRATION POURED DOWN HIS FACE THEN BY SLOW DEGREES THE DARK AND DREADFUL COUNTENANCE FADED THE GLAMOUR PASSED FROM HIS SOUL THE NORMAL PROPORTIONS RETURNED TO WALLS AND CEILING THE FORMS MELTED BACK INTO THE FOG
8108-274318-0036 AND THE WHIRL OF RUSHING SHADOW CATS DISAPPEARED WHENCE THEY CAME AND WITH THE RETURN OF THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF HIS OWN IDENTITY JOHN SILENCE WAS RESTORED TO THE FULL CONTROL OF HIS OWN WILL POWER IN A DEEP MODULATED VOICE
8108-274318-0037 HE MADE CERTAIN SIGILS GESTURES AND MOVEMENTS AT THE SAME TIME FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE CONTINUED TO UTTER THESE WORDS UNTIL AT LENGTH THE GROWING VOLUME DOMINATED THE WHOLE ROOM AND MASTERED THE MANIFESTATION OF ALL THAT OPPOSED IT
8108-274318-0038 FOR JUST AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE SPIRITUAL ALCHEMY THAT CAN TRANSMUTE EVIL FORCES BY RAISING THEM INTO HIGHER CHANNELS SO HE KNEW FROM LONG STUDY THE OCCULT USE OF SOUND AND ITS DIRECT EFFECT UPON THE PLASTIC REGION
8108-274318-0039 WHEREIN THE POWERS OF SPIRITUAL EVIL WORK THEIR FELL PURPOSES HARMONY WAS RESTORED FIRST OF ALL TO HIS OWN SOUL AND THENCE TO THE ROOM AND ALL ITS OCCUPANTS AND AFTER HIMSELF THE FIRST TO RECOGNISE IT WAS THE OLD DOG LYING IN HIS CORNER
8108-274318-0040 FLAME BEGAN SUDDENLY UTTERING SOUNDS OF PLEASURE THAT SOMETHING BETWEEN A GROWL AND A GRUNT THAT DOGS MAKE UPON BEING RESTORED TO THEIR MASTER'S CONFIDENCE DOCTOR SILENCE HEARD THE THUMPING OF THE COLLIE'S TAIL AGAINST THE FLOOR AND THE GRUNT
8108-274318-0041 AND THE THUMPING TOUCHED THE DEPTH OF AFFECTION IN THE MAN'S HEART AND GAVE HIM SOME INKLING OF WHAT AGONIES THE DUMB CREATURE HAD SUFFERED NEXT FROM THE SHADOWS BY THE WINDOW A SOMEWHAT SHRILL PURRING ANNOUNCED THE RESTORATION OF THE CAT TO ITS NORMAL STATE
8108-274318-0042 SMOKE WAS ADVANCING ACROSS THE CARPET HE SEEMED VERY PLEASED WITH HIMSELF AND SMILED WITH AN EXPRESSION OF SUPREME INNOCENCE HE WAS NO SHADOW CAT BUT REAL AND FULL OF HIS USUAL AND PERFECT SELF POSSESSION HE MARCHED ALONG PICKING HIS WAY DELICATELY
8108-274318-0043 CLEARLY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE MISCHIEF TO WHICH HE HAD UNWITTINGLY LENT HIMSELF OWING TO HIS SUBTLE AND ELECTRIC CONSTITUTION STILL UTTERING HIS SHARP HIGH PURRINGS HE MARCHED UP TO HIS MASTER AND RUBBED VIGOROUSLY AGAINST HIS LEGS
8108-274318-0044 AND PAWED HIS KNEES AND STARED BESEECHINGLY UP INTO HIS FACE HE TURNED HIS HEAD TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE THE COLLIE STILL LAY THUMPING HIS TAIL FEEBLY AND PATHETICALLY JOHN SILENCE UNDERSTOOD HE BENT DOWN AND STROKED THE CREATURE'S LIVING FUR
8108-274318-0045 NOTING THE LINE OF BRIGHT BLUE SPARKS THAT FOLLOWED THE MOTION OF HIS HAND DOWN ITS BACK AND THEN THEY ADVANCED TOGETHER TOWARDS THE CORNER WHERE THE DOG WAS SMOKE WENT FIRST AND PUT HIS NOSE GENTLY AGAINST HIS FRIEND'S MUZZLE PURRING WHILE HE RUBBED
8108-274318-0046 AND UTTERING LITTLE SOFT SOUNDS OF AFFECTION IN HIS THROAT THE DOCTOR LIT THE CANDLE AND BROUGHT IT OVER HE SAW THE COLLIE LYING ON ITS SIDE AGAINST THE WALL IT WAS UTTERLY EXHAUSTED AND FOAM STILL HUNG ABOUT ITS JAWS ITS TAIL AND EYES RESPONDED TO THE SOUND OF ITS NAME
8108-274318-0047 BUT IT WAS EVIDENTLY VERY WEAK AND OVERCOME SMOKE CONTINUED TO RUB AGAINST ITS CHEEK AND NOSE AND EYES SOMETIMES EVEN STANDING ON ITS BODY AND KNEADING INTO THE THICK YELLOW HAIR FLAME REPLIED FROM TIME TO TIME BY LITTLE LICKS OF THE TONGUE
8108-274318-0048 MOST OF THEM CURIOUSLY MISDIRECTED BUT DOCTOR SILENCE FELT INTUITIVELY THAT SOMETHING DISASTROUS HAD HAPPENED AND HIS HEART WAS WRUNG HE STROKED THE DEAR BODY FEELING IT OVER FOR BRUISES OR BROKEN BONES BUT FINDING NONE
8108-280354-0000 JASON HAD PERSUADED ORPHEUS TO ACCOMPANY THE ARGONAUTS WHEN THEY WENT TO FETCH BACK THE GOLDEN FLEECE FOR HE KNEW THAT THE PERILS OF THE WAY WOULD BE LIGHTENED BY SONG TO THE SOUND OF HIS LYRE THE ARGO HAD FLOATED DOWN TO THE SEA
8108-280354-0001 AND HE PLAYED SO SWEETLY WHEN THEY PASSED THE ROCKS OF THE SIRENS THAT THE DREADFUL MONSTERS SANG THEIR MOST ALLURING STRAINS IN VAIN
8108-280354-0002 WHOM HE LOVED DEARLY AND WHO RETURNED HIS LOVE BUT AT THEIR MARRIAGE THE OMENS WERE NOT FAVORABLE HYMEN THE MARRIAGE GOD CAME TO IT WITH A GLOOMY COUNTENANCE AND THE WEDDING TORCHES SMOKED
8108-280354-0003 AND WOULD NOT GIVE FORTH A CHEERFUL FLAME
8108-280354-0004 WAS TO BE BUT SHORT LIVED FOR AS THE NEW MADE BRIDE WANDERED THROUGH THE WOODS WITH THE OTHER NYMPHS A POISONOUS SERPENT STUNG HER HEEL AND NO REMEDY AVAILED TO SAVE HER ORPHEUS WAS THROWN
8108-280354-0005 INTO MOST PASSIONATE GRIEF AT HIS WIFE'S DEATH HE COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT HE HAD LOST HER FOR EVER BUT PRAYED DAY AND NIGHT WITHOUT CEASING TO THE GODS ABOVE TO RESTORE HER TO HIM WHEN THEY WOULD NOT LISTEN
8108-280354-0006 HE RESOLVED TO MAKE ONE LAST EFFORT TO WIN HER BACK HE WOULD GO DOWN TO THE LOWER WORLD AND SEEK HER AMONG THE DEAD AND TRY WHETHER ANY PRAYER OR PERSUASION COULD MOVE PLUTO TO RESTORE HIS BELOVED NEAR TAENARUM
8108-280354-0007 IN LACONIA WAS A CAVE AMONG DARK AND GLOOMY ROCKS THROUGH WHICH LED ONE OF THE ENTRANCES TO THE LOWER WORLD THIS WAS THE ROAD BY WHICH HERCULES DESCENDED WHEN HE WENT TO CARRY OFF CERBERUS
8108-280354-0008 THE THREE HEADED DOG THAT GUARDS THE THRESHOLD OF PLUTO UNDAUNTED BY THE TERRORS OF THE PLACE ORPHEUS PASSED THROUGH THIS GATE AND DOWN A DARK AND DISMAL ROAD TO THE KINGDOM OF THE DEAD
8108-280354-0009 HERE HE CAME IN SAFETY THROUGH THE CROWD OF GHOSTS AND PHANTOMS AND STOOD AT LAST BEFORE THE THRONE OF PLUTO AND PROSERPINA THEN HE TOUCHED THE CHORDS OF HIS LYRE AND CHANTED THESE WORDS
8108-280354-0010 GREAT LORDS OF THE WORLD BELOW THE EARTH TO WHICH ALL WE MORTALS MUST ONE DAY COME GRANT ME TO TELL A SIMPLE TALE
8108-280354-0011 THE LIFELESS GHOSTS CAME FLOCKING AND AS THEY HEARD THEY WEPT TANTALUS FORGOT HIS HUNGER AND THIRST
8108-280354-0012 SAT ON HIS STONE TO LISTEN NEVER YET HAD SUCH SWEET STRAINS BEEN HEARD IN THE WORLD OF GLOOM THEN FOR THE FIRST TIME TEARS MOISTENED THE CHEEKS OF THE FURIES AND EVEN THE KING AND QUEEN OF THE DEAD WERE MOVED TO PITY
8108-280354-0013 AND SHE CAME YET HALTING FROM HER RECENT WOUND TAKE HER SAYS PLUTO AND LEAD HER BACK TO THE LIGHT
8108-280354-0014 NOR MUST YOU ONCE TURN ROUND TO LOOK UPON HER
8108-280354-0015 ELSE THE BOON WE GRANT YOU WILL BE BUT VAIN A STEEP PATH LED UPWARD FROM THE REALM OF DARKNESS AND THE WAY WAS HARD TO FIND THROUGH THE GLOOM IN SILENCE ORPHEUS LED ON TILL THE GOAL WAS CLOSE AT HAND
8108-280354-0016 AND THE WELCOMING LIGHT OF THE UPPER AIR BEGAN TO PENETRATE THE DARKNESS THEN A SUDDEN FEAR STRUCK HIS HEART
8108-280354-0017 HE TURNED TO GAZE ON HIS BELOVED DIMLY HE SAW HER BUT FOR THE LAST TIME FOR A POWER SHE COULD NOT RESIST DREW HER BACK ORPHEUS STRETCHED OUT HIS ARMS AND TRIED TO SEIZE HER BUT HE ONLY CLASPED THE EMPTY AIR
8108-280354-0018 HE SAT ON THE FURTHER BANK WITHOUT FOOD OR DRINK
8108-280354-0019 THEN AT LAST HE KNEW THAT THE GODS BELOW WERE PITILESS AND FULL OF SORROW HE RETURNED TO THE UPPER EARTH FOR THREE YEARS
8108-280354-0020 FINDING HIS ONLY CONSOLATION IN THE MUSIC OF HIS LYRE FOR HE SHUNNED ALL MEN AND WOMEN
8108-280354-0021 ONE DAY HE SAT DOWN TO REST ON A GRASSY HILL IN THE SUNSHINE AND PLAYED AND SANG TO BEGUILE HIS SORROW AS HE PLAYED THE COOLNESS OF SHADY BRANCHES SEEMED ALL ABOUT HIM AND LOOKING UP HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE MIDST OF A WOOD
8108-280354-0022 OAK POPLAR LIME BEECH LAUREL ASH PINE PLANE AND MAPLE AND MANY ANOTHER TREE HAD GATHERED TOGETHER HERE DRAWN FROM THEIR DISTANT FOREST HOMES BY THE SOUNDS OF ORPHEUS'S LYRE
8108-280354-0023 YES AND THE BEASTS AND THE BIRDS OF THE FIELD CAME TOO AND ORPHEUS SAT IN THEIR MIDST AND SANG AND PLAYED THE TUNES OF SORROW SUDDENLY A GREAT NOISE WAS HEARD OF LAUGHTER AND SHOUTING AND MERRY MAKING
8108-280354-0024 FOR THIS WAS ONE OF THE FEASTS OF BACCHUS AND THE WOMEN WERE CELEBRATING HIS RITES WANDERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH DANCE AND REVEL WHEN THEY SAW ORPHEUS THEY SET UP A SHOUT OF DERISION SEE THEY CRIED
8108-280354-0025 THE WRETCHED SINGER WHO MOCKS AT WOMEN AND WILL HAVE NO BRIDE BUT THE DEAD COME LET US KILL HIM AND SHOW THAT NO MAN SHALL DESPISE US UNPUNISHED WITH THESE WORDS THEY BEGAN TO THROW WANDS AND STONES AT HIM
8108-280354-0026 AND FELL HARMLESSLY TO THE GROUND THEN THE WOMEN RAISED A WILD SHOUT AND MADE SUCH A CLAMOR WITH TRUMPETS AND CYMBALS THAT THE SOFT TONES OF THE HARP WERE DROWNED BY THE NOISE NOW AT LAST THE SHOTS TOOK EFFECT
8108-280354-0027 AND IN THEIR FURY THE WOMEN FELL UPON HIM DEALING BLOW ON BLOW ORPHEUS FELL LIFELESS TO THE GROUND BUT HE WAS NOT TO DIE UNWEPT THE LITTLE BIRDS OF THE FOREST MOURNED FOR HIM EVEN THE STONY ROCKS WEPT
8108-280354-0028 THE TREES SHED THEIR LEAVES WITH GRIEF AND THE DRYADS AND NAIADS TORE THEIR HAIR AND PUT ON THE GARB OF SORROW ONLY THE PITILESS REVELERS KNEW NO REMORSE THEY SEIZED THE SINGER'S HEAD
8108-280354-0029 AND THREW IT WITH HIS LYRE INTO THE RIVER HEBRUS THERE IT FLOATED DOWN STREAM AND STRANGE TO TELL THE CHORDS GAVE FORTH A LAMENT AND THE LIFELESS TONGUE UTTERED WORDS
8108-280354-0030 IT CRIED TILL HEAD AND LYRE WERE CARRIED DOWN TO THE SEA AND ON TO LESBOS THE ISLE OF SWEET SONG WHERE IN AFTER YEARS
8108-280354-0031 AND SAPPHO TUNED AFRESH THE LYRE OF ORPHEUS
8108-280359-0000 FOR THE FUTURE HE MUST BEND ALL HIS CUNNING AND VIGILANCE TO THE TASK OF HIDING HIMSELF FROM THE GAZE OF THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO INJURED AND ESCAPING THE JUST PUNISHMENT HE HAD BROUGHT UPON HIMSELF
8108-280359-0001 THE WORLD IS LARGE AND I AM VERY CLEVER SAID LOKI TO HIMSELF AS HE TURNED HIS BACK UPON ASGARD AND WANDERED OUT INTO MANHEIM
8108-280359-0002 AND NO MEASURE FOR THE DEEP WATERS NEITHER IS THERE ANY POSSIBILITY OF COUNTING THE VARIOUS FORMS UNDER WHICH I SHALL DISGUISE MYSELF ODIN WILL NEVER BE ABLE TO FIND ME
8108-280359-0003 I HAVE NO CAUSE TO FEAR BUT THOUGH LOKI REPEATED THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN TO HIMSELF HE WAS AFRAID HE WANDERED FAR INTO THE THICK WOODS AND COVERED HIMSELF WITH THE DEEP WATERS
8108-280359-0004 HE CLIMBED TO THE TOPS OF MISTY HILLS AND CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF HOLLOW CAVES BUT ABOVE THE WOOD AND THROUGH THE WATER AND DOWN INTO THE DARKNESS A SINGLE RAY OF CALM CLEAR LIGHT SEEMED ALWAYS TO FOLLOW HIM
8108-280359-0005 AND HE KNEW THAT IT CAME FROM THE EYE OF ODIN WHO WAS WATCHING HIM FROM AIR THRONE THEN HE TRIED TO ESCAPE THE WATCHFUL EYE BY DISGUISING HIMSELF UNDER VARIOUS SHAPES SOMETIMES HE WAS AN EAGLE ON A LONELY MOUNTAIN CRAG
8108-280359-0006 SOMETIMES HE HID HIMSELF AS ONE AMONG A TROOP OF TIMID REINDEER SOMETIMES HE LAY IN THE NEST OF A WOOD PIGEON SOMETIMES HE SWAM A BRIGHT SPOTTED FISH IN THE SEA BUT WHEREVER HE WAS AMONG LIVING CREATURES
8108-280359-0007 OR ALONE WITH DEAD NATURE EVERYTHING SEEMED TO KNOW HIM AND TO FIND A VOICE IN WHICH TO SAY TO HIM
8108-280359-0008 AIR EARTH OR WATER THERE WAS NO REST FOR HIM ANYWHERE TIRED AT LAST OF SEEKING WHAT HE COULD NOWHERE FIND LOKI BUILT HIMSELF A HOUSE NEAR A NARROW GLITTERING RIVER WHICH LOWER DOWN FLASHED FROM A HIGH ROCK INTO THE SEA BELOW
8108-280359-0009 HE TOOK CARE THAT HIS HOUSE SHOULD HAVE FOUR DOORS IN IT THAT HE MIGHT LOOK OUT ON EVERY SIDE AND CATCH THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE GODS WHEN THEY CAME AS HE KNEW THEY WOULD COME TO TAKE HIM AWAY HERE HIS WIFE SIGUNA AND HIS TWO SONS
8108-280359-0010 ALI AND NARI CAME TO LIVE WITH HIM SIGUNA WAS A KIND WOMAN FAR TOO GOOD AND KIND FOR LOKI SHE FELT SORRY FOR HIM NOW THAT SHE SAW HE WAS IN GREAT FEAR AND THAT EVERY LIVING THING HAD TURNED AGAINST HIM
8108-280359-0011 AND SHE WOULD HAVE HIDDEN HIM FROM THE JUST ANGER OF THE GODS IF SHE COULD BUT THE TWO SONS CARED LITTLE ABOUT THEIR FATHER'S DREAD AND DANGER THEY SPENT ALL THEIR TIME IN QUARRELING WITH EACH OTHER AND THEIR LOUD ANGRY VOICES SOUNDING ABOVE THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0012 WOULD SPEEDILY HAVE BETRAYED THE HIDING PLACE EVEN IF ODIN'S PIERCING EYE HAD NOT ALREADY FOUND IT OUT AT LAST ONE DAY WHEN HE WAS SITTING IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS HOUSE LOOKING ALTERNATELY OUT OF ALL THE FOUR DOORS AND AMUSING HIMSELF AS WELL AS HE COULD
8108-280359-0013 BY MAKING A FISHING NET HE SPIED IN THE DISTANCE THE WHOLE COMPANY OF THE GODS APPROACHING HIS HOUSE THE SIGHT OF THEM COMING ALL TOGETHER BEAUTIFUL AND NOBLE AND FREE PIERCED LOKI WITH A PANG THAT WAS WORSE THAN DEATH
8108-280359-0014 HE ROSE WITHOUT DARING TO LOOK AGAIN THREW HIS NET ON A FIRE THAT BURNED ON THE FLOOR AND RUSHING TO THE SIDE OF THE LITTLE RIVER HE TURNED HIMSELF INTO A SALMON SWAM DOWN TO THE DEEPEST STILLEST POOL AT THE BOTTOM
8108-280359-0015 AND HID HIMSELF BETWEEN TWO STONES THE GODS ENTERED THE HOUSE AND LOOKED ALL ROUND IN VAIN FOR LOKI
8108-280359-0016 FAMOUS FOR HIS KEEN SIGHT SPIED OUT THE REMAINS OF THE FISHING NET IN THE FIRE THEN ODIN KNEW AT ONCE THAT THERE WAS A RIVER NEAR AND THAT IT WAS THERE WHERE LOKI HAD HIDDEN HIMSELF HE ORDERED HIS SONS TO MAKE A NEW NET AND TO CAST IT INTO THE WATER
8108-280359-0017 AND DRAG OUT WHATEVER LIVING THING THEY COULD FIND THERE IT WAS DONE AS HE DESIRED THOR HELD ONE END OF THE NET AND ALL THE REST OF THE GODS DREW THE OTHER THROUGH THE WATER WHEN THEY PULLED IT UP THE FIRST TIME HOWEVER IT WAS EMPTY AND THEY WOULD HAVE GONE AWAY DISAPPOINTED
8108-280359-0018 SAW THAT SOMETHING LIVING HAD CERTAINLY TOUCHED THEM THEY THEN ADDED A WEIGHT TO THE NET AND THREW IT WITH SUCH FORCE THAT IT REACHED THE BOTTOM OF THE RIVER AND DRAGGED UP THE STONES IN THE POOL LOKI NOW SAW THE DANGER HE WAS IN OF BEING CAUGHT IN THE NET AND
8108-280359-0019 BUT NOT SO QUICKLY BUT THAT THE GODS SAW HIM KNEW HIM THROUGH HIS DISGUISE AND RESOLVED THAT HE SHOULD NO LONGER ESCAPE THEY THEMSELVES DIVIDED INTO TWO BANDS THOR WADED DOWN THE RIVER TO THE WATERFALL
8108-280359-0020 THE OTHER GODS STOOD IN A GROUP BELOW LOKI SWAM BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS BETWEEN THEM FIRST HE THOUGHT HE WOULD DART OUT INTO THE SEA AND THEN THAT HE WOULD SPRING OVER THE NET BACK AGAIN INTO THE RIVER THIS LAST SEEMED THE EASIEST WAY OF ESCAPE
8108-280359-0021 AND WITH THE GREATEST SPEED HE ATTEMPTED IT THOR HOWEVER WAS WATCHING FOR HIM AND AS SOON AS LOKI LEAPED OUT OF THE WATER HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND AND CAUGHT HIM WHILE HE WAS YET TURNING IN THE AIR
8108-280359-0022 LOKI WRIGGLED HIS SLIPPERY SLIMY LENGTH THROUGH THOR'S FINGERS BUT THE THUNDERER GRASPED HIM TIGHTLY BY THE TAIL AND HOLDING HIM IN THIS MANNER IN THIS HAND WADED TO THE SHORE THERE FATHER ODIN AND THE OTHER GODS MET HIM AND
8108-280359-0023 AT ODIN'S FIRST SEARCHING LOOK LOKI WAS OBLIGED TO DROP HIS DISGUISE AND COWERING AND FRIGHTENED TO ASSUME HIS PROPER SHAPE BEFORE THE ASSEMBLED LORDS ONE BY ONE THEY TURNED THEIR FACES FROM HIM FOR IN LOOKING AT HIM
8108-280359-0024 THEY SEEMED TO SEE OVER AGAIN THE DEATH OF BALDUR THE BELOVED YOU WERE TOLD THAT THERE WERE HIGH ROCKS LOOKING OVER THE SEA NEAR LOKI'S HOUSE ONE OF THESE HIGHER THAN THE REST HAD MIDWAY FOUR PROJECTING STONES AND TO THESE THE GODS RESOLVED TO BIND LOKI
8108-280359-0025 BE ABLE TO TORMENT THE INHABITANTS OF MANHEIM OR ASGARD BY HIS EVIL DOINGS THOR PROPOSED TO RETURN TO ASGARD TO BRING A CHAIN WITH WHICH TO BIND THE PRISONER BUT ODIN ASSURED HIM THAT HE HAD NO NEED TO TAKE SUCH A JOURNEY
8108-280359-0026 LOKI HE SAID HAS ALREADY FORGED FOR HIMSELF A CHAIN STRONGER THAN ANY YOU CAN MAKE WHILE WE HAVE BEEN OCCUPIED IN CATCHING HIM HIS TWO SONS ALI AND NARI TRANSFORMED INTO WOLVES
8108-280359-0027 BY THEIR EVIL PASSIONS HAVE FOUGHT WITH AND DESTROYED EACH OTHER WITH THEIR SINEWS WE MUST MAKE A CHAIN TO BIND THEIR FATHER AND FROM THAT HE CAN NEVER ESCAPE IT WAS DONE AS ASA ODIN SAID
8108-280359-0028 A ROPE WAS MADE OF THE DEAD WOLVES SINEWS AND AS SOON AS IT TOUCHED LOKI'S BODY IT TURNED INTO BANDS OF IRON
8123-275193-0000 JEFF THE INQUISITIVE BY GENERAL RUSH C HAWKINS AMONG THE GUNBOATS DOING DUTY ON THE INLAND WATERS OF NORTH CAROLINA IN THE EARLY SPRING OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO
8123-275193-0001 WHICH COMPOSED WHAT COMMODORE GOLDSBOROUGH DESIGNATED HIS PASTEBOARD FLEET WAS THE LOUISIANA COMMANDED BY COMMANDER ALEXANDER MURRAY WHO WAS NOTED FOR HIS EFFICIENCY AND GOOD NATURE HIS TREATMENT OF HIS CREW
8123-275193-0002 MADE HIM ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR OFFICERS IN THE WHOLE FLEET HE ENTERED INTO ALL OF THEIR SPORTS AND SYMPATHIZED WITH THE DISCOMFORTS OF FORECASTLE LIFE HE WAS FOND OF ANIMAL PETS AND ALWAYS WELCOMED THE ARRIVAL OF A NEW ONE
8123-275193-0003 HE WAS A PERFECTLY BLACK PIG OF THE RACER RAZOR BACK ORDER WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE PLENTIFUL IN THE COAST SECTIONS OF THE MORE SOUTHERN OF THE SLAVE HOLDING STATES THEY WERE CALLED RACERS
8123-275193-0004 BECAUSE OF THEIR LONG LEGS SLENDER BODIES AND GREAT CAPACITY FOR RUNNING AND RAZOR BACKS ON ACCOUNT OF THE PROMINENCE OF THE SPINAL COLUMN THE ORIGIN OF THIS PARTICULAR SPECIES OF THE PORCINE TRIBE IS UNKNOWN BUT THERE IS A TRADITION TO THE EFFECT
8123-275193-0005 POSSIBLY WHILE ESCAPING FROM THE PROSPECTIVE MESS KETTLE OF A CONFEDERATE PICKET IN THOSE DAYS CONFEDERATE PICKETS WERE NOT VERY PARTICULAR AS TO THE QUALITY OR KIND OF FOOD AND I HAVE A SUSPICION THAT EVEN A RAZOR BACK WOULD HAVE BEEN A WELCOME ADDITION TO THEIR MEAL
8123-275193-0006 THE DOCTOR WAS CONSULTED AND AFTER A CAREFUL DIAGNOSIS DECIDED THERE WAS NO ORGANIC DISEASE WANT OF PARENTAL CARE WANT OF NOURISHMENT AND EXPOSURE WERE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR JEFF'S UNFAVORABLE CONDITION
8123-275193-0007 IT WAS DECIDED TO PUT HIM ON A LIGHT DIET OF MILK WHICH PROVED AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS FOR WITHIN FORTY EIGHT HOURS AFTER HIS FIRST MEAL THE PATIENT BECAME AS LIVELY AS POSSIBLE AS DAYS AND WEEKS WENT ON
8123-275193-0008 HE ATTACHED HIMSELF TO EACH INDIVIDUAL OF THE SHIP HE HAD NO FAVORITES BUT WAS HAIL FELLOW WELL MET WITH ALL HE DEVELOPED ALL THE PLAYFUL QUALITIES OF A PUPPY AND REASONED OUT A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS IN HIS OWN WAY
8123-275193-0009 HIS PARTICULAR ADMIRERS DECLARED THAT HE LEARNED THE MEANING OF THE DIFFERENT WHISTLES OF THE BOATSWAIN THAT HE KNEW WHEN THE MEAL PENNANT WAS HOISTED TO THE PEAK COULD TELL WHEN THE CREW WAS BEAT TO QUARTERS FOR DRILL
8123-275193-0010 IN THIS ACT OF COURTESY HE IS ALWAYS ACCOMPANIED BY THE OFFICER OF THE DECK AND OFTEN BY OTHERS THAT MAY HAPPEN TO BE AT HAND AFTER THE ADVENT OF JEFF WHENEVER I WENT ON BOARD THE LOUISIANA HE WAS ALWAYS AT THE GANGWAY
8123-275193-0011 AND SEEMINGLY WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN THE EVENT IT MAY BE SAID OF HIM GENERALLY THAT HE WAS OVERFLOWING WITH SPIRITS AND TOOK AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN ALL THE DAILY ROUTINE WORK OF HIS SHIP
8123-275193-0012 IN THE GRADUAL DEVELOPMENT OF JEFF'S CHARACTER IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT HE HAD NONE OF THE USUAL WELL KNOWN TRAITS OF THE PIG HE WAS MORE LIKE A PETTED AND PAMPERED DOG
8123-275193-0013 WAS PLAYFUL GOOD NATURED AND EXPRESSED PLEASURE PAIN ANGER AND DESIRE WITH VARIOUS SQUEALS AND GRUNTS DELIVERED WITH A VARIETY OF INTONATIONS THAT WERE VERY EASILY INTERPRETED
8123-275193-0014 HE WAS NEVER SO HAPPY AS WHEN IN THE LAP OF ONE OF THE SAILORS HAVING HIS BACK STROKED HIS PLEASURE UPON THOSE OCCASIONS WAS EVINCED BY THE EMISSION OF FREQUENT GOOD NATURED GRUNTS AND LOOKING UP INTO THE FACE OF THE FRIENDLY STROKER
8123-275193-0015 WHEN ON SHORE HE FOLLOWED HIS FAVORITES LIKE A DOG AND WAS NEVER KNOWN TO ROOT EXCEPT IN SPEECH AND APPEARANCE HE WAS THE COUNTERPART OF A HAPPY GOOD NATURED AND WELL CARED FOR HOUSEHOLD DOG
8123-275193-0016 POSSIBLY HOWEVER RATHER MORE INTELLIGENT THAN THE AVERAGE CANINE PET THE FOURTH OF JULY EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO WAS A GALA DAY AT ROANOKE ISLAND
8123-275193-0017 WAS MADE MORE GLORIOUS BY THE EXCHANGE OF CAMP HOSPITALITIES AND AN INDULGENCE IN SUCH SIMPLE HILARITY AS THE OCCASION SEEMED TO REQUIRE BUT JEFF WAS NOT FORGOTTEN EARLY IN THE MORNING HE WAS BATHED AND SCRUBBED
8123-275193-0018 MORE THAN TO HIS HEART'S CONTENT AND THEN PATRIOTICALLY DECORATED IN HIS RIGHT EAR WAS A RED RIBBON IN HIS LEFT A WHITE ONE AROUND HIS NECK ANOTHER OF BLUE
8123-275193-0019 THUS ADORNED HE WAS BROUGHT ON SHORE TO PAY ME A VISIT AND AS HE CAME THROUGH MY DOOR HE APPEARED TO BE FILLED WITH THE PRIDE OF PATRIOTISM AND A REALIZATION OF THE GREATNESS OF THE OCCASION
8123-275193-0020 HIS REWARD FOR THIS UNUSUAL DEMONSTRATION WAS INSTANTANEOUS AND CONSISTED OF SOME APPLES AND A TOOTHSOME DESSERT OF SUGAR AFTERWARD HE MADE THE ROUND OF THE CAMPS WITH A SPECIAL ESCORT OF WARRANT OFFICERS AND DEVOTED JACK TARS
8123-275193-0021 HE WAS SEEN AFTER HE HAD RUN A FEW YARDS TO MAKE A GREAT JUMP AND THEN REMAIN IN HIS TRACKS THE PURSUING PARTY FOUND HIM ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEMOLISHING A MOCCASIN WHICH HE HAD CRUSHED BY JUMPING AND LANDING WITH HIS FEET UPON ITS HEAD AND BACK
8123-275193-0022 HOGS OF THIS PARTICULAR KIND ARE FAMOUS SNAKE KILLERS A BIG RATTLER OR A GARTER SNAKE IS ALL THE SAME TO THEM THEY ADVANCE TO THE ATTACK WITH THE GREATEST IMPETUOSITY AND A FEAST UPON SNAKE IS THE USUAL REWARD OF EXCEPTIONAL BRAVERY
8123-275193-0023 JEFF WAS A CONFIRMED LOVER OF GOOD EATING AND IN TIME PAID THE USUAL PENALTY FOR OVER INDULGENCE OF HIS VERY PIGGISH APPETITE WHILE THE MEAL PENNANT WAS UP
8123-275193-0024 IT WAS HIS HABIT TO GO FROM ONE FORE CASTLE MESS TO ANOTHER AND TO INSIST UPON HAVING RATHER MORE THAN HIS SHARE OF THE CHOICE MORSELS FROM EACH IN A SHORT TIME HE CAME TO THE REPAIR SHOP VERY MUCH THE WORSE FOR WEAR WITH AN IMPAIRED DIGESTION
8123-275193-0025 AND A CUTICLE THAT SHOWED UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF SCURVY FOR THE FIRST HE WAS PUT UPON SHORT RATIONS FOR THE SECOND SAND BATHS ON SHORE WERE PRESCRIBED
8123-275193-0026 UNDER THIS TREATMENT POOR JEFF LOST ALL HIS BUOYANCY OF SPIRITS AND HIS HABITUAL FRISKINESS AND BECAME SAD AND DEJECTED BUT BORE HIS TROUBLES WITH PATIENCE HE TOOK TO THE SAND BATHS AT ONCE
8123-275193-0027 AND GAVE FORTH MANY DISGRUNTLED GRUNTS WHEN LIFTED OUT OF THEM THE LAST TIME I SAW JEFF IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO HE WAS BURIED UP TO HIS EARS IN THE COOL SANDS OF THE ROANOKE ISLAND SHORE WITH EYES UPTURNED AND LOOKING LIKE A VERY SAD PIG
8123-275209-0000 THE BUTTERFLY'S CHILDREN BY MISSUS ALFRED GATTY LET ME HIRE YOU AS A NURSE FOR MY POOR CHILDREN SAID A BUTTERFLY TO A QUIET CATERPILLAR WHO WAS STROLLING ALONG A CABBAGE LEAF IN HER
8123-275209-0001 WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF MY BABY BUTTERFLIES WHEN I AM GONE WILL YOU KIND MILD GREEN CATERPILLAR BUT YOU MUST MIND WHAT YOU GIVE THEM TO EAT CATERPILLAR THEY CANNOT OF COURSE LIVE ON YOUR ROUGH FOOD
8123-275209-0002 YOU MUST GIVE THEM EARLY DEW AND HONEY FROM THE FLOWERS AND YOU MUST LET THEM FLY ABOUT ONLY A LITTLE WAY AT FIRST FOR OF COURSE ONE CAN'T EXPECT THEM TO USE THEIR WINGS PROPERLY ALL AT ONCE
8123-275209-0003 DEAR ME IT IS A SAD PITY YOU CANNOT FLY YOURSELF BUT I HAVE NO TIME TO LOOK FOR ANOTHER NURSE NOW SO YOU WILL DO YOUR BEST I HOPE DEAR DEAR
8123-275209-0004 AND WITH THESE WORDS THE BUTTERFLY DROOPED HER WINGS AND DIED AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR WHO HAD NOT HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EVEN SAYING YES OR NO TO THE REQUEST
8123-275209-0005 WAS LEFT STANDING ALONE BY THE SIDE OF THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS A PRETTY NURSE SHE HAS CHOSEN INDEED POOR LADY EXCLAIMED SHE AND A PRETTY BUSINESS I HAVE IN HAND WHY HER SENSES MUST HAVE LEFT HER
8123-275209-0006 OR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE ASKED A POOR CRAWLING CREATURE LIKE ME TO BRING UP HER DAINTY LITTLE ONES MUCH THEY'LL MIND ME TRULY WHEN THEY FEEL THE GAY WINGS ON THEIR BACKS AND CAN FLY AWAY OUT OF MY SIGHT WHENEVER THEY CHOOSE
8123-275209-0007 HOWEVER THERE LAY THE EGGS ON THE CABBAGE LEAF AND THE GREEN CATERPILLAR HAD A KIND HEART SO SHE RESOLVED TO DO HER BEST BUT SHE GOT NO SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE WAS SO VERY ANXIOUS
8123-275209-0008 SHE MADE HER BACK QUITE ACHE WITH WALKING ALL NIGHT ROUND HER YOUNG CHARGES FOR FEAR ANY HARM SHOULD HAPPEN TO THEM AND IN THE MORNING SAYS SHE TO HERSELF TWO HEADS ARE BETTER THAN ONE
8123-275209-0009 WHOM SHOULD THE CATERPILLAR CONSULT THERE WAS THE SHAGGY DOG WHO SOMETIMES CAME INTO THE GARDEN BUT HE WAS SO ROUGH HE WOULD MOST LIKELY WHISK ALL THE EGGS OFF THE CABBAGE LEAF WITH ONE BRUSH OF HIS TAIL
8123-275209-0010 SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR IN GREAT DISTRESS AND THEN SHE THOUGHT AND THOUGHT TILL AT LAST SHE THOUGHT OF THE LARK AND SHE FANCIED THAT BECAUSE HE WENT UP SO HIGH AND NOBODY KNEW WHERE HE WENT TO
8123-275209-0011 HE MUST BE VERY CLEVER AND KNOW A GREAT DEAL FOR TO GO UP VERY HIGH WHICH SHE COULD NEVER DO WAS THE CATERPILLAR'S IDEA OF PERFECT GLORY NOW IN THE NEIGHBOURING CORN FIELD THEIR LIVED A LARK
8123-275209-0012 AND THE CATERPILLAR SENT A MESSAGE TO HIM TO BEG HIM TO COME AND TALK TO HER AND WHEN HE CAME SHE TOLD HIM ALL HER DIFFICULTIES AND ASKED HIM WHAT SHE WAS TO DO TO FEED AND REAR THE LITTLE CREATURES SO DIFFERENT FROM HERSELF
8123-275209-0013 PERHAPS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO INQUIRE AND HEAR SOMETHING ABOUT IT NEXT TIME YOU GO UP HIGH OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR TIMIDLY THE LARK SAID PERHAPS HE SHOULD BUT HE DID NOT SATISFY HER CURIOSITY ANY FURTHER
8123-275209-0014 SOON AFTERWARDS HOWEVER HE WENT SINGING UPWARDS INTO THE BRIGHT BLUE SKY BY DEGREES HIS VOICE DIED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TILL THE GREEN CATERPILLAR COULD NOT HEAR A SOUND
8123-275209-0015 SO SHE RESUMED HER WALK ROUND THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS NIBBLING A BIT OF THE CABBAGE LEAF NOW AND THEN AS SHE MOVED ALONG
8123-275209-0016 I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD OBSERVED THE CATERPILLAR HASTILY WELL THEN FIRST OF ALL I WILL TELL YOU WHAT THESE LITTLE CREATURES ARE TO EAT WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS TO BE GUESS
8123-275209-0017 DEW AND THE HONEY OUT OF FLOWERS I AM AFRAID SIGHED THE CATERPILLAR NO SUCH THING OLD LADY SOMETHING SIMPLER THAN THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU CAN GET AT QUITE EASILY
8123-275209-0018 NEVER SAID THE CATERPILLAR INDIGNANTLY IT WAS THEIR DYING MOTHER'S LAST REQUEST THAT I SHOULD DO NO SUCH THING THEIR DYING MOTHER KNEW NOTHING ABOUT THE MATTER PERSISTED THE LARK
8123-275209-0019 BUT WHY DO YOU ASK ME AND THEN DISBELIEVE WHAT I SAY YOU HAVE NEITHER FAITH NOR TRUST OH I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD SAID THE CATERPILLAR NAY BUT YOU DO NOT REPLIED THE LARK YOU WON'T BELIEVE ME EVEN ABOUT THE FOOD
8123-275209-0020 AND YET THAT IS BUT A BEGINNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO TELL YOU WHY CATERPILLAR WHAT DO YOU THINK THOSE LITTLE EGGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE BUTTERFLIES TO BE SURE SAID THE CATERPILLAR CATERPILLARS SANG THE LARK
8123-275209-0021 BUT I FIND THAT HE IS FOOLISH AND SAUCY INSTEAD
8123-275209-0022 I WOULD TELL YOU IF YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME SANG THE LARK DESCENDING ONCE MORE I BELIEVE EVERYTHING I AM TOLD REITERATED THE CATERPILLAR WITH AS GRAVE A FACE AS IF IT WERE A FACT
8123-275209-0023 THEN I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE CRIED THE LARK FOR THE BEST OF MY NEWS REMAINS BEHIND YOU WILL ONE DAY BE A BUTTERFLY YOURSELF WRETCHED BIRD EXCLAIMED THE CATERPILLAR
8123-275209-0024 YOU JEST WITH MY INFERIORITY NOW YOU ARE CRUEL AS WELL AS FOOLISH
8123-275209-0025 I WILL ASK YOUR ADVICE NO MORE I TOLD YOU YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE ME CRIED THE LARK NETTLED IN HIS TURN I BELIEVE EVERYTHING THAT I AM TOLD PERSISTED THE CATERPILLAR THAT IS
8123-275209-0026 I SEE SO MANY WONDERFUL THINGS I KNOW NO REASON WHY THERE SHOULD NOT BE MORE OH CATERPILLAR IT IS BECAUSE YOU CRAWL BECAUSE YOU NEVER GET BEYOND YOUR CABBAGE LEAF THAT YOU CALL ANY THING IMPOSSIBLE
8123-275209-0027 AS WELL AS YOU DO LOOK AT MY LONG GREEN BODY AND THESE ENDLESS LEGS AND THEN TALK TO ME ABOUT HAVING WINGS AND A PAINTED FEATHERY COAT FOOL AND FOOL YOU CRIED THE INDIGNANT LARK
8123-275209-0028 OH CATERPILLAR WHAT COMES TO YOU FROM THENCE RECEIVE AS I DO
8123-275209-0029 INTERRUPTED THE LARK HOW AM I TO LEARN FAITH ASKED THE CATERPILLAR AT THAT MOMENT SHE FELT SOMETHING AT HER SIDE SHE LOOKED ROUND EIGHT OR TEN LITTLE GREEN CATERPILLARS WERE MOVING ABOUT
8123-275209-0030 AND HAD ALREADY MADE A SHOW OF A HOLE IN THE CABBAGE LEAF THEY HAD BROKEN FROM THE BUTTERFLY'S EGGS SHAME AND AMAZEMENT FILLED OUR GREEN FRIEND'S HEART BUT JOY SOON FOLLOWED
8123-275209-0031 FOR AS THE FIRST WONDER WAS POSSIBLE THE SECOND MIGHT BE SO TOO TEACH ME YOUR LESSON LARK SHE WOULD SAY AND THE LARK SANG TO HER OF THE WONDERS OF THE EARTH BELOW AND OF THE HEAVEN ABOVE
8123-275209-0032 AND THE CATERPILLAR TALKED ALL THE REST OF HER LIFE TO HER RELATIONS OF THE TIME WHEN SHE SHOULD BE A BUTTERFLY BUT NONE OF THEM BELIEVED HER SHE NEVERTHELESS HAD LEARNT THE LARK'S LESSON OF FAITH
8123-275209-0033 AND WHEN SHE WAS GOING INTO HER CHRYSALIS GRAVE SHE SAID I SHALL BE A BUTTERFLY SOME DAY BUT HER RELATIONS THOUGHT HER HEAD WAS WANDERING AND THEY SAID POOR THING
8123-275209-0034 AND WHEN SHE WAS A BUTTERFLY AND WAS GOING TO DIE AGAIN SHE SAID
8123-275216-0000 TREES BUT TREES THERE WERE IN PLENTY THEY STOOD EVERYWHERE FROM COAST TO COAST THEY SAW THEMSELVES REFLECTED IN ALL THE RIVERS AND LAKES AND STRETCHED THEIR MIGHTY BOUGHS UP TOWARDS HEAVEN
8123-275216-0001 WE ARE ALL OAK TREES THEY SAID WE OWN THE LAND AND RULE OVER IT AND THEY WERE RIGHT THERE WERE ONLY A FEW HUMAN BEINGS THERE IN THOSE DAYS AND THOSE THAT THERE WERE WERE NOTHING BETTER THAN WILD ANIMALS
8123-275216-0002 THE BEAR THE WOLF AND THE FOX WENT OUT HUNTING WHILE THE STAG GRAZED BY THE EDGE OF THE FEN THE FIELD MOUSE SAT OUTSIDE HIS HOLE AND ATE ACORNS AND THE BEAVER BUILT HIS ARTISTIC HOUSES BY THE RIVER BANKS
8123-275216-0003 ONE DAY THE BEAR CAME TRUDGING ALONG AND LAY DOWN AT FULL BREADTH UNDER A GREAT OAK TREE ARE YOU THERE AGAIN YOU ROBBER SAID THE OAK AND SHOOK A LOT OF WITHERED LEAVES DOWN OVER HIM YOU SHOULD NOT SQUANDER YOUR LEAVES MY OLD FRIEND

8123-275216-0016 THE SNOW LAY HIGH OVER THE WHOLE LAND AND EVERY TREE STOOD DEEP IN HIS OWN THOUGHTS AND DREAMT OF THE SPRING AND WHEN THE SPRING CAME THE GRASS STOOD GREEN AND THE BIRDS BEGAN SINGING WHERE THEY LEFT OFF LAST
8123-275216-0017 THE KINGS OF THE WOOD DO NOT COME TILL THE WHOLE COMPANY IS ASSEMBLED BUT AT LAST THEY CAME ALL THE LEAVES BURST FORTH FROM THE SWOLLEN BUDS AND THE TREES LOOKED AT ONE ANOTHER AND COMPLIMENTED ONE ANOTHER ON THEIR BEAUTY
8123-275216-0018 AND EVERY MORNING WHEN THE SUN CAME OUT THEY PEEPED DOWN TO LOOK FOR THE BEECHES THEY WERE REALLY A LITTLE UNEASY BUT THEY WERE TOO PROUD TO TALK ABOUT IT AND ONE DAY THE LITTLE SHOOTS DID AT LAST BURST FORTH FROM THE EARTH
8123-275216-0019 THE SUN SHONE ON THEM AND THE RAIN FELL ON THEM SO IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY GREW TALL OH HOW PRETTY THEY ARE SAID THE GREAT OAK AND STOOPED HIS CROOKED BOUGHS STILL MORE SO THAT THEY COULD GET A GOOD VIEW OF THEM

8123-275216-0025 THE BEECHES ONLY LAUGHED AND WENT ON GROWING AT LAST THEY CLOSED TOGETHER OVER THE LITTLE OAK'S HEAD AND THEN HE DIED THAT WAS A HORRID THING TO DO
8123-275216-0026 A GREAT OAK CALLED OUT AND SHOOK HIS BOUGHS IN TERROR BUT THE OLD OAK TOOK HIS FOSTER CHILDREN UNDER HIS PROTECTION IT SERVES HIM RIGHT HE SAID HE IS PAID OUT FOR HIS BOASTING
8123-275216-0027 YOU BEGIN TO BE RATHER PUSHING THE OLD TREE SAID YOU SHOULD TRY TO GROW A LITTLE BROADER AND STOP THIS SHOOTING UP INTO THE AIR JUST SEE WHERE YOUR BRANCHES ARE SOARING

8123-275216-0030 THAT IS NOT A POLITE WAY OF SPEAKING TO AN OLD TREE WITH MOSS ON HIS BOUGHS SAID THE OAK I BEGIN TO REPENT THAT I WAS SO KIND TO YOU IF YOU HAVE A SPARK OF HONOURABLE FEELING ALIVE IN YOU
8123-275216-0031 BE GOOD ENOUGH TO MOVE YOUR LEAVES A LITTLE TO ONE SIDE THERE HAVE BEEN SCARCELY ANY BUDS ON MY LOWEST BRANCHES THIS YEAR YOU OVERSHADOW ME SO I DON'T QUITE UNDERSTAND HOW THAT CONCERNS US ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8123-275216-0032 EVERY ONE HAS QUITE ENOUGH TO DO TO LOOK AFTER HIMSELF IF HE IS EQUAL TO HIS WORK AND HAS LUCK IT TURNS OUT WELL FOR HIM IF NOT HE MUST BE PREPARED TO GO TO THE WALL THAT IS THE WAY OF THE WORLD
8123-275216-0033 THEN THE OAK'S LOWEST BRANCH DIED AND HE BEGAN TO BE SERIOUSLY ALARMED YOU ARE PRETTY THINGS HE SAID IF THIS IS THE WAY YOU REWARD ME FOR MY HOSPITALITY WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE I LET YOU GROW AT MY FEET
8123-275216-0034 AND SHELTERED YOU AGAINST THE STORM I LET THE SUN SHINE ON YOU AS MUCH AS EVER HE WOULD AND I TREATED YOU AS IF YOU WERE MY OWN CHILDREN AND IN RETURN FOR ALL THIS YOU STIFLE ME STUFF AND NONSENSE
8123-275216-0035 SAID THE BEECHES SO THEY PUT FORTH FLOWERS AND FRUIT AND WHEN THE FRUIT WAS RIPE THE WIND SHOOK THE BOUGHS AND SCATTERED IT ROUND FAR AND WIDE YOU ARE QUICK PEOPLE LIKE ME SAID THE WIND I LIKE YOU FOR IT
8123-275216-0036 AND AM GLAD TO DO YOU A GOOD TURN AND THE FOX ROLLED ON THE GROUND AT THE FOOT OF THE BEECH TREES AND GOT HIS FUR FULL OF THE PRICKLY FRUITS AND RAN WITH THEM FAR OUT INTO THE COUNTRY THE BEAR DID THE SAME
8123-275216-0037 AND GRINNED INTO THE BARGAIN AT THE OLD OAK WHILE HE LAY AND RESTED IN THE SHADOW OF THE BEECHES THE FIELD MOUSE WAS BESIDE HIMSELF WITH JOY OVER HIS NEW FOOD AND THOUGHT THAT BEECH NUTS TASTED MUCH NICER THAN ACORNS
8123-275216-0038 ALL ROUND NEW LITTLE BEECH TREES SHOT UP WHICH GREW JUST AS FAST AS THEIR PARENTS AND LOOKED AS GREEN AND AS HAPPY AS IF THEY DID NOT KNOW WHAT AN UNEASY CONSCIENCE WAS
8123-275216-0039 BUT THE OLD OAK GAZED SADLY OUT OVER THE WOOD THE LIGHT GREEN BEECH LEAVES WERE PEEPING OUT EVERYWHERE AND THE OAKS WERE SIGHING AND BEWAILING THEIR DISTRESS TO ONE ANOTHER
8123-275216-0040 THEY ARE TAKING OUR STRENGTH OUT OF US THEY SAID AND SHOOK AS MUCH AS THE BEECHES AROUND WOULD LET THEM THE LAND IS OURS NO LONGER ONE BOUGH DIED AFTER ANOTHER
8123-275216-0041 AND THE STORM BROKE THEM OFF AND CAST THEM ON THE GROUND THE OLD OAK HAD NOW ONLY A FEW LEAVES LEFT AT THE VERY TOP THE END IS NEAR HE SAID GRAVELY
8123-275216-0042 BY THIS TIME THERE WERE MANY MORE HUMAN BEINGS IN THE LAND THAN THERE WERE BEFORE AND THEY MADE HASTE TO HEW DOWN THE OAKS WHILE THERE WERE STILL SOME REMAINING OAK TIMBER IS BETTER THAN BEECH TIMBER THEY SAID
8123-275216-0043 AT LAST WE GET A LITTLE APPRECIATION SAID THE OLD OAK BUT WE HAVE TO PAY FOR IT WITH OUR LIVES THEN HE SAID TO THE BEECH TREES WHAT WAS I THINKING OF WHEN I HELPED YOU ON IN YOUR YOUNG DAYS
8123-275216-0044 WHAT AN OLD STUPID I WAS BEFORE THAT WE OAK TREES WERE LORDS IN THE LAND AND NOW EVERY YEAR I SEE MY BROTHERS AROUND ME PERISHING IN THE FIGHT AGAINST YOU IT WILL SOON BE ALL OVER WITH ME
8123-275216-0045 AND NOT ONE OF MY ACORNS HAS SPROUTED UNDER YOUR SHADE BUT BEFORE I DIE I SHOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE NAME YOU GIVE TO SUCH CONDUCT THAT WILL NOT TAKE LONG TO SAY OLD FRIEND ANSWERED THE BEECHES
8226-274369-0000 EVERY MEASURE PURSUED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0001 BESIDES NUMBERLESS VEXATIONS AND PERSECUTIONS WHICH THE CLERGY UNDERWENT FROM THE ARBITRARY POWER OF THE LOWER HOUSE THE PEERS WHILE THE KING WAS IN SCOTLAND
8226-274369-0002 HAVING PASSED AN ORDER FOR THE OBSERVANCE OF THE LAWS WITH REGARD TO PUBLIC WORSHIP THE COMMONS ASSUMED SUCH AUTHORITY THAT BY A VOTE ALONE OF THEIR HOUSE THEY SUSPENDED THOSE LAWS THOUGH ENACTED BY THE WHOLE LEGISLATURE
8226-274369-0003 THEY COMPLAINED OF THE KING'S FILLING FIVE VACANT SEES AND CONSIDERED IT AS AN INSULT UPON THEM
8226-274369-0004 THEY MADE A DEMAND THE MOST ABSURD IN THE WORLD THAT THE BISHOPS BEING ALL OF THEM PARTIES SHOULD BE REFUSED A VOTE WITH REGARD TO THAT QUESTION AFTER THE RESOLUTION WAS ONCE FORMED BY THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0005 OF INVADING THE ESTABLISHED GOVERNMENT OF CHURCH AND STATE IT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED THAT THEIR PROCEEDINGS IN SUCH A VIOLENT ATTEMPT WOULD THENCEFORTH BE ALTOGETHER REGULAR AND EQUITABLE BUT IT MUST BE CONFESSED THAT
8226-274369-0006 IN THEIR ATTACK ON THE HIERARCHY THEY STILL MORE OPENLY PASSED ALL BOUNDS OF MODERATION AS SUPPOSING NO DOUBT
8226-274369-0007 HAD ALREADY RISEN TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND GAVE SUFFICIENT WARNING OF THEIR FUTURE ATTEMPTS UPON THAT ORDER THEY MUTTERED SOMEWHAT OF THEIR REGRET THAT THEY SHOULD BE OBLIGED TO SAVE THE KINGDOM ALONE
8226-274369-0008 AND THAT THE HOUSE OF PEERS WOULD HAVE NO PART IN THE HONOR NAY THEY WENT SO FAR AS OPENLY TO TELL THE LORDS THAT THEY THEMSELVES WERE THE REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE WHOLE KINGDOM
8226-274369-0009 AND THAT THE PEERS WERE NOTHING BUT INDIVIDUALS WHO HELD THEIR SEATS IN A PARTICULAR CAPACITY AND THEREFORE IF THEIR LORDSHIPS WILL NOT CONSENT TO THE PASSING OF ACTS NECESSARY FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE PEOPLE THE COMMONS
8226-274369-0010 TOGETHER WITH SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ARE MORE SENSIBLE OF THE DANGER MUST JOIN TOGETHER AND REPRESENT THE MATTER TO HIS MAJESTY SO VIOLENT WAS THE DEMOCRATICAL ENTHUSIASTIC SPIRIT DIFFUSED THROUGHOUT THE NATION
8226-274369-0011 THAT A TOTAL CONFUSION OF ALL RANK AND ORDER WAS JUSTLY TO BE APPREHENDED AND THE WONDER WAS NOT THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE NOBLES SHOULD SEEK SHELTER UNDER THE THRONE
8226-274369-0012 BUT THE TIDE OF POPULARITY SEIZED MANY AND CARRIED THEM WIDE OF THE MOST ESTABLISHED MAXIMS OF CIVIL POLICY AMONG THE OPPONENTS OF THE KING ARE RANKED THE EARL OF NORTHUMBERLAND LORD ADMIRAL A MAN OF THE FIRST FAMILY AND FORTUNE
8226-274369-0013 AND ENDOWED WITH THAT DIGNIFIED PRIDE WHICH SO WELL BECAME HIS RANK AND STATION THE EARL OF ESSEX WHO INHERITED ALL HIS FATHER'S POPULARITY AND HAVING FROM HIS EARLY YOUTH SOUGHT RENOWN IN ARMS
8226-274369-0014 UNITED TO A MIDDLING CAPACITY THAT RIGID INFLEXIBILITY OF HONOR WHICH FORMS THE PROPER ORNAMENT OF A NOBLEMAN AND A SOLDIER LORD KIMBOLTON SOON AFTER EARL OF MANCHESTER A PERSON DISTINGUISHED BY HUMANITY GENEROSITY
8226-274369-0015 AFFABILITY AND EVERY AMIABLE VIRTUE THESE MEN FINDING THAT THEIR CREDIT RAN HIGH WITH THE NATION VENTURED TO ENCOURAGE THOSE POPULAR DISORDERS WHICH THEY VAINLY IMAGINED
8226-274369-0016 THEY POSSESSED AUTHORITY SUFFICIENT TO REGULATE AND CONTROL IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A MAJORITY IN THE UPPER HOUSE THE COMMONS HAD RECOURSE TO THE POPULACE WHO ON OTHER OCCASIONS HAD DONE THEM SUCH IMPORTANT SERVICE
8226-274369-0017 AMIDST THE GREATEST SECURITY THEY AFFECTED CONTINUAL FEARS OF DESTRUCTION TO THEMSELVES AND THE NATION AND SEEMED TO QUAKE AT EVERY BREATH OR RUMOR OF DANGER
8226-274369-0018 HOWEVER RIDICULOUS WERE WILLINGLY ATTENDED TO AND WERE DISPERSED AMONG THE MULTITUDE TO WHOSE CAPACITY THEY WERE WELL ADAPTED BEALE A TAILOR INFORMED THE COMMONS THAT WALKING IN THE FIELDS
8226-274369-0019 HE HAD HEARKENED TO THE DISCOURSE OF CERTAIN PERSONS UNKNOWN TO HIM AND HAD HEARD THEM TALK OF A MOST DANGEROUS CONSPIRACY A HUNDRED AND EIGHT RUFFIANS AS HE LEARNED HAD BEEN APPOINTED TO MURDER A HUNDRED AND EIGHT LORDS AND COMMONERS
8226-274369-0020 AND WERE PROMISED REWARDS FOR THESE ASSASSINATIONS
8226-274369-0021 FORTY SHILLINGS FOR EACH COMMONER UPON THIS NOTABLE INTELLIGENCE ORDERS WERE ISSUED FOR SEIZING PRIESTS AND JESUITS A CONFERENCE WAS DESIRED WITH THE LORDS
8226-274369-0022 AND THE DEPUTY LIEUTENANTS OF SOME SUSPECTED COUNTIES WERE ORDERED TO PUT THE PEOPLE IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE THE PULPITS LIKEWISE WERE CALLED IN AID
8226-274369-0023 AND RESOUNDED WITH THE DANGERS WHICH THREATENED RELIGION FROM THE DESPERATE ATTEMPTS OF PAPISTS AND MALIGNANTS MULTITUDES FLOCKED TOWARDS WESTMINSTER AND INSULTED THE PRELATES AND SUCH OF THE LORDS AS ADHERED TO THE CROWN
8226-274369-0024 THE PEERS VOTED A DECLARATION AGAINST THOSE TUMULTS AND SENT IT TO THE LOWER HOUSE BUT THESE REFUSED THEIR CONCURRENCE SOME SEDITIOUS APPRENTICES BEING SEIZED AND COMMITTED TO PRISON IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED THEIR LIBERTY
8226-274369-0025 DURING THIS TIME OF DISORDER AND DANGER OFFERED THEIR SERVICE TO THE KING BETWEEN THEM AND THE POPULACE THERE PASSED FREQUENT SKIRMISHES WHICH ENDED NOT WITHOUT BLOODSHED BY WAY OF REPROACH
8226-274369-0026 THESE GENTLEMEN GAVE THE RABBLE THE APPELLATION OF ROUNDHEADS ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORT CROPPED HAIR WHICH THEY WORE THESE CALLED THE OTHERS CAVALIERS AND THUS THE NATION
8226-274369-0027 WHICH WAS BEFORE SUFFICIENTLY PROVIDED WITH RELIGIOUS AS WELL AS CIVIL CAUSES OF QUARREL WAS ALSO SUPPLIED WITH PARTY NAMES UNDER WHICH THE FACTIONS MIGHT RENDEZVOUS AND SIGNALIZE THEIR MUTUAL HATRED
8226-274369-0028 BEING DISTINGUISHABLE BY THEIR HABIT AND BEING THE OBJECT OF VIOLENT HATRED TO ALL THE SECTARIES WERE EXPOSED TO THE MOST DANGEROUS INSULTS WILLIAMS NOW CREATED ARCHBISHOP OF YORK
8226-274369-0029 THAT THOUGH THEY HAD AN UNDOUBTED RIGHT TO SIT AND VOTE IN PARLIAMENT YET IN COMING THITHER THEY HAD BEEN MENACED ASSAULTED AFFRONTED BY THE UNRULY MULTITUDE AND COULD NO LONGER WITH SAFETY ATTEND THEIR DUTY IN THE HOUSE
8226-274369-0030 FOR THIS REASON THEY PROTESTED AGAINST ALL LAWS VOTES AND RESOLUTIONS AS NULL AND INVALID WHICH SHOULD PASS DURING THE TIME OF THEIR CONSTRAINED ABSENCE THIS PROTESTATION WHICH
8226-274369-0031 THAT HOUSE DESIRED A CONFERENCE WITH THE COMMONS WHOM THEY INFORMED OF THIS UNEXPECTED PROTESTATION THE OPPORTUNITY WAS SEIZED WITH JOY AND TRIUMPH
8226-274369-0032 THE KING WAS BETRAYED INTO ANOTHER INDISCRETION MUCH MORE FATAL AN INDISCRETION TO WHICH ALL THE ENSUING DISORDERS AND CIVIL WARS OUGHT IMMEDIATELY AND DIRECTLY TO BE ASCRIBED
8226-274369-0033 THIS WAS THE IMPEACHMENT OF LORD KIMBOLTON AND THE FIVE MEMBERS WHEN THE COMMONS EMPLOYED IN THEIR REMONSTRANCE LANGUAGE SO SEVERE AND INDECENT THEY HAD NOT BEEN ACTUATED ENTIRELY BY INSOLENCE AND PASSION
8226-274369-0034 THEIR VIEWS WERE MORE SOLID AND PROFOUND THEY CONSIDERED THAT IN A VIOLENT ATTEMPT SUCH AS AN INVASION OF THE ANCIENT CONSTITUTION THE MORE LEISURE WAS AFFORDED THE PEOPLE TO REFLECT
8226-274369-0035 THE LESS WOULD THEY BE INCLINED TO SECOND THAT RASH AND DANGEROUS ENTERPRISE THAT THE PEERS WOULD CERTAINLY REFUSE THEIR CONCURRENCE NOR WERE THERE ANY HOPES OF PREVAILING ON THEM BUT BY INSTIGATING THE POPULACE TO TUMULT AND DISORDER
8226-274369-0036 THAT THE EMPLOYING OF SUCH ODIOUS MEANS FOR SO INVIDIOUS AN END WOULD AT LONG RUN LOSE THEM ALL THEIR POPULARITY AND TURN THE TIDE OF FAVOR TO THE CONTRARY PARTY AND THAT IF THE KING ONLY REMAINED IN TRANQUILLITY
8226-274369-0037 THEY WERE THEREFORE RESOLVED IF POSSIBLE TO EXCITE HIM TO SOME VIOLENT PASSION
8226-274369-0038 IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THEY SUCCEEDED BEYOND THEIR FONDEST WISHES CHARLES WAS ENRAGED TO FIND THAT ALL HIS CONCESSIONS BUT INCREASED THEIR DEMANDS
8226-274369-0039 WERE AGAIN ROUSED TO SEDITION AND TUMULTS THAT THE BLACKEST CALUMNIES WERE PROPAGATED AGAINST HIM AND EVEN THE IRISH MASSACRE ASCRIBED TO HIS COUNSELS AND MACHINATIONS
8226-274369-0040 HE WAS APT TO ASCRIBE THEM IN A GREAT MEASURE TO HIS OWN INDOLENCE AND FACILITY THE QUEEN AND THE LADIES OF THE COURT FURTHER STIMULATED HIS PASSION AND REPRESENTED THAT
8226-274369-0041 IF HE EXERTED THE VIGOR AND DISPLAYED THE MAJESTY OF A MONARCH THE DARING USURPATIONS OF HIS SUBJECTS WOULD SHRINK BEFORE HIM LORD DIGBY A MAN OF FINE PARTS BUT FULL OF LEVITY AND HURRIED ON BY PRECIPITATE PASSIONS
8226-274369-0042 THAT THEY HAD TRAITOROUSLY ENDEAVORED TO SUBVERT THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS AND GOVERNMENT OF THE KINGDOM TO DEPRIVE THE KING OF HIS REGAL POWER AND TO IMPOSE ON HIS SUBJECTS AN ARBITRARY AND TYRANNICAL AUTHORITY THAT THEY HAD ENDEAVORED
8226-274369-0043 BY MANY FOUL ASPERSIONS ON HIS MAJESTY AND HIS GOVERNMENT TO ALIENATE THE AFFECTIONS OF HIS PEOPLE AND MAKE HIM ODIOUS TO THEM THAT THEY HAD ATTEMPTED TO DRAW HIS LATE ARMY TO DISOBEDIENCE OF HIS ROYAL COMMANDS
8226-274369-0044 AND TO SIDE WITH THEM IN THEIR TRAITOROUS DESIGNS
8226-274369-0045 SEEM TO BE COMMON BETWEEN THE IMPEACHED MEMBERS AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274369-0046 THAN SO FAR AS THEY CONCURRED WITH THE MAJORITY IN THEIR VOTES AND SPEECHES THOUGH PROOFS MIGHT PERHAPS BE PRODUCED OF THEIR PRIVATELY INVITING THE SCOTS TO INVADE ENGLAND
8226-274369-0047 HOW COULD SUCH AN ATTEMPT BE CONSIDERED AS TREASON AFTER THE ACT OF OBLIVION WHICH HAD PASSED AND AFTER THAT BOTH HOUSES WITH THE KING'S CONCURRENCE HAD VOTED THAT NATION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND POUNDS FOR THEIR BROTHERLY ASSISTANCE
8226-274369-0048 WHILE THE HOUSE OF PEERS ARE SCARCELY ABLE TO MAINTAIN THEIR INDEPENDENCY OR TO REJECT THE BILLS SENT THEM BY THE COMMONS WILL THEY EVER BE PERMITTED BY THE POPULACE SUPPOSING THEM INCLINED
8226-274369-0049 BUT SURELY WAS NEVER BEFORE ATTEMPTED IN OPPOSITION TO A FACTION DURING THE FULL TIDE OF ITS POWER AND SUCCESS BUT MEN HAD NOT LEISURE TO WONDER AT THE INDISCRETION OF THIS MEASURE
8226-274369-0050 MESSENGERS WERE EMPLOYED TO SEARCH FOR THEM AND ARREST THEM THEIR TRUNKS CHAMBERS AND STUDIES WERE SEALED AND LOCKED THE HOUSE VOTED ALL THESE ACTS OF VIOLENCE TO BE BREACHES OF PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0051 AND COMMANDED EVERY ONE TO DEFEND THE LIBERTY OF THE MEMBERS THE KING IRRITATED BY ALL THIS OPPOSITION RESOLVED NEXT DAY TO COME IN PERSON TO THE HOUSE WITH AN INTENTION TO DEMAND PERHAPS SEIZE IN THEIR PRESENCE
8226-274369-0052 THE PERSONS WHOM HE HAD ACCUSED THIS RESOLUTION WAS DISCOVERED TO THE COUNTESS OF CARLISLE SISTER TO NORTHUMBERLAND A LADY OF SPIRIT WIT AND INTRIGUE SHE PRIVATELY SENT INTELLIGENCE TO THE FIVE MEMBERS
8226-274369-0053 AND THEY HAD TIME TO WITHDRAW A MOMENT BEFORE THE KING ENTERED HE WAS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS ORDINARY RETINUE TO THE NUMBER OF ABOVE TWO HUNDRED ARMED AS USUAL SOME WITH HALBERTS
8226-274369-0054 YESTERDAY I SENT A SERJEANT AT ARMS TO DEMAND SOME WHO BY MY ORDER WERE ACCUSED OF HIGH TREASON INSTEAD OF OBEDIENCE I RECEIVED A MESSAGE I MUST HERE DECLARE TO YOU
8226-274369-0055 THAT THOUGH NO KING THAT EVER WAS IN ENGLAND COULD BE MORE CAREFUL OF YOUR PRIVILEGES THAN I SHALL BE YET IN CASES OF TREASON NO PERSON HAS PRIVILEGE
8226-274369-0056 I NEVER DID INTEND ANY FORCE BUT SHALL PROCEED AGAINST THEM IN A FAIR AND LEGAL WAY FOR I NEVER MEANT ANY OTHER AND NOW SINCE I SEE I CANNOT DO WHAT I CAME FOR
8226-274369-0057 HE ASKED THE SPEAKER WHO STOOD BELOW WHETHER ANY OF THESE PERSONS WERE IN THE HOUSE THE SPEAKER FALLING ON HIS KNEE PRUDENTLY REPLIED I HAVE SIR
8226-274369-0058 NEITHER EYES TO SEE NOR TONGUE TO SPEAK IN THIS PLACE BUT AS THE HOUSE IS PLEASED TO DIRECT ME WHOSE SERVANT I AM AND I HUMBLY ASK PARDON
8226-274369-0059 WHO WERE APPOINTED FOR THAT PURPOSE OR PERHAPS ACTUATED BY THEIR OWN TERRORS RAN FROM GATE TO GATE CRYING OUT THAT THE CAVALIERS WERE COMING TO BURN THE CITY AND THAT THE KING HIMSELF WAS AT THEIR HEAD
8226-274369-0060 NEXT MORNING CHARLES SENT TO THE MAYOR AND ORDERED HIM TO CALL A COMMON COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK HE HIMSELF ATTENDED ONLY BY THREE OR FOUR LORDS WENT TO GUILDHALL
8226-274369-0061 HE TOLD THE COMMON COUNCIL THAT HE WAS SORRY TO HEAR OF THE APPREHENSIONS ENTERTAINED OF HIM THAT HE WAS COME TO THEM WITHOUT ANY GUARD IN ORDER TO SHOW HOW MUCH HE RELIED ON THEIR AFFECTIONS
8226-274369-0062 AND THAT HE HAD ACCUSED CERTAIN MEN OF HIGH TREASON AGAINST WHOM HE WOULD PROCEED IN A LEGAL WAY AND THEREFORE PRESUMED THAT THEY WOULD NOT MEET WITH PROTECTION IN THE CITY AFTER MANY OTHER GRACIOUS EXPRESSIONS
8226-274369-0063 HE HEARD THE CRY PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT PRIVILEGE OF PARLIAMENT RESOUNDING FROM ALL QUARTERS
8226-274371-0000 YOU SPEAK OF JEALOUSIES AND FEARS LAY YOUR HANDS ON YOUR HEARTS AND ASK YOURSELVES WHETHER I MAY NOT LIKEWISE BE DISTURBED WITH FEARS AND JEALOUSIES AND IF SO I ASSURE YOU THAT THIS MESSAGE HAS NOTHING LESSENED THEM
8226-274371-0001 WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE HAVE I VIOLATED YOUR LAWS HAVE I DENIED TO PASS ANY BILL FOR THE EASE AND SECURITY OF MY SUBJECTS I DO NOT ASK WHAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME
8226-274371-0002 ALL THIS CONSIDERED THERE IS A JUDGMENT OF HEAVEN UPON THIS NATION IF THESE DISTRACTIONS CONTINUE GOD SO DEAL WITH ME AND MINE AS ALL MY THOUGHTS AND INTENTIONS ARE UPRIGHT FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE TRUE PROTESTANT PROFESSION
8226-274371-0003 AND FOR THE OBSERVANCE AND PRESERVATION OF THE LAWS AND I HOPE GOD WILL BLESS AND ASSIST THOSE LAWS FOR MY PRESERVATION NO SOONER DID THE COMMONS DESPAIR OF OBTAINING THE KING'S CONSENT TO THEIR BILL THAN THEY INSTANTLY VOTED
8226-274371-0004 THAT THOSE WHO ADVISED HIS MAJESTY'S ANSWER WERE ENEMIES TO THE STATE AND MISCHIEVOUS PROJECTORS AGAINST THE SAFETY OF THE NATION THAT THIS DENIAL IS OF SUCH DANGEROUS CONSEQUENCE THAT IF HIS MAJESTY PERSIST IN IT
8226-274371-0005 IT WILL HAZARD THE PEACE AND TRANQUILLITY OF ALL HIS KINGDOMS UNLESS SOME SPEEDY REMEDY BE APPLIED BY THE WISDOM AND AUTHORITY OF BOTH HOUSES AND THAT SUCH OF THE SUBJECTS AS HAVE PUT THEMSELVES IN A POSTURE OF DEFENCE AGAINST THE COMMON DANGER
8226-274371-0006 WITH THE TERRORS OF INVASION WITH THE DREAD OF ENGLISH AND IRISH PAPISTS AND THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE PANICS WERE SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE NATION LORD DIGBY HAVING ENTERED KINGSTON IN A COACH AND SIX
8226-274371-0007 ATTENDED BY A FEW LIVERY SERVANTS THE INTELLIGENCE WAS CONVEYED TO LONDON AND IT WAS IMMEDIATELY VOTED THAT HE HAD APPEARED IN A HOSTILE MANNER TO THE TERROR AND AFFRIGHT OF HIS MAJESTY'S SUBJECTS
8226-274371-0008 HAD BEEN SUFFICIENT TO OPEN THE EYES OF MANY AND TO RECOVER THEM FROM THE ASTONISHMENT WITH WHICH AT FIRST THEY HAD BEEN SEIZED
8226-274371-0009 AND THEY PROCEEDED TO FRAME AN ORDINANCE IN WHICH BY THE AUTHORITY OF THE TWO HOUSES WITHOUT THE KING'S CONSENT THEY NAMED LIEUTENANTS FOR ALL THE COUNTIES AND CONFERRED ON THEM THE COMMAND OF THE WHOLE MILITARY FORCE OF ALL THE GUARDS
8226-274371-0010 GARRISONS AND FORTS OF THE KINGDOM HE ISSUED PROCLAMATIONS AGAINST THIS MANIFEST USURPATION
8226-274371-0011 AS HE PROFESSED A RESOLUTION STRICTLY TO OBSERVE THE LAW HIMSELF SO WAS HE DETERMINED HE SAID TO OBLIGE EVERY OTHER PERSON TO PAY IT A LIKE OBEDIENCE THE NAME OF THE KING WAS SO ESSENTIAL TO ALL LAWS
8226-274371-0012 AND SO FAMILIAR IN ALL ACTS OF EXECUTIVE AUTHORITY THAT THE PARLIAMENT WAS AFRAID HAD THEY TOTALLY OMITTED IT THAT THE INNOVATION WOULD BE TOO SENSIBLE TO THE PEOPLE IN ALL COMMANDS THEREFORE WHICH THEY CONFERRED
8226-274371-0013 THEY BOUND THE PERSONS TO OBEY THE ORDERS OF HIS MAJESTY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT AND INVENTING A DISTINCTION HITHERTO UNHEARD OF BETWEEN THE OFFICE AND THE PERSON OF THE KING
8226-274371-0014 THOSE VERY FORCES WHICH THEY EMPLOYED AGAINST HIM THEY LEVIED IN HIS NAME AND BY HIS AUTHORITY IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MUCH THE TOPICS OF ARGUMENT WERE NOW REVERSED BETWEEN THE PARTIES THE KING
8226-274371-0015 WHILE HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIS FORMER ERROR OF EMPLOYING A PLEA OF NECESSITY IN ORDER TO INFRINGE THE LAWS AND CONSTITUTION WARNED THE PARLIAMENT NOT TO IMITATE AN EXAMPLE ON WHICH THEY THREW SUCH VIOLENT BLAME AND THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0016 WHILE THEY CLOTHED THEIR PERSONAL FEARS OR AMBITION UNDER THE APPEARANCE OF NATIONAL AND IMMINENT DANGER MADE UNKNOWINGLY AN APOLOGY FOR THE MOST EXCEPTIONABLE PART OF THE KING'S CONDUCT
8226-274371-0017 THAT THE LIBERTIES OF THE PEOPLE WERE NO LONGER EXPOSED TO ANY PERIL FROM ROYAL AUTHORITY SO NARROWLY CIRCUMSCRIBED SO EXACTLY DEFINED
8226-274371-0018 MIGHT BE MAINTAINED UPON VERY PLAUSIBLE TOPICS BUT THAT THE DANGER ALLOWING IT TO HAVE ANY EXISTENCE WAS NOT OF THAT KIND GREAT URGENT INEVITABLE WHICH DISSOLVES ALL LAW AND LEVELS ALL LIMITATIONS
8226-274371-0019 WERE UNDOUBTEDLY NOT OF A CIVIL BUT OF A RELIGIOUS NATURE THE DISTEMPERED IMAGINATIONS OF MEN WERE AGITATED WITH A CONTINUAL DREAD OF POPERY WITH A HORROR AGAINST PRELACY WITH AN ANTIPATHY TO CEREMONIES AND THE LITURGY
8226-274371-0020 AND MORE ACTUATED BY PRINCIPLE
8226-274371-0021 NEVER WERE THERE INDIVIDUALS WHO POSSESSED MORE CAPACITY MORE COURAGE MORE PUBLIC SPIRIT MORE DISINTERESTED ZEAL THE INFUSION OF ONE INGREDIENT IN TOO LARGE A PROPORTION HAD CORRUPTED ALL THESE NOBLE PRINCIPLES
8226-274371-0022 AND CONVERTED THEM INTO THE MOST VIRULENT POISON TO DETERMINE HIS CHOICE IN THE APPROACHING CONTESTS EVERY MAN HEARKENED WITH AVIDITY TO THE REASONS PROPOSED ON BOTH SIDES THE WAR OF THE PEN PRECEDED THAT OF THE SWORD
8226-274371-0023 LORD FALKLAND HAD ACCEPTED THE OFFICE OF SECRETARY A MAN WHO ADORNED THE PUREST VIRTUE WITH THE RICHEST GIFTS OF NATURE AND THE MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITIONS OF LEARNING BY HIM ASSISTED BY THE KING HIMSELF
8226-274371-0024 WERE THE MEMORIALS OF THE ROYAL PARTY CHIEFLY COMPOSED SO SENSIBLE WAS CHARLES OF HIS SUPERIORITY IN THIS PARTICULAR THAT HE TOOK CARE TO DISPERSE EVERY WHERE THE PAPERS OF THE PARLIAMENT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN
8226-274371-0025 BY COMPARISON TO FORM A JUDGMENT BETWEEN THEM THE PARLIAMENT WHILE THEY DISTRIBUTED COPIES OF THEIR OWN WERE ANXIOUS TO SUPPRESS ALL THE KING'S COMPOSITIONS
8226-274371-0026 TO THE ORDINANCE OF THE PARLIAMENT CONCERNING THE MILITIA THE KING OPPOSED HIS COMMISSIONS OF ARRAY THE COUNTIES OBEYED THE ONE OR THE OTHER ACCORDING AS THEY STOOD AFFECTED AND IN MANY COUNTIES WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE DIVIDED
8226-274371-0027 MOBBISH COMBATS AND SKIRMISHES ENSUED THE PARLIAMENT ON THIS OCCASION WENT SO FAR AS TO VOTE THAT WHEN THE LORDS AND COMMONS IN PARLIAMENT WHICH IS THE SUPREME COURT OF JUDICATURE
8226-274371-0028 UPON THE SAME PRINCIPLES THEY PRETENDED BY A VERBAL CRITICISM ON THE TENSE OF A LATIN VERB TO RAVISH FROM THE KING HIS NEGATIVE VOICE IN THE LEGISLATURE
8226-274371-0029 WOULD ADMIT HIM WITH HIS RETINUE AFTER WHICH HE MIGHT EASILY RENDER HIMSELF MASTER OF THE PLACE BUT THE GOVERNOR WAS ON HIS GUARD HE SHUT THE GATES AND REFUSED TO RECEIVE THE KING
8226-274371-0030 WHO DESIRED LEAVE TO ENTER WITH TWENTY PERSONS ONLY CHARLES IMMEDIATELY PROCLAIMED HIM TRAITOR
8226-274371-0031 THOUGH THEY HAD ALREADY LEVIED A GUARD FOR THEMSELVES HAD ATTEMPTED TO SEIZE ALL THE MILITARY POWER ALL THE NAVY AND ALL THE FORTS OF THE KINGDOM AND HAD OPENLY EMPLOYED THEIR AUTHORITY IN EVERY KIND OF WARLIKE PREPARATIONS YET IMMEDIATELY VOTED
8226-274371-0032 THAT THE KING SEDUCED BY WICKED COUNSEL INTENDED TO MAKE WAR AGAINST HIS PARLIAMENT WHO IN ALL THEIR CONSULTATIONS AND ACTIONS HAD PROPOSED NO OTHER END BUT THE CARE OF HIS KINGDOMS
8226-274371-0033 WERE TRAITORS TO THE FUNDAMENTAL LAWS OF THE KINGDOM THE ARMIES WHICH HAD BEEN EVERYWHERE RAISED ON PRETENCE OF THE SERVICE IN IRELAND WERE HENCEFORTH MORE OPENLY ENLISTED BY THE PARLIAMENT FOR THEIR OWN PURPOSES
8226-274371-0034 AND THE COMMAND OF THEM WAS GIVEN TO THE EARL OF ESSEX IN LONDON NO LESS THAN FOUR THOUSAND MEN ENLISTED IN ONE DAY AND THE PARLIAMENT VOTED A DECLARATION WHICH THEY REQUIRED EVERY MEMBER TO SUBSCRIBE
8226-274371-0035 THEY ISSUED ORDERS FOR BRINGING IN LOANS OF MONEY AND PLATE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN FORCES WHICH SHOULD DEFEND THE KING AND BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT FOR THIS STYLE THEY STILL PRESERVED WITHIN TEN DAYS
8226-274371-0036 AND WAIT TILL THE TREASURERS COULD FIND LEISURE TO RECEIVE THEM SUCH ZEAL ANIMATED THE PIOUS PARTISANS OF THE PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0037 NEAR THE MOIETY TOO OF THE LOWER HOUSE ABSENTED THEMSELVES FROM COUNSELS WHICH THEY DEEMED SO FULL OF DANGER THE COMMONS SENT UP AN IMPEACHMENT AGAINST NINE PEERS FOR DESERTING THEIR DUTY IN PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0038 THEIR OWN MEMBERS ALSO WHO SHOULD RETURN TO THEM THEY VOTED NOT TO ADMIT TILL SATISFIED CONCERNING THE REASON OF THEIR ABSENCE CHARLES MADE A DECLARATION TO THE PEERS WHO ATTENDED HIM
8226-274371-0039 THAT HE EXPECTED FROM THEM NO OBEDIENCE TO ANY COMMANDS WHICH WERE NOT WARRANTED BY THE LAWS OF THE LAND THE PEERS ANSWERED THIS DECLARATION BY A PROTEST
8226-274371-0040 IN ORDER TO REMOVE ALL JEALOUSY HE HAD RESOLVED THAT THEIR USURPATIONS AND ILLEGAL PRETENSIONS SHOULD BE APPARENT TO THE WHOLE WORLD AND THOUGHT THAT TO RECOVER THE CONFIDENCE OF THE PEOPLE WAS A POINT MUCH MORE MATERIAL TO HIS INTEREST
8226-274371-0041 THAN THE COLLECTING OF ANY MAGAZINES STORES OR ARMIES WHICH MIGHT BREED APPREHENSIONS OF VIOLENT OR ILLEGAL COUNSELS BUT THE URGENT NECESSITY OF HIS SITUATION NO LONGER ADMITTED OF DELAY
8226-274371-0042 HE NOW PREPARED HIMSELF FOR DEFENCE WITH A SPIRIT ACTIVITY AND ADDRESS
8226-274371-0043 HE EMPLOYED ALL THE ADVANTAGES WHICH REMAINED TO HIM AND ROUSED UP HIS ADHERENTS TO ARMS THE RESOURCES OF THIS PRINCE'S GENIUS INCREASED IN PROPORTION TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
8226-274371-0044 AND HE NEVER APPEARED GREATER THAN WHEN PLUNGED INTO THE DEEPEST PERILS AND DISTRESSES FROM THE MIXED CHARACTER INDEED OF CHARLES AROSE IN PART THE MISFORTUNES IN WHICH ENGLAND WAS AT THIS TIME INVOLVED
8226-274371-0045 THAT THE KING MIGHT DESPAIR OF ALL COMPOSITION
8226-274371-0046 THEIR DEMANDS CONTAINED IN NINETEEN PROPOSITIONS AMOUNTED TO A TOTAL ABOLITION OF MONARCHICAL AUTHORITY THEY REQUIRED THAT NO MAN SHOULD REMAIN IN THE COUNCIL WHO WAS NOT AGREEABLE TO PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0047 THAT NONE OF THE ROYAL FAMILY SHOULD MARRY WITHOUT CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT OR COUNCIL
8226-274371-0048 THAT THE VOTES OF POPISH LORDS SHOULD BE EXCLUDED THAT THE REFORMATION OF THE LITURGY AND CHURCH GOVERNMENT SHOULD HAVE PLACE ACCORDING TO ADVICE OF PARLIAMENT THAT THE ORDINANCE WITH REGARD TO THE MILITIA BE SUBMITTED TO
8226-274371-0049 THAT THE JUSTICE OF PARLIAMENT PASS UPON ALL DELINQUENTS THAT A GENERAL PARDON BE GRANTED WITH SUCH EXCEPTIONS AS SHOULD BE ADVISED BY PARLIAMENT THAT THE FORTS AND CASTLES BE DISPOSED OF BY CONSENT OF PARLIAMENT
8226-274371-0050 AND THAT NO PEER BE MADE BUT WITH CONSENT OF BOTH HOUSES SHOULD I GRANT THESE DEMANDS SAID THE KING IN REPLY I MAY BE WAITED ON BAREHEADED I MAY HAVE MY HAND KISSED
8226-274371-0051 THE TITLE OF MAJESTY MAY BE CONTINUED TO ME AND THE KING'S AUTHORITY SIGNIFIED BY BOTH HOUSES MAY STILL BE THE STYLE OF YOUR COMMANDS I MAY HAVE SWORDS AND MACES CARRIED BEFORE ME
8226-274371-0052 BUT THE PICTURE BUT THE SIGN OF A KING WAR ON ANY TERMS WAS ESTEEMED BY THE KING AND ALL THE COUNSELLORS PREFERABLE TO SO IGNOMINIOUS A PEACE
8226-274371-0053 AND THE HEARTS OF HIS LOYAL SUBJECTS WHICH WITH GOD'S BLESSING HE DOUBTED NOT WOULD RECOVER ALL THE REST COLLECTING THEREFORE SOME FORCES HE ADVANCED SOUTHWARDS
8238-274553-0000 I'LL HAVE NONE O THEM NED KNOWLES THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG WAS A NOBLE HUNGARIAN FAMILY EVERY MEMBER OF WHICH AT LEAST AS FAR BACK INTO ANTIQUITY AS ANY CERTAIN RECORDS EXTEND
8238-274553-0001 WAS MORE OR LESS REMARKABLE FOR TALENT OF SOME DESCRIPTION THE MAJORITY FOR THAT SPECIES OF GROTESQUERIE IN CONCEPTION OF WHICH TIECK A SCION OF THE HOUSE HAS GIVEN A VIVID
8238-274553-0002 THREW A PLACE IN HIS REGARD AND HERE WITH SOMEWHAT MORE DIFFICULTY A PARTIAL INSIGHT INTO HIS MENTAL CONFORMATION IN LATER DAYS THIS INSIGHT GREW MORE CLEAR
8238-274553-0003 WHICH HIS ADVENT EXCITED WITHIN THE COLLEGE PRECINCTS ON THE NIGHT OF THE TWENTY FIFTH OF JUNE I REMEMBER STILL MORE DISTINCTLY THAT WHILE HE WAS PRONOUNCED BY ALL PARTIES AT FIRST SIGHT THE MOST REMARKABLE MAN IN THE WORLD
8238-274553-0004 NO PERSON MADE ANY ATTEMPT AT ACCOUNTING FOR HIS OPINION THAT HE WAS UNIQUE APPEARED SO UNDENIABLE THAT IT WAS DEEMED IMPERTINENT TO INQUIRE WHEREIN THE UNIQUITY CONSISTED
8238-274553-0005 BUT LETTING THIS MATTER PASS FOR THE PRESENT I WILL MERELY OBSERVE THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT OF HIS SETTING FOOT WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE UNIVERSITY HE BEGAN TO EXERCISE OVER THE HABITS
8238-274553-0006 MANNERS PERSONS PURSES AND PROPENSITIES OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY WHICH SURROUNDED HIM AN INFLUENCE THE MOST EXTENSIVE AND DESPOTIC YET AT THE SAME TIME THE MOST INDEFINITE AND ALTOGETHER UNACCOUNTABLE
8238-274553-0007 THAT VERY EXTRAORDINARY EPOCH FORMING THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG THEN OF NO PARTICULAR AGE BY WHICH I MEAN THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORM A GUESS RESPECTING HIS AGE BY ANY DATA PERSONALLY AFFORDED
8238-274553-0008 HE MIGHT HAVE BEEN FIFTEEN OR FIFTY
8238-274553-0009 HE WAS BY NO MEANS A HANDSOME MAN PERHAPS THE REVERSE THE CONTOUR OF HIS FACE WAS SOMEWHAT ANGULAR AND HARSH HIS FOREHEAD WAS LOFTY AND VERY FAIR HIS NOSE A SNUB
8238-274553-0010 AFTER SUCH A FASHION THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO CONCEIVE ANY EVEN THE MOST COMPLEX COMBINATION OF HUMAN FEATURES CONVEYING SO ENTIRELY AND SO SINGLY THE IDEA OF UNMITIGATED GRAVITY
8238-274553-0011 SOLEMNITY AND REPOSE IT WILL BE PERCEIVED NO DOUBT FROM WHAT I HAVE ALREADY SAID THAT THE BARON WAS ONE OF THOSE HUMAN ANOMALIES NOW AND THEN TO BE FOUND WHO MAKE THE SCIENCE OF MYSTIFICATION
8238-274553-0012 THE STUDY AND THE BUSINESS OF THEIR LIVES FOR THIS SCIENCE A PECULIAR TURN OF MIND GAVE HIM INSTINCTIVELY THE CUE
8238-274553-0013 I QUAINTLY TERMED THE DOMINATION OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG EVER RIGHTLY ENTERED INTO THE MYSTERY WHICH OVERSHADOWED HIS CHARACTER I TRULY THINK THAT NO PERSON AT THE UNIVERSITY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF
8238-274553-0014 EVER SUSPECTED HIM TO BE CAPABLE OF A JOKE VERBAL OR PRACTICAL THE OLD BULL DOG AT THE GARDEN GATE WOULD SOONER HAVE BEEN ACCUSED THE GHOST OF HERACLITUS OR THE WIG OF THE EMERITUS PROFESSOR OF THEOLOGY
8238-274553-0015 THIS TOO WHEN IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE MOST EGREGIOUS AND UNPARDONABLE OF ALL CONCEIVABLE TRICKS WHIMSICALITIES AND BUFFOONERIES WERE BROUGHT ABOUT IF NOT DIRECTLY BY HIM
8238-274553-0016 LAY IN THAT CONSUMMATE ABILITY RESULTING FROM AN ALMOST INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE OF HUMAN NATURE AND A MOST WONDERFUL SELF POSSESSION
8238-274553-0017 IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LAUDABLE EFFORTS HE WAS MAKING FOR THEIR PREVENTION AND FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE GOOD ORDER AND DIGNITY OF ALMA MATER
8238-274553-0018 WHICH UPON EACH SUCH FAILURE OF HIS PRAISE WORTHY ENDEAVORS WOULD SUFFUSE EVERY LINEAMENT OF HIS COUNTENANCE LEFT NOT THE SLIGHTEST ROOM FOR DOUBT OF HIS SINCERITY IN THE BOSOMS OF EVEN HIS MOST SKEPTICAL COMPANIONS
8238-274553-0019 THE ADROITNESS TOO WAS NO LESS WORTHY OF OBSERVATION BY WHICH HE CONTRIVED TO SHIFT THE SENSE OF THE GROTESQUE FROM THE CREATOR TO THE CREATED
8238-274553-0020 FROM HIS OWN PERSON TO THE ABSURDITIES TO WHICH HE HAD GIVEN RISE IN NO INSTANCE BEFORE THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK HAVE I KNOWN THE HABITUAL MYSTIFIC ESCAPE
8238-274553-0021 MY FRIEND APPEARED TO LIVE ONLY FOR THE SEVERITIES OF SOCIETY AND NOT EVEN HIS OWN HOUSEHOLD
8238-274553-0022 WITH THE MEMORY OF THE BARON RITZNER VON JUNG
8238-274553-0023 LAY LIKE AN INCUBUS UPON THE UNIVERSITY
8238-274553-0024 DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE NIGHT HAD RUN WILD UPON THE ALL ENGROSSING TOPIC OF THE TIMES THE BARON WHO HAD BEEN UNUSUALLY SILENT AND ABSTRACTED IN THE EARLIER PORTION OF THE EVENING
8238-274553-0025 AND DWELT UPON THE BENEFITS AND MORE ESPECIALLY UPON THE BEAUTIES OF THE RECEIVED CODE OF ETIQUETTE IN PASSAGES OF ARMS WITH AN ARDOR AN ELOQUENCE
8238-274553-0026 AN IMPRESSIVENESS AND AN AFFECTIONATENESS OF MANNER WHICH ELICITED THE WARMEST ENTHUSIASM FROM HIS HEARERS IN GENERAL AND ABSOLUTELY STAGGERED EVEN MYSELF WHO WELL KNEW HIM TO BE AT HEART
8238-274553-0027 A RIDICULER OF THOSE VERY POINTS FOR WHICH HE CONTENDED AND ESPECIALLY TO HOLD THE ENTIRE FANFARONADE OF DUELLING ETIQUETTE IN THE SOVEREIGN CONTEMPT WHICH IT DESERVES
8238-274553-0028 LOOKING AROUND ME DURING A PAUSE IN THE BARON'S DISCOURSE OF WHICH MY READERS MAY GATHER SOME FAINT IDEA WHEN I SAY THAT IT BORE RESEMBLANCE TO THE FERVID CHANTING MONOTONOUS YET MUSICAL SERMONIC MANNER OF COLERIDGE
8238-274553-0029 EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE SINGLE PARTICULAR THAT HE WAS A VERY GREAT FOOL HE CONTRIVED TO BEAR HOWEVER AMONG A PARTICULAR SET AT THE UNIVERSITY A REPUTATION FOR DEEP METAPHYSICAL THINKING
8238-274553-0030 AND I BELIEVE FOR SOME LOGICAL TALENT AS A DUELLIST HE HAD ACQUIRED WHO HAD FALLEN AT HIS HANDS BUT THEY WERE MANY HE WAS A MAN OF COURAGE UNDOUBTEDLY
8238-274553-0031 BUT IT WAS UPON HIS MINUTE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DUELLO AND THE NICETY OF HIS SENSE OF HONOR THAT HE MOST ESPECIALLY PRIDED HIMSELF THESE THINGS WERE A HOBBY WHICH HE RODE TO THE DEATH TO RITZNER
8238-274553-0032 EVER UPON THE LOOKOUT FOR THE GROTESQUE HIS PECULIARITIES HAD FOR A LONG TIME PAST AFFORDED FOOD FOR MYSTIFICATION OF THIS HOWEVER I WAS NOT AWARE
8238-274553-0033 I PERCEIVED THE EXCITEMENT OF THE LATTER MOMENTLY INCREASING AT LENGTH HE SPOKE OFFERING SOME OBJECTION TO A POINT INSISTED UPON BY R AND GIVING HIS REASONS IN DETAIL
8238-274553-0034 TO THESE THE BARON REPLIED AT LENGTH STILL MAINTAINING HIS EXAGGERATED TONE OF SENTIMENT AND CONCLUDING IN WHAT I THOUGHT VERY BAD TASTE WITH A SARCASM AND A SNEER
8238-274553-0035 YOUR OPINIONS ALLOW ME TO SAY BARON VON JUNG ALTHOUGH IN THE MAIN CORRECT ARE IN MANY NICE POINTS DISCREDITABLE TO YOURSELF AND TO THE UNIVERSITY OF WHICH YOU ARE A MEMBER
8238-274553-0036 I WOULD SAY SIR THAT YOUR OPINIONS ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN AS HERMANN COMPLETED THIS EQUIVOCAL SENTENCE ALL EYES WERE TURNED UPON THE BARON
8238-274553-0037 THEN EXCESSIVELY RED THEN DROPPING HIS POCKET HANDKERCHIEF STOOPED TO RECOVER IT WHEN I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF HIS COUNTENANCE WHILE IT COULD BE SEEN BY NO ONE ELSE AT THE TABLE
8238-274553-0038 IT WAS RADIANT WITH THE QUIZZICAL EXPRESSION WHICH WAS ITS NATURAL CHARACTER BUT WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN IT ASSUME EXCEPT WHEN WE WERE ALONE TOGETHER AND WHEN HE UNBENT HIMSELF FREELY IN AN INSTANT AFTERWARD HE STOOD ERECT
8238-274553-0039 FOR A MOMENT I EVEN FANCIED THAT I HAD MISCONCEIVED HIM AND THAT HE WAS IN SOBER EARNEST HE APPEARED TO BE STIFLING WITH PASSION AND HIS FACE WAS CADAVEROUSLY WHITE
8238-274553-0040 FOR A SHORT TIME HE REMAINED SILENT APPARENTLY STRIVING TO MASTER HIS EMOTION HAVING AT LENGTH SEEMINGLY SUCCEEDED HE REACHED A DECANTER WHICH STOOD NEAR HIM SAYING AS HE HELD IT FIRMLY CLENCHED
8238-274553-0041 THE LANGUAGE YOU HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO EMPLOY
8238-274553-0042 IN ADDRESSING YOURSELF TO ME IS OBJECTIONABLE IN SO MANY PARTICULARS THAT I HAVE NEITHER TEMPER NOR TIME FOR SPECIFICATION THAT MY OPINIONS HOWEVER ARE NOT THE OPINIONS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A GENTLEMAN
8238-274553-0043 IS AN OBSERVATION SO DIRECTLY OFFENSIVE AS TO ALLOW ME BUT ONE LINE OF CONDUCT
8238-274553-0044 YOU WILL FORGIVE ME FOR THE MODERATE TAX I SHALL MAKE UPON YOUR IMAGINATION AND ENDEAVOR TO CONSIDER FOR AN INSTANT
8238-274553-0045 THIS BEING DONE THERE WILL BE NO DIFFICULTY WHATEVER I SHALL DISCHARGE THIS DECANTER OF WINE AT YOUR IMAGE IN YONDER MIRROR AND THUS FULFIL ALL THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE EXACT LETTER OF RESENTMENT FOR YOUR INSULT
8238-274553-0046 WHILE THE NECESSITY OF PHYSICAL VIOLENCE TO YOUR REAL PERSON WILL BE OBVIATED WITH THESE WORDS HE HURLED THE DECANTER FULL OF WINE AGAINST THE MIRROR WHICH HUNG DIRECTLY OPPOSITE HERMANN
8238-274553-0047 STRIKING THE REFLECTION OF HIS PERSON WITH GREAT PRECISION AND OF COURSE SHATTERING THE GLASS INTO FRAGMENTS THE WHOLE COMPANY AT ONCE STARTED TO THEIR FEET AND WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MYSELF AND RITZNER TOOK THEIR DEPARTURE
8238-274553-0048 AS HERMANN WENT OUT THE BARON WHISPERED ME THAT I SHOULD FOLLOW HIM AND MAKE AN OFFER OF MY SERVICES TO THIS I AGREED NOT KNOWING PRECISELY WHAT TO MAKE OF SO RIDICULOUS A PIECE OF BUSINESS
8238-274553-0049 AND TAKING MY ARM LED ME TO HIS APARTMENT I COULD HARDLY FORBEAR LAUGHING IN HIS FACE WHILE HE PROCEEDED TO DISCUSS WITH THE PROFOUNDEST GRAVITY WHAT HE TERMED THE REFINEDLY PECULIAR CHARACTER
8238-274553-0050 AFTER A TIRESOME HARANGUE IN HIS ORDINARY STYLE HE TOOK DOWN FROM HIS BOOK SHELVES A NUMBER OF MUSTY VOLUMES ON THE SUBJECT OF THE DUELLO AND ENTERTAINED ME FOR A LONG TIME
8238-274553-0051 THE THEATRE OF HONOR BY FAVYN
8238-274553-0052 BRANTOME'S MEMOIRS OF DUELS PUBLISHED AT COLOGNE SIXTEEN SIXTY SIX
8238-274553-0053 WITH A FINE MARGIN AND BOUND BY DEROME
8238-274553-0054 AND HAVING THE QUAINT TITLE DUELLI LEX SCRIPTA ET NON
8238-274553-0055 FROM THIS HE READ ME ONE OF THE DROLLEST CHAPTERS IN THE WORLD
8238-274553-0056 PER CONSTRUCTIONEM
8238-274553-0057 ALTHOUGH NOT ONE SYLLABLE OF THE WHOLE MATTER COULD I UNDERSTAND FOR THE LIFE OF ME HAVING FINISHED THE CHAPTER HE CLOSED THE BOOK AND DEMANDED WHAT I THOUGHT NECESSARY TO BE DONE I REPLIED THAT I HAD ENTIRE CONFIDENCE IN HIS SUPERIOR DELICACY OF FEELING
8238-274553-0058 WILL HAND YOU THIS NOTE I FIND IT INCUMBENT UPON ME TO REQUEST AT YOUR EARLIEST CONVENIENCE AN EXPLANATION OF THIS EVENING'S OCCURRENCES AT YOUR CHAMBERS IN THE EVENT OF YOUR DECLINING THIS REQUEST
8238-274553-0059 HAVING PERUSED THE CARTEL HE WROTE THE FOLLOWING REPLY WHICH I CARRIED TO HERMANN SIR THROUGH OUR COMMON FRIEND MISTER P I HAVE RECEIVED YOUR NOTE OF THIS EVENING
8238-274553-0060 UPON DUE REFLECTION I FRANKLY ADMIT THE PROPRIETY OF THE EXPLANATION YOU SUGGEST THIS BEING ADMITTED I STILL FIND GREAT DIFFICULTY OWING TO THE REFINEDLY PECULIAR NATURE OF OUR DISAGREEMENT
8238-274553-0061 I HAVE GREAT RELIANCE HOWEVER ON THAT EXTREME DELICACY OF DISCRIMINATION IN MATTERS APPERTAINING TO THE RULES OF ETIQUETTE
8238-274553-0062 THE NICETY OF YOUR DISCERNMENT IN ALL THE MATTERS HERE TREATED WILL BE SUFFICIENT I AM ASSURED
8238-274553-0063 TO CONVINCE YOU THAT THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF ME REFERRING YOU TO THIS ADMIRABLE PASSAGE OUGHT TO SATISFY YOUR REQUEST AS A MAN OF HONOR FOR EXPLANATION WITH SENTIMENTS OF PROFOUND RESPECT YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT VON JUNG
8238-274553-0064 HERMANN COMMENCED THE PERUSAL OF THIS EPISTLE WITH A SCOWL WHICH HOWEVER WAS CONVERTED INTO A SMILE OF THE MOST LUDICROUS SELF COMPLACENCY
8238-274553-0065 ET PER SE HAVING FINISHED READING HE BEGGED ME WITH THE BLANDEST OF ALL POSSIBLE SMILES TO BE SEATED WHILE HE MADE REFERENCE TO THE TREATISE IN QUESTION TURNING TO THE PASSAGE SPECIFIED HE READ IT WITH GREAT CARE TO HIMSELF
8238-274553-0066 TO ASSURE HIM THAT THE EXPLANATION OFFERED WAS OF THE FULLEST THE MOST HONORABLE AND THE MOST UNEQUIVOCALLY SATISFACTORY NATURE SOMEWHAT AMAZED AT ALL THIS I MADE MY RETREAT TO THE BARON
8238-274553-0067 HE SEEMED TO RECEIVE HERMANN'S AMICABLE LETTER AS A MATTER OF COURSE AND AFTER A FEW WORDS OF GENERAL CONVERSATION WENT TO AN INNER ROOM AND BROUGHT OUT THE EVERLASTING TREATISE DUELLI LEX SCRIPTA ET NON
8238-274553-0068 HE HANDED ME THE VOLUME AND ASKED ME TO LOOK OVER SOME PORTION OF IT I DID SO BUT TO LITTLE PURPOSE NOT BEING ABLE TO GATHER THE LEAST PARTICLE OF MEANING HE THEN TOOK THE BOOK HIMSELF AND READ ME A CHAPTER ALOUD TO MY SURPRISE
8238-274553-0069 HE NOW EXPLAINED THE MYSTERY
8238-274553-0070 AND EVEN OF PROFUNDITY WHILE IN FACT NOT A SHADOW OF MEANING EXISTED THE KEY TO THE WHOLE WAS FOUND IN LEAVING OUT EVERY SECOND AND THIRD WORD ALTERNATELY
8238-274553-0071 WHEN THERE APPEARED A SERIES OF LUDICROUS QUIZZES UPON A SINGLE COMBAT AS PRACTISED IN MODERN TIMES THE BARON AFTERWARDS INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD PURPOSELY THROWN THE TREATISE IN HERMANN'S WAY
8238-274553-0072 TWO OR THREE WEEKS BEFORE THE ADVENTURE AND THAT HE WAS SATISFIED FROM THE GENERAL TENOR OF HIS CONVERSATION
8238-274553-0073 AND FIRMLY BELIEVED IT TO BE A WORK OF UNUSUAL MERIT UPON THIS HINT HE PROCEEDED
8238-274553-0074 HERMANN WOULD HAVE DIED A THOUSAND DEATHS RATHER THAN ACKNOWLEDGE HIS INABILITY TO UNDERSTAND ANYTHING AND EVERYTHING IN THE UNIVERSE THAT HAD EVER BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THE DUELLO
8238-283452-0000 INTRODUCTION THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS DISTINCTLY A MODERN CHARACTER IN EARLY LITERATURE WRAITHS TOOK THEMSELVES VERY SERIOUSLY
8238-283452-0001 AND INSISTED ON A PROPER SHOW OF RESPECTFUL FEAR ON THE PART OF THOSE WHOM THEY HONORED BY HAUNTING A MORTAL WAS EXPECTED TO RISE WHEN A GHOST ENTERED THE ROOM AND IN CASE HE WAS SLOW ABOUT IT
8238-283452-0002 HIS SPINE GAVE NOTICE OF WHAT ETIQUETTE DEMANDED IN THE EVENT OF OUTDOOR APPARITION IF A MAN FAILED TO BARE HIS HEAD IN AWE THE ROOTS OF HIS HAIR REMINDED HIM OF HIS REMISSNESS
8238-283452-0003 IN THAT HER LOCKS BEING LONG AND PINNED UP ARE LESS EASILY MOVED WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THE FACT IF IT BE A FACT THAT IN FICTION WOMEN HAVE SHOWN THEMSELVES MORE SELF POSSESSED
8238-283452-0004 WHILE THE FEMININE CAN BE SEEN THROUGH BY ANOTHER WOMAN AND THUS DISARMED THE MAJORITY OF THE COMIC APPARITIONS CURIOUSLY ENOUGH ARE MASCULINE YOU DON'T OFTEN FIND WOMEN WRAITHED IN SMILES
8238-283452-0005 AND HAVE CHIVALROUSLY SPARED THE GENTLER SHADES AND THERE ARE VERY FEW FUNNY CHILD GHOSTS YOU MIGHT ALMOST SAY NONE IN COMPARISON WITH THE NUMBER OF GROWN UPS
8238-283452-0006 THE NUMBER OF GHOST CHILDREN OF ANY OR ALL TYPES IS SMALL PROPORTIONATELY PERHAPS BECAUSE IT SEEMS AN UNNATURAL THING FOR A CHILD TO DIE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES
8238-283452-0007 THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES AS IN THE CASE OF THE GHOST BABY MENTIONED LATER BUT VERY FEW ANCIENT GHOSTS WERE A LONG FACED LOT
8238-283452-0008 SINCE ANY LIVING PERSON HOWEVER SENILE WOULD BE THOUGHT JUVENILE COMPARED WITH A TIMELESS SPOOK BUT IN THESE DAYS OF INDIVIDUALISM AND RADICAL LIBERALISM SPOOKS AS WELL AS MORTALS ARE EXPANDING THEIR PERSONALITIES
8238-283452-0009 AND INDULGING IN GREATER FREEDOM A GHOST CAN CALL HIS SHADE HIS OWN NOW AND EXHIBIT ANY MOOD HE PLEASES EVEN YOUNG FEMALE WRAITHS DEMANDING LATCHKEYS REFUSE TO OBEY THE FROWNING FACE OF THE CLOCK
8238-283452-0010 TO MAKE THE GHOST OF MISSUS GRUNDY TURN A SHADE PALER IN HORROR NOWADAYS HAUNTERS HAVE MORE FUN AND FREEDOM THAN THE HAUNTED IN FACT IT'S MONEY IN ONE'S POCKET THESE DAYS TO BE DEAD FOR GHOSTS HAVE NO RENT PROBLEMS
8238-283452-0011 MANIFESTLY DEATH HAS COMPENSATIONS NOT CONNECTED WITH THE CONSOLATIONS OF RELIGION THE MARVEL IS THAT APPARITIONS WERE SO LONG IN REALIZING THEIR POSSIBILITIES IN IMPROVING THEIR ADVANTAGES
8238-283452-0012 THE SPECTERS IN CLASSIC AND MEDIEVAL LITERATURE WERE MALARIAL VAPOROUS BEINGS WITHOUT ENERGY TO DO ANYTHING BUT THREATEN
8238-283452-0013 AT BEST A REVENANT COULD ONLY RATTLE A RUSTY SKELETON OR SHAKE A MOLDY SHROUD OR CLANK A CHAIN BUT AS MORTALS COWERED BEFORE HIS DEMONSTRATIONS HE DIDN'T WORRY
8238-283452-0014 THE UP TO DATE GHOST KEEPS HIS SKELETON IN A GARAGE OR SOME PLACE WHERE IT IS CLEANED AND OILED AND KEPT IN GOOD WORKING ORDER THE MODERN WRAITH HAS SOLD HIS SHEET TO THE OLD CLO'ES MAN AND DRESSES AS IN LIFE
8238-283452-0015 HE KNOWS THAT THERE'S NO WEAPON NO THREAT IN HORROR TO BE COMPARED WITH RIDICULE THINK WHAT A SOLEMN CREATURE THE GOTHIC GHOST WAS
8238-283452-0016 HOW LITTLE ORIGINALITY AND INITIATIVE HE SHOWED AND HOW DEPENDENT HE WAS ON HIS OWN ATMOSPHERE FOR THRILLS HIS SOLE APPEAL WAS TO THE SPINAL COLUMN THE GHOST OF TO DAY TOUCHES THE FUNNY BONE AS WELL
8238-283452-0017 MANY AMERICANS THERE ARE TO DAY WHO WOULD COURT BEING HAUNTED BY THE CAPTAIN AND CREW OF RICHARD MIDDLETON'S GHOST SHIP THAT LANDED IN A TURNIP FIELD AND DISPENSED DRINK TILL THEY DEMORALIZED THE DENIZENS OF VILLAGE AND GRAVEYARD ALIKE
8238-283452-0018 AFTER THAT SHOW OF SPIRITS THE TURNIPS IN THAT FIELD TASTED OF RUM LONG AFTER THE GHOST SHIP HAD SAILED AWAY INTO THE BLUE THE MODERN SPOOK IS POSSESSED NOT ONLY OF HUMOR BUT OF A CAUSTIC SATIRE AS WELL
8238-283452-0019 HIS JEST IS LIKELY TO HAVE MORE THAN ONE POINT TO IT AND HE CAN HAUNT SO INSIDIOUSLY CAN MAKE HIMSELF SO AT HOME IN HIS HOST'S STUDY OR BEDROOM THAT A MAN ACTUALLY WELCOMES A CHAT WITH HIM
8238-283452-0020 A GHOST MOREOVER THAT TOWERED AND SWELLED AT EVERY HACKNEYED PHRASE TILL FINALLY HE FILLED THE ROOM AND BURST AFTER THE YOUNG MAN PROPOSED TO HIS ADMIRED ONE AND MADE SUBSEQUENT REMARKS
8238-283452-0021 GHOSTS NOT ONLY HAVE APPALLINGLY LONG MEMORIES BUT THEY POSSESS A MEAN ADVANTAGE OVER THE LIVING IN THAT THEY HAVE ONCE BEEN MORTAL
8238-283452-0022 THE MODERN HUMOROUS GHOST SATIRIZES EVERYTHING FROM THE OLD FASHIONED SPECTER HE'S VERY FOND OF TAKING POT SHOTS AT HIM TO THE LATEST PSYCHIC MANIFESTATIONS
8238-283452-0023 HE LAUGHS AT GHOSTS THAT AREN'T EXPERTS IN EFFICIENCY HAUNTING AND HE HAS A LOT OF FUN OUT OF MORTALS FOR BEING SCARED OF SPECTERS HE LOVES TO SHAKE THE LUGUBRIOUS TERRORS OF THE PAST BEFORE YOU
8238-283452-0024 AND USES THE OLD THRILLS ONLY TO SHOW WHAT DEAD BATTERIES THEY COME FROM HIS REALLY ELECTRICAL EFFECTS ARE HIS OWN INVENTIONS HE NEEDS NO DUNGEON KEEPS AND MONKISH CELLS TO PLAY ABOUT IN NOT HE
8238-283452-0025 HE DEMANDS NO RAG NOR BONE NOR CLANK OF CHAIN OF HIS OLD EQUIPMENT TO START ON HIS CAREER HE CAN START UP A MOVING PICTURE SHOW OF HIS OWN AS IN RUTH MC ENERY STUART'S THE HAUNTED PHOTOGRAPH
8238-283452-0026 AND DEMONSTRATE A NEW KIND OF APPARITION THE GHOST STORY OF TO DAY GIVES YOU SPINAL SENSATIONS WITH A DIFFERENCE AS IN THE IMMORTAL TRANSFERRED GHOST BY FRANK R STOCKTON
8238-283452-0027 WHERE THE SUITOR ON THE MOONLIT PORCH ATTEMPTING TO TELL HIS FAIR ONE THAT HE DOTES ON HER SEES THE GHOST OF HER FEROCIOUS UNCLE WHO ISN'T DEAD
8238-283452-0028 KICKING HIS HEELS AGAINST THE RAILING AND HEARS HIS ADMONITION THAT HE'D BETTER HURRY UP AS THE LIVE UNCLE IS COMING IN SIGHT
8238-283452-0029 HAS NEVER BEEN A GHOST NOR USED A WOODEN LEG BUT A TERRIFYING LEG ACY WHILE YOU DO BELIEVE IN IT THE NEW GHOST HAS A MORE NIMBLE AND VERSATILE TONGUE AS WELL AS WIT
8238-283452-0030 IN THE OLDER FICTION AND DRAMA APPARITIONS SPOKE SELDOM
8238-283452-0031 AND GHOSTS LIKE KINGS IN DRAMA WERE OF A DIGNITY AND MUST PRESERVE IT IN THEIR SPEECH OR PERHAPS THE AUTHORS WERE DOUBTFUL AS TO THE DIALOGUE OF SHADES
8238-283452-0032 AND COMPROMISED ON A FEW STATELY EJACULATIONS AS BEING SAFELY PHANTASMAL SPEAKING PARTS BUT COMPARE THAT USAGE WITH THE RUDE FREEDOM OF SOME MODERN SPOOKS
8238-283452-0033 THINK OF HAVING ALWAYS AND ALWAYS TO SPEAK A DEAD LANGUAGE THE HUMOROUS GHOST IS NOT ONLY MODERN BUT HE IS DISTINCTIVELY AMERICAN THERE ARE GHOSTS OF ALL NATIONALITIES NATURALLY
8238-283452-0034 BUT THE SPOOK THAT PROVIDES A JOKE ON HIS HOST OR ON HIMSELF IS YANKEE IN ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT THE DRY HUMOR THE COMIC SENSE OF THE INCONGRUOUS THE WILLINGNESS TO LAUGH AT HIMSELF AS AT OTHERS
8238-283452-0035 AND ARE PRESERVED IN THEIR TRUE FLAVOR I DON'T ASSERT OF COURSE
8238-283452-0036 THE FRENCH AND ENGLISH SELECTIONS IN THIS VOLUME ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THE CONTRARY
8238-283452-0037 THERE ARE VARIOUS ENGLISH STORIES OF WHIMSICAL HAUNTING SOME OF ACTUAL SPOOKS AND SOME OF THE HOAX TYPE HOAX GHOSTS ARE FAIRLY NUMEROUS IN BRITISH AS IN AMERICAN LITERATURE
8238-283452-0038 OF THE EARLY SPECIMENS OF THE REALLY AMUSING GHOST THAT IS AN ACTUAL REVENANT IS THE GHOST BABY IN BLACKWOOD'S WHICH SHOWS ORIGINALITY AND HUMOR YET IS TOO DIFFUSE FOR PRINTING HERE
8238-283452-0039 IN THAT WE HAVE A CONVENTIONAL YOUNG BACHELOR ENGAGED TO A CHARMING GIRL WHO IS ENTANGLED IN SOCIAL COMPLICATIONS AND MADE TO SUFFER MENTAL TORMENT BECAUSE WITHOUT HIS CONSENT
8238-283452-0040 TILL THE PHANTOM COUPLE TAKE A LIKING TO EACH OTHER AND DECIDE TO LET THE LIVING BURY THEIR DEAD THIS IS SUGGESTIVE OF BRANDER MATTHEWS'S EARLIER AND CLEVERER STORY OF A SPECTRAL COURTSHIP IN THE RIVAL GHOSTS
8238-283452-0041 MEDIEVAL AND LATER LITERATURE GAVE US MANY INSTANCES OF A LOVE AFFAIR OR MARRIAGE BETWEEN ONE SPIRIT AND ONE MORTAL
8238-283452-0042 SHOW THE DIVERSITY OF THE ENGLISH HUMOR AS ASSOCIATED WITH APPARITIONS AND ARE ENTERTAINING IN THEMSELVES THE CANTERVILLE GHOST BY OSCAR WILDE IS ONE OF HIS BEST SHORT STORIES
8238-283452-0043 THIS TRAVESTY ON THE CONVENTIONAL TRADITIONS OF THE WRAITH IS PREPOSTEROUSLY DELIGHTFUL ONE OF THE CLEVEREST GHOST STORIES IN OUR LANGUAGE ZANGWILL HAS WRITTEN ENGAGINGLY OF SPOOKS
8238-283452-0044 FRANK R STOCKTON GAVE HIS TO FUNNY SPOOKS WITH A RIOTOUS AND LAUGHING PEN THE SPIRIT IN HIS TRANSFERRED GHOST IS IMPUDENTLY DEATHLESS AND HAS CALLED UP A TRAIN OF SUBSEQUENT HAUNTERS
8238-283452-0045 JOHN KENDRICK BANGS HAS MADE THE DARKER REGIONS SEEM COMFORTABLE AND HOMELIKE FOR US AND HAS CREATED GHOSTS SO HUMAN AND SO FUNNY THAT WE LOOK FORWARD TO BEING ONE OR MORE
8238-283452-0046 WE FEEL DOWNRIGHT NEIGHBORLY TOWARD SUCH SPECTERS AS THE FUTILE LAST GHOST NELSON LLOYD EVOKES FOR US AS WE APPRECIATE THE SATIRE OF ROSE O'NEILL'S SOPHISTICATED WRAITH
8238-283452-0047 THE FIELD IS STILL COMPARATIVELY LIMITED BUT A NUMBER OF AMERICANS HAVE DONE DISTINCTIVE WORK IN IT THE SPECTER NOW WEARS MOTLEY INSTEAD OF A SHROUD
83-11691-0000 THIS IS A PAINFUL CHAPTER FOR ME TO WRITE MERCIFULLY IT IS TO BE A SHORT ONE LATER ON I SHALL BECOME USED TO THE SITUATION INCLINED EVEN TO DWELL UPON ITS HUMOROUS SIDE
83-11691-0001 BUT FOR THE MOMENT I CANNOT SEE BEYOND THE SADNESS OF IT THAT TO A PRINCE OF THE ROYAL HOUSE OF ARABY
83-11691-0002 ROGER SCURVILEGS FRANKLY BREAKS DOWN OVER IT THAT ABOMINABLE WOMAN HE SAYS MEANING OF COURSE BELVANE AND HE HAS HYSTERICS FOR MORE THAN A PAGE LET US DESCRIBE IT CALMLY
83-11691-0003 CORONEL CAME BACK FROM HIS STROLL IN THE SAME CASUAL WAY IN WHICH HE HAD STARTED
83-11691-0004 HE WAS NOT THINKING OF UDO HE WAS WONDERING IF PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD AN ATTENDANT OF SURPASSING BEAUTY OR A DRAGON OF SURPASSING MALEVOLENCE IF IN FACT
83-11691-0005 THERE WERE ANY ADVENTURES IN EURALIA FOR A HUMBLE FELLOW LIKE HIMSELF CORONEL SAID A SMALL VOICE BEHIND HIM HE TURNED ROUND INDIFFERENTLY
83-11691-0006 HE SAID ISN'T IT TIME WE WERE STARTING WE AREN'T STARTING SAID THE VOICE WHAT'S THE MATTER WHAT ARE YOU HIDING IN THE BUSHES FOR WHATEVER'S THE MATTER UDO
83-11691-0007 CORONEL STOPPED YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS'S COMMANDS HE BEGAN RATHER COLDLY THERE WAS AN OMINOUS SNIFFING FROM THE BUSHES CORONEL SAID AN UNHAPPY VOICE AT LAST
83-11691-0008 I THINK I'M COMING OUT WONDERING WHAT IT ALL MEANT CORONEL WAITED IN SILENCE YES I AM COMING OUT CORONEL SAID THE VOICE BUT YOU MUSTN'T BE SURPRISED IF I DON'T LOOK VERY WELL
83-11691-0009 I'M I'M CORONEL HERE I AM SAID UDO PATHETICALLY
83-11691-0010 IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT HE WAS SAVE THAT THERE WAS AN IMPRESSION OF MAGNIFICENCE ABOUT HIS PERSON SUCH MAGNIFICENCE ANYHOW AS IS GIVEN BY AN ASTRAKHAN TRIMMED FUR COAT
83-11691-0011 CORONEL DECIDED THAT IT WAS AN OCCASION FOR TACT AH HERE YOU ARE HE SAID CHEERFULLY SHALL WE GET ALONG DON'T BE A FOOL CORONEL SAID UDO ALMOST CRYING
83-11691-0012 WELL THINK OF THAT UDO SHOWED WHAT HE THOUGHT OF IT BY WAVING IT PEEVISHLY THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR TACT HE SAID TELL ME WHAT I LOOK LIKE CORONEL CONSIDERED FOR A MOMENT
83-11691-0013 REALLY FRANKLY HE ASKED
83-11691-0014 SAID UDO NERVOUSLY THEN FRANKLY YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS LOOKS FUNNY VERY FUNNY SAID UDO WISTFULLY VERY FUNNY SAID CORONEL HIS HIGHNESS SIGHED
83-11691-0015 I WAS AFRAID SO HE SAID THAT'S THE CRUEL PART ABOUT IT HAD I BEEN A LION THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A CERTAIN PATHETIC SPLENDOUR ABOUT MY POSITION ISOLATED CUT OFF SUFFERING IN REGAL SILENCE
83-11691-0016 HE WAVED AN EXPLANATORY PAW EVEN IN THE MOST HIDEOUS OF BEASTS THERE MIGHT BE A DIGNITY HE MEDITATED FOR A MOMENT HAVE YOU EVER SEEN A YAK CORONEL HE ASKED NEVER
83-11691-0017 I SAW ONE ONCE IN BARODIA IT IS NOT A BEAUTIFUL ANIMAL CORONEL BUT AS A YAK I SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY UNLOVABLE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH AT A YAK CORONEL
83-11691-0018 AND WHERE ONE DOES NOT LAUGH ONE MAY COME TO LOVE
83-11691-0019 STRIKING I HAVEN'T SEEN IT YOU SEE TO ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
83-11691-0020 RABBIT HE SOBBED SO UNDIGNIFIED
83-11691-0021 HE ADDED BITTERLY HOW DID IT HAPPEN I DON'T KNOW CORONEL I JUST WENT TO SLEEP
83-11691-0022 HE SAT UP SUDDENLY AND STARED AT CORONEL IT WAS THAT OLD WOMAN DID IT YOU MARK MY WORDS CORONEL SHE DID IT WHY SHOULD SHE
83-11691-0023 I WAS VERY POLITE TO HER DON'T YOU REMEMBER MY SAYING TO YOU BE POLITE TO HER BECAUSE SHE'S PROBABLY A FAIRY
83-11691-0024 SO THEY HELD A COUNCIL OF WAR PRINCE UDO PUT FORWARD TWO SUGGESTIONS THE FIRST WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK ON THE MORROW AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN THE SECOND
83-11691-0025 WAS THAT CORONEL SHOULD GO BACK THAT AFTERNOON AND KILL THE OLD WOMAN CORONEL POINTED OUT THAT AS SHE HAD TURNED PRINCE UDO INTO INTO A A QUITE SO SAID UDO
83-11691-0026 IT WAS LIKELY THAT SHE ALONE COULD TURN HIM BACK AGAIN AND THAT IN THAT CASE HE HAD BETTER ONLY THREATEN HER I WANT SOMEBODY KILLED SAID UDO RATHER NATURALLY SUPPOSE SAID CORONEL
83-11691-0027 AND MAKE HER TELL ME WHAT SHE KNOWS SHE KNOWS SOMETHING I'M CERTAIN THEN WE SHALL SEE BETTER WHAT TO DO UDO MUSED FOR A SPACE WHY DIDN'T THEY TURN YOU INTO ANYTHING HE ASKED
83-11691-0028 REALLY I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS BECAUSE I'M TOO UNIMPORTANT YES THAT MUST BE IT HE BEGAN TO FEEL A LITTLE BRIGHTER OBVIOUSLY THAT'S IT HE CARESSED A WHISKER WITH ONE OF HIS PAWS
83-11691-0029 THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME HE BEGAN TO LOOK SO MUCH HAPPIER THAT CORONEL THOUGHT IT WAS A FAVOURABLE MOMENT IN WHICH TO WITHDRAW SHALL I GO NOW YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
83-11691-0030 HE MURMURED TO HIMSELF OBVIOUSLY
83-11691-0031 GOOD BYE YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS
83-11691-0032 CORONEL GOT ON HIS HORSE AND RODE AWAY AS SOON AS HE WAS OUT OF EARSHOT HE BEGAN TO LAUGH SPASM AFTER SPASM SHOOK HIM NO SOONER HAD HE COMPOSED HIMSELF TO GRAVITY
83-11691-0033 THAN A REMEMBRANCE OF UDO'S APPEARANCE STARTED HIM OFF AGAIN I COULDN'T HAVE STAYED WITH HIM A MOMENT LONGER HE THOUGHT I SHOULD HAVE BURST
83-11691-0034 HOWEVER WE'LL SOON GET HIM ALL RIGHT THAT EVENING HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE COTTAGE HAD STOOD BUT IT WAS GONE NEXT MORNING HE RODE BACK TO THE WOOD UDO WAS GONE TOO
83-11691-0035 HE RETURNED TO THE PALACE AND BEGAN TO THINK IT OUT LEFT TO HIMSELF UDO VERY SOON MADE UP HIS MIND THERE WERE THREE COURSES OPEN TO HIM HE MIGHT STAY WHERE HE WAS TILL HE WAS RESTORED TO HEALTH
83-11691-0036 THIS HE REJECTED AT ONCE WHEN YOU HAVE THE HEAD OF A RABBIT THE TAIL OF A LION AND THE MIDDLE OF A WOOLLY LAMB THE NEED FOR ACTION OF SOME KIND IS IMPERATIVE
83-11691-0037 HE MIGHT GO BACK TO ARABY
83-11691-0038 SO POPULAR TO ARABY WHERE HE RODE DAILY AMONG HIS FATHER'S SUBJECTS THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF CHEERING HIM HOW AWKWARD FOR EVERYBODY ON TO EURALIA THEN
83-11691-0039 WHY NOT THE PRINCESS HYACINTH HAD CALLED FOR HIM WHAT DEVOTION IT SHOWED IF HE CAME TO HER EVEN NOW IN HIS PRESENT STATE OF BAD HEALTH SHE WAS IN TROUBLE
83-11691-0040 ALREADY THEN HE HAD SUFFERED IN HER SERVICE SO AT LEAST HE WOULD SAY AND SO POSSIBLY IT MIGHT BE CORONEL HAD THOUGHT HIM FUNNY BUT WOMEN HAD NOT MUCH SENSE OF HUMOUR AS A RULE
83-11691-0041 SHE WOULD FIND HIM STROKABLE AND THE LION IN HIM
83-11691-0042 SHE WOULD FIND THAT INSPIRING
83-11691-0043 UNTAMABLE IN THE MAN THEY LOVE WELL THERE IT WAS IT WAS NOT AS IF HE HAD CORONEL WITH HIM CORONEL AND HE IN HIS PRESENT HEALTH COULD NEVER HAVE GONE INTO EURALIA TOGETHER
83-11691-0044 THE CONTRAST WAS TOO STRIKING BUT HE ALONE HYACINTH'S ONLY HELP SURELY SHE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS MAGNANIMITY ALSO AS HE HAD TOLD HIMSELF A MOMENT AGO
83-11691-0045 BUT NO DOUBT HE WOULD THINK OF SOME TREMENDOUSLY CUNNING DEVICE LATER ON TO EURALIA THEN WITH ALL DISPATCH HE TROTTED OFF
83-3054-0000 A WOMAN'S LIFE SAVED THE CAUSE OF HER FALLING INTO THE SEA
83-3054-0001 I OMITTED SEVERAL VERY MATERIAL PARTS IN MY FATHER'S JOURNEY ACROSS THE ENGLISH CHANNEL TO HOLLAND WHICH THAT THEY MAY NOT BE TOTALLY LOST
83-3054-0002 I WILL NOW FAITHFULLY GIVE YOU IN HIS OWN WORDS AS I HEARD HIM RELATE THEM TO HIS FRIENDS SEVERAL TIMES ON MY ARRIVAL SAYS MY FATHER AT HELVOETSLUYS I WAS OBSERVED TO BREATHE WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
83-3054-0003 CARRYING THEIR HEADS AT THE EXTREMITY OF THEIR TAILS I CROSSED CONTINUED HE ONE PRODIGIOUS RANGE OF ROCKS EQUAL IN HEIGHT TO THE ALPS THE TOPS OR HIGHEST PARTS OF THESE MARINE MOUNTAINS
83-3054-0004 ARE SAID TO BE UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED FATHOMS BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA ON THE SIDES OF WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT VARIETY OF TALL NOBLE TREES LOADED WITH MARINE FRUIT SUCH AS LOBSTERS CRABS OYSTERS SCOLLOPS
83-3054-0005 FRUIT SHOOK OFF THE BRANCHES OF THE TREE IT GROWS UPON BY THE MOTION OF THE WATER AS THOSE IN OUR GARDENS ARE BY THAT OF THE WIND THE LOBSTER TREES APPEARED THE RICHEST BUT THE CRAB AND OYSTERS WERE THE TALLEST
83-3054-0006 THE PERIWINKLE IS A KIND OF SHRUB IT GROWS AT THE FOOT OF THE OYSTER TREE AND TWINES ROUND IT AS THE IVY DOES THE OAK
83-3054-0007 AS SHE SANK SHE FELL UPON HER SIDE AND FORCED A VERY LARGE LOBSTER TREE OUT OF ITS PLACE IT WAS IN THE SPRING WHEN THE LOBSTERS WERE VERY YOUNG
83-3054-0008 AND MANY OF THEM BEING SEPARATED BY THE VIOLENCE OF THE SHOCK THEY FELL UPON A CRAB TREE WHICH WAS GROWING BELOW THEM THEY HAVE LIKE THE FARINA OF PLANTS UNITED AND PRODUCED A FISH RESEMBLING BOTH
83-3054-0009 I ENDEAVOURED TO BRING ONE WITH ME BUT IT WAS TOO CUMBERSOME AND MY SALT WATER PEGASUS SEEMED MUCH DISPLEASED AT EVERY ATTEMPT TO STOP HIS CAREER WHILST I CONTINUED UPON HIS BACK
83-3054-0010 BESIDES I WAS THEN THOUGH GALLOPING OVER A MOUNTAIN OF ROCKS THAT LAY ABOUT MIDWAY THE PASSAGE AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED FATHOM BELOW THE SURFACE OF THE SEA AND BEGAN TO FIND THE WANT OF AIR INCONVENIENT
83-3054-0011 THEREFORE I HAD NO INCLINATION TO PROLONG THE TIME ADD TO THIS MY SITUATION WAS IN OTHER RESPECTS VERY UNPLEASANT I MET MANY LARGE FISH WHO WERE IF I COULD JUDGE BY THEIR OPEN MOUTHS
83-3054-0012 NOT ONLY ABLE BUT REALLY WISHED TO DEVOUR US NOW AS MY ROSINANTE WAS BLIND I HAD THESE HUNGRY GENTLEMEN'S ATTEMPTS TO GUARD AGAINST IN ADDITION TO MY OTHER DIFFICULTIES
83-3054-0013 AS WE DREW NEAR THE DUTCH SHORE AND THE BODY OF WATER OVER OUR HEADS DID NOT EXCEED TWENTY FATHOMS I THOUGHT I SAW A HUMAN FIGURE IN A FEMALE DRESS THEN LYING ON THE SAND BEFORE ME WITH SOME SIGNS OF LIFE
83-3054-0014 WHEN I CAME CLOSE I PERCEIVED HER HAND MOVE I TOOK IT INTO MINE AND BROUGHT HER ON SHORE AS A CORPSE AN APOTHECARY WHO HAD JUST BEEN INSTRUCTED BY DOCTOR HAWES
83-3054-0015 OF LONDON TREATED HER PROPERLY AND SHE RECOVERED SHE WAS THE RIB OF A MAN WHO COMMANDED A VESSEL BELONGING TO HELVOETSLUYS HE WAS JUST GOING OUT OF PORT ON A VOYAGE WHEN SHE HEARING HE HAD GOT A MISTRESS WITH HIM
83-3054-0016 FOLLOWED HIM IN AN OPEN BOAT AS SOON AS SHE HAD GOT ON THE QUARTER DECK SHE FLEW AT HER HUSBAND AND ATTEMPTED TO STRIKE HIM WITH SUCH IMPETUOSITY THAT HE THOUGHT IT MOST PRUDENT TO SLIP ON ONE SIDE
83-3054-0017 AND LET HER MAKE THE IMPRESSION OF HER FINGERS UPON THE WAVES RATHER THAN HIS FACE HE WAS NOT MUCH OUT IN HIS IDEAS OF THE CONSEQUENCE FOR MEETING NO OPPOSITION SHE WENT DIRECTLY OVERBOARD
83-3054-0018 AND IT WAS MY UNFORTUNATE LOT TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR BRINGING THIS HAPPY PAIR TOGETHER AGAIN I CAN EASILY CONCEIVE WHAT EXECRATIONS THE HUSBAND LOADED ME WITH WHEN ON HIS RETURN
83-3054-0019 HE FOUND THIS GENTLE CREATURE WAITING HIS ARRIVAL AND LEARNED THE MEANS BY WHICH SHE CAME INTO THE WORLD AGAIN
83-9960-0000 THE ENIGMA WAS MORE IMPENETRABLE THAN EVER WHO WAS THIS LITTLE ONE WHOM THENARDIER HAD CALLED THE LARK WAS SHE HIS URSULE THE PRISONER HAD NOT SEEMED TO BE AFFECTED BY THAT WORD THE LARK
83-9960-0001 THIS WAS WHAT MARIUS PERCEIVED MOST CLEARLY OF ALL A SORT OF HORRIBLE FASCINATION HELD HIM NAILED TO HIS POST FROM WHICH HE WAS OBSERVING AND COMMANDING THIS WHOLE SCENE THERE HE STOOD
83-9960-0002 ALMOST INCAPABLE OF MOVEMENT OR REFLECTION AS THOUGH ANNIHILATED BY THE ABOMINABLE THINGS VIEWED AT SUCH CLOSE QUARTERS HE WAITED IN THE HOPE OF SOME INCIDENT NO MATTER OF WHAT NATURE
83-9960-0003 AND THEN I WILL GIVE MY LIFE AND MY BLOOD IF NECESSARY BUT I WILL DELIVER HER NOTHING SHALL STOP ME NEARLY HALF AN HOUR PASSED IN THIS MANNER THENARDIER SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN GLOOMY REFLECTIONS
83-9960-0004 THE PRISONER DID NOT STIR STILL MARIUS FANCIED THAT AT INTERVALS AND FOR THE LAST FEW MOMENTS HE HAD HEARD A FAINT DULL NOISE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PRISONER ALL AT ONCE THENARDIER ADDRESSED THE PRISONER
83-9960-0005 THINK THAT THE LARK REALLY IS YOUR DAUGHTER
83-9960-0006 THEY WILL BOTH ENTER THE CARRIAGE WITH MY COMRADE BEHIND SOMEWHERE OUTSIDE THE BARRIER THERE IS A TRAP HARNESSED TO TWO VERY GOOD HORSES YOUR YOUNG LADY WILL BE TAKEN TO IT SHE WILL ALIGHT FROM THE FIACRE
83-9960-0007 MY COMRADE WILL ENTER THE OTHER VEHICLE WITH HER AND MY WIFE WILL COME BACK HERE TO TELL US IT'S DONE AS FOR THE YOUNG LADY NO HARM WILL BE DONE TO HER
83-9960-0008 AND JUST AS SOON AS YOU HAVE HANDED OVER TO ME THOSE LITTLE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS SHE WILL BE RETURNED TO YOU IF YOU HAVE ME ARRESTED MY COMRADE WILL GIVE A TURN OF HIS THUMB TO THE LARK THAT'S ALL
83-9960-0009 THE PRISONER UTTERED NOT A SYLLABLE AFTER A PAUSE THENARDIER CONTINUED IT'S VERY SIMPLE AS YOU SEE THERE'LL BE NO HARM DONE UNLESS YOU WISH THAT THERE SHOULD BE HARM DONE
83-9960-0010 I'M TELLING YOU HOW THINGS STAND I WARN YOU SO THAT YOU MAY BE PREPARED HE PAUSED THE PRISONER DID NOT BREAK THE SILENCE AND THENARDIER RESUMED
83-9960-0011 AS SOON AS MY WIFE RETURNS AND SAYS TO ME THE LARK IS ON THE WAY WE WILL RELEASE YOU AND YOU WILL BE FREE TO GO AND SLEEP AT HOME YOU SEE THAT OUR INTENTIONS ARE NOT EVIL
83-9960-0012 WHAT THAT YOUNG GIRL WHOM THEY WERE ABDUCTING WAS NOT TO BE BROUGHT BACK ONE OF THOSE MONSTERS WAS TO BEAR HER OFF INTO THE DARKNESS WHITHER AND WHAT IF IT WERE SHE IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS SHE
83-9960-0013 WHAT WAS HE TO DO DISCHARGE THE PISTOL PLACE ALL THOSE SCOUNDRELS IN THE HANDS OF JUSTICE BUT THE HORRIBLE MAN WITH THE MEAT AXE WOULD NONE THE LESS BE OUT OF REACH WITH THE YOUNG GIRL
83-9960-0014 IT WAS BY THE PERIL OF THE ONE HE LOVED THAT HE FELT HIMSELF RESTRAINED THIS FRIGHTFUL SITUATION WHICH HAD ALREADY LASTED ABOVE HALF AN HOUR WAS CHANGING ITS ASPECT EVERY MOMENT
83-9960-0015 MARIUS HAD SUFFICIENT STRENGTH OF MIND TO REVIEW IN SUCCESSION ALL THE MOST HEART BREAKING CONJECTURES SEEKING HOPE AND FINDING NONE
83-9960-0016 IN THE MIDST OF THIS SILENCE THE DOOR AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STAIRCASE WAS HEARD TO OPEN AND SHUT AGAIN THE PRISONER MADE A MOVEMENT IN HIS BONDS HERE'S THE BOURGEOISE SAID THENARDIER
83-9960-0017 HE HAD HARDLY UTTERED THE WORDS WHEN THE THENARDIER WOMAN DID IN FACT RUSH HASTILY INTO THE ROOM RED PANTING BREATHLESS WITH FLAMING EYES AND CRIED AS SHE SMOTE HER HUGE HANDS ON HER THIGHS SIMULTANEOUSLY
83-9960-0018 FALSE ADDRESS THE RUFFIAN WHO HAD GONE WITH HER MADE HIS APPEARANCE BEHIND HER AND PICKED UP HIS AXE AGAIN SHE RESUMED NOBODY THERE
83-9960-0019 SHE PAUSED CHOKING THEN WENT ON
83-9960-0020 YOU ARE TOO GOOD YOU SEE IF IT HAD BEEN ME I'D HAVE CHOPPED THE BEAST IN FOUR QUARTERS TO BEGIN WITH AND IF HE HAD ACTED UGLY I'D HAVE BOILED HIM ALIVE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO SPEAK AND SAY WHERE THE GIRL IS
83-9960-0021 AND WHERE HE KEEPS HIS SHINERS THAT'S THE WAY I SHOULD HAVE MANAGED MATTERS PEOPLE ARE PERFECTLY RIGHT WHEN THEY SAY THAT MEN ARE A DEAL STUPIDER THAN WOMEN
83-9960-0022 IT'S NOTHING BUT A BIG CARRIAGE GATE
83-9960-0023 AND AFTER ALL THAT RACING AND FEE TO THE COACHMAN AND ALL I SPOKE TO BOTH THE PORTER AND THE PORTRESS A FINE STOUT WOMAN AND THEY KNOW NOTHING ABOUT HIM MARIUS BREATHED FREELY ONCE MORE
83-9960-0024 WAS SAFE WHILE HIS EXASPERATED WIFE VOCIFERATED
83-9960-0025 FOR SEVERAL MINUTES HE UTTERED NOT A WORD BUT SWUNG HIS RIGHT FOOT WHICH HUNG DOWN AND STARED AT THE BRAZIER WITH AN AIR OF SAVAGE REVERY
83-9960-0026 FINALLY HE SAID TO THE PRISONER WITH A SLOW AND SINGULARLY FEROCIOUS TONE
83-9960-0027 WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO GAIN BY THAT TO GAIN TIME CRIED THE PRISONER IN A THUNDERING VOICE AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HE SHOOK OFF HIS BONDS THEY WERE CUT
83-9960-0028 THE PRISONER WAS ONLY ATTACHED TO THE BED NOW BY ONE LEG BEFORE THE SEVEN MEN HAD TIME TO COLLECT THEIR SENSES AND DASH FORWARD HE HAD BENT DOWN INTO THE FIREPLACE HAD STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND TO THE BRAZIER
83-9960-0029 AND HAD THEN STRAIGHTENED HIMSELF UP AGAIN AND NOW THENARDIER THE FEMALE THENARDIER AND THE RUFFIANS HUDDLED IN AMAZEMENT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE HOVEL
83-9960-0030 STARED AT HIM IN STUPEFACTION AS ALMOST FREE AND IN A FORMIDABLE ATTITUDE HE BRANDISHED ABOVE HIS HEAD THE RED HOT CHISEL WHICH EMITTED A THREATENING GLOW
83-9960-0031 WHEN THE POLICE MADE THEIR DESCENT ON IT THIS SOU PIECE WAS ONE OF THOSE MARVELS OF INDUSTRY WHICH ARE ENGENDERED BY THE PATIENCE OF THE GALLEYS IN THE SHADOWS AND FOR THE SHADOWS MARVELS WHICH ARE NOTHING ELSE THAN INSTRUMENTS OF ESCAPE
83-9960-0032 ARE TO JEWELLERS WORK WHAT THE METAPHORS OF SLANG ARE TO POETRY THERE ARE BENVENUTO CELLINIS IN THE GALLEYS
83-9960-0033 THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO ASPIRES TO DELIVERANCE FINDS MEANS SOMETIMES WITHOUT TOOLS SOMETIMES WITH A COMMON WOODEN HANDLED KNIFE TO SAW A SOU INTO TWO THIN PLATES
83-9960-0034 TO HOLLOW OUT THESE PLATES WITHOUT AFFECTING THE COINAGE STAMP AND TO MAKE A FURROW ON THE EDGE OF THE SOU IN SUCH A MANNER THAT THE PLATES WILL ADHERE AGAIN THIS CAN BE SCREWED TOGETHER AND UNSCREWED AT WILL IT IS A BOX
83-9960-0035 IN THIS BOX HE HIDES A WATCH SPRING AND THIS WATCH SPRING PROPERLY HANDLED CUTS GOOD SIZED CHAINS AND BARS OF IRON THE UNFORTUNATE CONVICT IS SUPPOSED TO POSSESS MERELY A SOU NOT AT ALL
83-9960-0036 HE POSSESSES LIBERTY IT WAS A LARGE SOU OF THIS SORT
83-9960-0037 THEY ALSO FOUND A TINY SAW OF BLUE STEEL WHICH WOULD FIT THE SOU IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRISONER HAD THIS SOU PIECE ON HIS PERSON AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE RUFFIANS SEARCHED HIM THAT HE CONTRIVED TO CONCEAL IT IN HIS HAND
83-9960-0038 AS HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO BEND DOWN FOR FEAR OF BETRAYING HIMSELF HE HAD NOT CUT THE BONDS OF HIS LEFT LEG THE RUFFIANS HAD RECOVERED FROM THEIR FIRST SURPRISE BE EASY
83-9960-0039 THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME WRITE WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO WRITE THAT YOU CAN MAKE ME SAY WHAT I DO NOT CHOOSE TO SAY HE STRIPPED UP HIS LEFT SLEEVE AND ADDED SEE HERE
83-9960-0040 AT THE SAME MOMENT HE EXTENDED HIS ARM AND LAID THE GLOWING CHISEL WHICH HE HELD IN HIS LEFT HAND BY ITS WOODEN HANDLE
83-9960-0041 THE REVOLTS OF THE FLESH AND THE SENSES WHEN SUBJECTED TO PHYSICAL SUFFERING CAUSE THE SOUL TO SPRING FORTH AND MAKE IT APPEAR ON THE BROW JUST AS REBELLIONS AMONG THE SOLDIERY FORCE THE CAPTAIN TO SHOW HIMSELF
83-9960-0042 THE HORRIBLE GLOWING TOOL DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT WHIRLING AS IT FLEW AND FELL FAR AWAY ON THE SNOW THE PRISONER RESUMED DO WHAT YOU PLEASE WITH ME HE WAS DISARMED
83-9960-0043 SEIZE HIM SAID THENARDIER TWO OF THE RUFFIANS LAID THEIR HANDS ON HIS SHOULDER AND THE MASKED MAN WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE TOOK UP HIS STATION IN FRONT OF HIM
83-9960-0044 READY TO SMASH HIS SKULL AT THE SLIGHTEST MOVEMENT AT THE SAME TIME MARIUS HEARD BELOW HIM AT THE BASE OF THE PARTITION BUT SO NEAR THAT HE COULD NOT SEE WHO WAS SPEAKING THIS COLLOQUY CONDUCTED IN A LOW TONE
83-9960-0045 THERE IS ONLY ONE THING LEFT TO DO CUT HIS THROAT THAT'S IT IT WAS THE HUSBAND AND WIFE TAKING COUNSEL TOGETHER THENARDIER WALKED SLOWLY TOWARDS THE TABLE
83-9960-0046 OPENED THE DRAWER AND TOOK OUT THE KNIFE MARIUS FRETTED WITH THE HANDLE OF HIS PISTOL UNPRECEDENTED PERPLEXITY FOR THE LAST HOUR HE HAD HAD TWO VOICES IN HIS CONSCIENCE
83-9960-0047 THE ONE ENJOINING HIM TO RESPECT HIS FATHER'S TESTAMENT THE OTHER CRYING TO HIM TO RESCUE THE PRISONER THESE TWO VOICES CONTINUED UNINTERRUPTEDLY THAT STRUGGLE WHICH TORMENTED HIM TO AGONY UP TO THAT MOMENT
83-9960-0048 MARIUS CAST A WILD GLANCE ABOUT HIM THE LAST MECHANICAL RESOURCE OF DESPAIR ALL AT ONCE A SHUDDER RAN THROUGH HIM AT HIS FEET ON THE TABLE A BRIGHT RAY OF LIGHT FROM THE FULL MOON
83-9960-0049 THIS WAS THE EXPEDIENT OF WHICH HE WAS IN SEARCH THE SOLUTION OF THAT FRIGHTFUL PROBLEM WHICH WAS TORTURING HIM OF SPARING THE ASSASSIN AND SAVING THE VICTIM HE KNELT DOWN ON HIS COMMODE STRETCHED OUT HIS ARM SEIZED THE SHEET OF PAPER
83-9960-0050 SOFTLY DETACHED A BIT OF PLASTER FROM THE WALL WRAPPED THE PAPER ROUND IT AND TOSSED THE WHOLE THROUGH THE CREVICE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DEN IT WAS HIGH TIME THENARDIER HAD CONQUERED HIS LAST FEARS OR HIS LAST SCRUPLES
83-9960-0051 SHE HANDED IT TO HER HUSBAND WHERE DID THIS COME FROM DEMANDED THENARDIER PARDIE EJACULATED HIS WIFE WHERE DO YOU SUPPOSE IT CAME FROM THROUGH THE WINDOW OF COURSE
83-9960-0052 THENARDIER RAPIDLY UNFOLDED THE PAPER AND HELD IT CLOSE TO THE CANDLE IT'S IN EPONINE'S HANDWRITING THE DEVIL HE MADE A SIGN TO HIS WIFE WHO HASTILY DREW NEAR
83-9960-0053 ASKED THE THENARDIER WOMAN WE HAVEN'T THE TIME THROUGH WHAT
83-9960-0054 REPLIED THENARDIER SINCE PONINE HAS THROWN THE STONE THROUGH THE WINDOW IT INDICATES THAT THE HOUSE IS NOT WATCHED ON THAT SIDE THE MASK WITH THE VENTRILOQUIST'S VOICE DEPOSITED HIS HUGE KEY ON THE FLOOR
83-9960-0055 THENARDIER EXCLAIMED ARE YOU MAD ARE YOU CRAZY WHAT A PACK OF BOOBIES YOU WANT TO WASTE TIME DO YOU DRAW LOTS DO YOU BY A WET FINGER BY A SHORT STRAW
83-9960-0056 WITH WRITTEN NAMES THROWN INTO A HAT WOULD YOU LIKE MY HAT CRIED A VOICE ON THE THRESHOLD
831-130739-0000 THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTER IN THE STORY IF YOU PRESUMING YOU ARE OF THE SEX THAT DOES SUCH THINGS IF YOU HAD GONE INTO THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM WHICH IS REALLY ONLY MAGNIFICENT FOR SHOP
831-130739-0001 A PERFECTLY FICTITIOUS CO BY THE BYE OF PUTNEY ON THE FOURTEENTH OF AUGUST EIGHTEEN NINETY FIVE HAD TURNED TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE WHERE THE BLOCKS OF WHITE LINEN AND PILES OF BLANKETS RISE UP TO THE RAIL FROM WHICH THE PINK AND BLUE PRINTS DEPEND
831-130739-0002 YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERVED BY THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY THAT IS NOW BEGINNING HE WOULD HAVE COME FORWARD BOWING AND SWAYING
831-130739-0003 WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SHOWING YOU UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AS FOR INSTANCE HATS BABY LINEN GLOVES SILKS LACE OR CURTAINS
831-130739-0004 AND MAKING A KIND OF CIRCULAR SWEEP INVITED YOU TO STEP THIS WAY AND SO LED YOU BEYOND HIS KEN
831-130739-0005 HUCKABACK BLANKETS DIMITY CRETONNE LINEN CALICO ARE CASES IN POINT
831-130739-0006 UNDER WHICH HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES YOU MIGHT IF OF AN OBSERVING TURN OF MIND AND NOT TOO MUCH OF A HOUSEWIFE TO BE INHUMAN HAVE GIVEN THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY LESS CURSORY ATTENTION
831-130739-0007 NOW IF YOU HAD NOTICED ANYTHING ABOUT HIM IT WOULD HAVE BEEN CHIEFLY TO NOTICE HOW LITTLE HE WAS NOTICEABLE HE WORE THE BLACK MORNING COAT THE BLACK TIE AND THE SPECKLED GREY NETHER PARTS DESCENDING INTO SHADOW AND MYSTERY BELOW THE COUNTER OF HIS CRAFT
831-130739-0008 HAIR OF A KIND OF DIRTY FAIRNESS GREYISH EYES AND A SKIMPY IMMATURE MOUSTACHE UNDER HIS PEAKED INDETERMINATE NOSE HIS FEATURES WERE ALL SMALL BUT NONE ILL SHAPED A ROSETTE OF PINS DECORATED THE LAPPEL OF HIS COAT
831-130739-0009 WE COULD SHOW YOU SOMETHING BETTER OF COURSE NO TROUBLE MADAM I ASSURE YOU SUCH WERE THE SIMPLE COUNTERS OF HIS INTERCOURSE SO I SAY
831-130739-0010 HE WOULD HAVE DANCED ABOUT BEHIND THE COUNTER HAVE NEATLY REFOLDED THE GOODS HE HAD SHOWN YOU HAVE PUT ON ONE SIDE THOSE YOU SELECTED EXTRACTED A LITTLE BOOK WITH A CARBON LEAF AND A TINFOIL SHEET FROM A FIXTURE
831-130739-0011 MADE YOU OUT A LITTLE BILL IN THAT WEAK FLOURISHING HAND PECULIAR TO DRAPERS
831-130739-0012 SAYN THEN A PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE COME INTO VIEW
831-130739-0013 HAVE SCRIBBLED A STILL MORE FLOURISHING J M ALL OVER THE DOCUMENT HAVE ASKED YOU IF THERE WAS NOTHING MORE HAVE STOOD BY YOU SUPPOSING THAT YOU WERE PAYING CASH UNTIL THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF THIS STORY REAPPEARED WITH THE CHANGE
831-130739-0014 ONE GLANCE MORE AT HIM AND THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WOULD HAVE BEEN BOWING YOU OUT WITH FOUNTAINS OF CIVILITIES AT WORK ALL ABOUT YOU
831-130739-0015 BUT REAL LITERATURE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM ANECDOTE DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF WITH SUPERFICIAL APPEARANCES ALONE LITERATURE IS REVELATION MODERN LITERATURE IS INDECOROUS REVELATION
831-130739-0016 IT IS THE DUTY OF THE EARNEST AUTHOR TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN EVEN AT THE COST OF SOME BLUSHES AND THE THING THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE SEEN ABOUT THIS YOUNG MAN AND THE THING OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THIS STORY
831-130739-0017 THE THING THAT MUST BE TOLD IF THE BOOK IS TO BE WRITTEN WAS LET US FACE IT BRAVELY THE REMARKABLE CONDITION OF THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS LET US APPROACH THE BUSINESS WITH DISPASSIONATE EXPLICITNESS
831-130739-0018 LET US ASSUME SOMETHING OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT THE HARD ALMOST PROFESSORIAL TONE OF THE CONSCIENTIOUS REALIST LET US TREAT THIS YOUNG MAN'S LEGS AS A MERE DIAGRAM AND INDICATE THE POINTS OF INTEREST WITH THE UNEMOTIONAL
831-130739-0019 AND SO TO OUR REVELATION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE RIGHT ANKLE OF THIS YOUNG MAN YOU WOULD HAVE OBSERVED LADIES AND GENTLEMEN A CONTUSION AND AN ABRASION ON THE INTERNAL ASPECT OF THE LEFT ANKLE A CONTUSION ALSO
831-130739-0020 ON ITS EXTERNAL ASPECT A LARGE YELLOWISH BRUISE ON HIS LEFT SHIN THERE WERE TWO BRUISES ONE A LEADEN YELLOW GRADUATING HERE AND THERE INTO PURPLE AND ANOTHER OBVIOUSLY OF MORE RECENT DATE OF A BLOTCHY RED
831-130739-0021 TUMID AND THREATENING PROCEEDING UP THE LEFT LEG IN A SPIRAL MANNER AN UNNATURAL HARDNESS AND REDNESS WOULD HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED ON THE UPPER ASPECT OF THE CALF
831-130739-0022 AND ABOVE THE KNEE AND ON THE INNER SIDE AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPANSE OF BRUISED SURFACE A KIND OF CLOSELY STIPPLED SHADING OF CONTUSED POINTS
831-130739-0023 THE RIGHT LEG WOULD BE FOUND TO BE BRUISED IN A MARVELLOUS MANNER ALL ABOUT AND UNDER THE KNEE AND PARTICULARLY ON THE INTERIOR ASPECT OF THE KNEE SO FAR WE MAY PROCEED WITH OUR DETAILS
831-130739-0024 FIRED BY THESE DISCOVERIES AN INVESTIGATOR MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE PURSUED HIS INQUIRIES FURTHER TO BRUISES ON THE SHOULDERS ELBOWS AND EVEN THE FINGER JOINTS OF THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY
831-130739-0025 HE HAD INDEED BEEN BUMPED AND BATTERED AT AN EXTRAORDINARY NUMBER OF POINTS BUT ENOUGH OF REALISTIC DESCRIPTION IS AS GOOD AS A FEAST
831-130739-0026 EVEN IN LITERATURE ONE MUST KNOW WHERE TO DRAW THE LINE NOW THE READER MAY BE INCLINED TO WONDER HOW A RESPECTABLE YOUNG SHOPMAN
831-130739-0027 ONE MIGHT FANCY THAT HE HAD BEEN SITTING WITH HIS NETHER EXTREMITIES IN SOME COMPLICATED MACHINERY A THRESHING MACHINE SAY OR ONE OF THOSE HAY MAKING FURIES BUT SHERLOCK HOLMES
831-130739-0028 WOULD HAVE FANCIED NOTHING OF THE KIND
831-130739-0029 CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE OTHER ABRASIONS AND CONTUSIONS POINTED UNMISTAKABLY TO THE VIOLENT IMPACT OF THE MOUNTING BEGINNER UPON THE BICYCLING SADDLE AND THAT THE RUINOUS STATE OF THE RIGHT KNEE WAS EQUALLY ELOQUENT
831-130739-0030 OF THE CONCUSSIONS ATTENDANT ON THAT PERSON'S HASTY FREQUENTLY CAUSELESS AND INVARIABLY ILL CONCEIVED DESCENTS ONE LARGE BRUISE ON THE SHIN IS EVEN MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRENTICE CYCLIST
831-130739-0031 FOR UPON EVERY ONE OF THEM WAITS THE JEST OF THE UNEXPECTED TREADLE YOU TRY AT LEAST TO WALK YOUR MACHINE IN AN EASY MANNER AND WHACK YOU ARE RUBBING YOUR SHIN SO OUT OF INNOCENCE WE RIPEN
831-130739-0032 TWO BRUISES ON THAT PLACE MARK A CERTAIN WANT OF APTITUDE IN LEARNING SUCH AS ONE MIGHT EXPECT IN A PERSON UNUSED TO MUSCULAR EXERCISE BLISTERS ON THE HANDS ARE ELOQUENT OF THE NERVOUS CLUTCH OF THE WAVERING RIDER AND SO FORTH
831-130739-0033 UNTIL SHERLOCK IS PRESENTLY EXPLAINING BY THE HELP OF THE MINOR INJURIES THAT THE MACHINE RIDDEN IS AN OLD FASHIONED AFFAIR WITH A FORK INSTEAD OF THE DIAMOND FRAME A CUSHIONED TIRE WELL WORN ON THE HIND WHEEL
831-130739-0034 RISES A VISION OF A NIGHTLY STRUGGLE OF TWO DARK FIGURES AND A MACHINE IN A DARK ROAD THE ROAD TO BE EXPLICIT FROM ROEHAMPTON TO PUTNEY HILL AND WITH THIS VISION IS THE SOUND OF A HEEL SPURNING THE GRAVEL
831-130739-0035 A GASPING AND GRUNTING A SHOUTING OF STEER MAN STEER A WAVERING UNSTEADY FLIGHT A SPASMODIC TURNING OF THE MISSILE EDIFICE OF MAN AND MACHINE AND A COLLAPSE THEN YOU DESCRY DIMLY THROUGH THE DUSK
831-130739-0036 THUS EVEN IN A SHOP ASSISTANT DOES THE WARMTH OF MANHOOD ASSERT ITSELF AND DRIVE HIM AGAINST ALL THE CONDITIONS OF HIS CALLING AGAINST THE COUNSELS OF PRUDENCE AND THE RESTRICTIONS OF HIS MEANS
831-130739-0037 TO SEEK THE WHOLESOME DELIGHTS OF EXERTION AND DANGER AND PAIN AND OUR FIRST EXAMINATION OF THE DRAPER REVEALS BENEATH HIS DRAPERIES THE MAN TO WHICH INITIAL FACT AMONG OTHERS WE SHALL COME AGAIN IN THE END
831-130739-0038 BUT ENOUGH OF THESE REVELATIONS THE CENTRAL FIGURE OF OUR STORY IS NOW GOING ALONG BEHIND THE COUNTER A DRAPER INDEED WITH YOUR PURCHASES IN HIS ARMS TO THE WAREHOUSE WHERE THE VARIOUS ARTICLES YOU HAVE SELECTED WILL PRESENTLY BE PACKED BY THE SENIOR PORTER AND SENT TO YOU
831-130739-0039 AND GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE FOLDS IN HIS HANDS BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN THEM PUNCTILIOUSLY NEAR HIM IS AN APPRENTICE APPRENTICED TO THE SAME HIGH CALLING OF DRAPER'S ASSISTANT
831-130739-0040 A RUDDY RED HAIRED LAD IN A VERY SHORT TAILLESS BLACK COAT AND A VERY HIGH COLLAR WHO IS DELIBERATELY UNFOLDING AND REFOLDING SOME PATTERNS OF CRETONNE
831-130739-0041 THE ASSISTANT IS DREAMING OF THE DELICIOUS TIME ONLY FOUR HOURS OFF NOW WHEN HE WILL RESUME THE TALE OF HIS BRUISES AND ABRASIONS THE APPRENTICE IS NEARER THE LONG LONG THOUGHTS OF BOYHOOD AND HIS IMAGINATION RIDES CAP A PIE
831-130739-0042 THROUGH THE CHAMBERS OF HIS BRAIN SEEKING SOME KNIGHTLY QUEST IN HONOUR OF THAT FAIR LADY THE LAST BUT ONE OF THE GIRL APPRENTICES TO THE DRESS MAKING UPSTAIRS
831-130739-0043 HE INCLINES RATHER TO STREET FIGHTING AGAINST REVOLUTIONARIES BECAUSE THEN SHE COULD SEE HIM FROM THE WINDOW JERKING THEM BACK TO THE PRESENT COMES THE PUFFY LITTLE SHOP WALKER WITH A PAPER IN HIS HAND THE APPRENTICE BECOMES EXTREMELY ACTIVE
831-130739-0044 THEY'RE GOING FAIRLY WELL SIR
831-130739-0045 THE SHOP WALKER BRINGS UP PARALLEL TO THE COUNTER ANY PARTICULAR TIME WHEN YOU WANT YOUR HOLIDAYS HE ASKS HOOPDRIVER PULLS AT HIS SKIMPY MOUSTACHE NO DON'T WANT THEM TOO LATE SIR OF COURSE
831-130739-0046 HOW ABOUT THIS DAY WEEK HOOPDRIVER BECOMES RIGIDLY MEDITATIVE GRIPPING THE CORNERS OF THE GINGHAM FOLDS IN HIS HANDS HIS FACE IS ELOQUENT OF CONFLICTING CONSIDERATIONS CAN HE LEARN IT IN A WEEK THAT'S THE QUESTION
831-130739-0047 OTHERWISE BRIGGS WILL GET NEXT WEEK AND HE WILL HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL SEPTEMBER WHEN THE WEATHER IS OFTEN UNCERTAIN HE IS NATURALLY OF A SANGUINE DISPOSITION
831-130739-0048 ALL DRAPERS HAVE TO BE OR ELSE THEY COULD NEVER HAVE THE FAITH THEY SHOW IN THE BEAUTY WASHABILITY AND UNFADING EXCELLENCE OF THE GOODS THEY SELL YOU THE DECISION COMES AT LAST
831-130739-0049 THE NEXT IN THE STRICT SCALE OF PRECEDENCE OF THE DRAPERY EMPORIUM MISTER HOOPDRIVER IN ALTERNATING SPASMS ANON STRAIGHTENS HIS GINGHAM AND ANON BECOMES MEDITATIVE WITH HIS TONGUE IN THE HOLLOW OF HIS DECAYING WISDOM TOOTH
831-130739-0050 AT SUPPER THAT NIGHT HOLIDAY TALK HELD UNDISPUTED SWAY MISTER PRITCHARD SPOKE OF SCOTLAND MISS ISAACS CLAMOURED OF BETTWS
831-130739-0051 I SAID HOOPDRIVER WHEN THE QUESTION CAME TO HIM WHY CYCLING OF COURSE YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO RIDE THAT DREADFUL MACHINE OF YOURS DAY AFTER DAY SAID MISS HOWE OF THE COSTUME DEPARTMENT I AM
831-130739-0052 SAID HOOPDRIVER AS CALMLY AS POSSIBLE PULLING AT THE INSUFFICIENT MOUSTACHE
831-130739-0053 YOU STOW IT SAID MISTER HOOPDRIVER LOOKING HARD AND THREATENINGLY AT THE JUNIOR APPRENTICE AND SUDDENLY ADDING IN A TONE OF BITTER CONTEMPT
831-130739-0054 I'M GETTING FAIRLY SAFE UPON IT NOW HE TOLD MISS HOWE AT OTHER TIMES HOOPDRIVER MIGHT HAVE FURTHER RESENTED THE SATIRICAL EFFORTS OF THE APPRENTICE BUT HIS MIND WAS TOO FULL OF THE PROJECTED TOUR TO ADMIT ANY PETTY DELICACIES OF DIGNITY
831-130739-0055 WHEN THE GAS WAS TURNED OFF FOR THE NIGHT HE WAS SITTING ON THE EDGE OF HIS BED RUBBING ARNICA INTO HIS KNEE A NEW AND VERY BIG PLACE AND STUDYING A ROAD MAP OF THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND
831-130739-0056 WAS SITTING UP IN BED AND TRYING TO SMOKE IN THE DARK BRIGGS HAD NEVER BEEN ON A CYCLE IN HIS LIFE BUT HE FELT HOOPDRIVER'S INEXPERIENCE AND OFFERED SUCH ADVICE AS OCCURRED TO HIM HAVE THE MACHINE THOROUGHLY WELL OILED SAID BRIGGS
831-130739-0057 CARRY ONE OR TWO LEMONS WITH YOU DON'T TEAR YOURSELF TO DEATH THE FIRST DAY AND SIT UPRIGHT NEVER LOSE CONTROL OF THE MACHINE AND ALWAYS SOUND THE BELL ON EVERY POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY YOU MIND THOSE THINGS AND NOTHING VERY MUCH CAN'T HAPPEN TO YOU HOOPDRIVER YOU TAKE MY WORD
831-130739-0058 SAVE PERHAPS FOR A CURSE OR SO AT HIS PIPE AND THEN BREAK OUT WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT SET OF TIPS AVOID RUNNING OVER DOGS HOOPDRIVER WHATEVER YOU DO
831-130739-0059 NEVER LET THE MACHINE BUCKLE THERE WAS A MAN KILLED ONLY THE OTHER DAY THROUGH HIS WHEEL BUCKLING DON'T SCORCH DON'T RIDE ON THE FOOT PATH KEEP YOUR OWN SIDE OF THE ROAD AND IF YOU SEE A TRAMLINE GO ROUND THE CORNER AT ONCE AND HURRY OFF INTO THE NEXT COUNTY

831-130739-0061 HOOPDRIVER RODE OFF INTO DREAMLAND ON HIS MACHINE AND WAS SCARCELY THERE BEFORE HE WAS PITCHED BACK INTO THE WORLD OF SENSE AGAIN SOMETHING WHAT WAS IT NEVER OIL THE STEERING IT'S FATAL
831-130739-0062 A VOICE THAT CAME FROM ROUND A FITFUL GLOW OF LIGHT WAS SAYING AND CLEAN THE CHAIN DAILY WITH BLACK LEAD YOU MIND JUST A FEW LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT
831-130746-0000 THE OSTLER BEING A FOOL RUSHED VIOLENTLY DOWN THE ROAD VOCIFERATING AFTER THEM THEN HE RETURNED PANTING TO THE VICUNA HOTEL AND FINDING A GROUP OF MEN OUTSIDE THE ENTRANCE WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT WAS UP STOPPED TO GIVE THEM THE CREAM OF THE ADVENTURE
831-130746-0001 THAT GAVE THE FUGITIVES FIVE MINUTES THEN PUSHING BREATHLESSLY INTO THE BAR HE HAD TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE BARMAID WHAT THE MATTER WAS AND THE GOV'NOR BEING OUT THEY SPENT SOME MORE PRECIOUS TIME WONDERING WHAT EVER WAS TO BE DONE
831-130746-0002 THERE WERE ALSO MORAL REMARKS AND OTHER IRRELEVANT CONTRIBUTIONS THERE WERE CONFLICTING IDEAS OF TELLING THE POLICE AND PURSUING THE FLYING COUPLE ON A HORSE THAT MADE TEN MINUTES
831-130746-0003 THEN STEPHEN THE WAITER WHO HAD SHOWN HOOPDRIVER UP CAME DOWN AND LIT WONDERFUL LIGHTS AND STARTED QUITE A FRESH DISCUSSION BY THE SIMPLE QUESTION WHICH THAT TURNED TEN MINUTES INTO A QUARTER OF AN HOUR AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS DISCUSSION
831-130746-0004 MAKING A SUDDEN AND AWESTRICKEN SILENCE APPEARED BECHAMEL IN THE HALL BEYOND THE BAR WALKED WITH A RESOLUTE AIR TO THE FOOT OF THE STAIRCASE AND PASSED OUT OF SIGHT YOU CONCEIVE THE BACKWARD PITCH OF THAT EXCEPTIONALLY SHAPED CRANIUM
831-130746-0005 INCREDULOUS EYES STARED INTO ONE ANOTHER'S IN THE BAR AS HIS PACES MUFFLED BY THE STAIR CARPET WENT UP TO THE LANDING TURNED REACHED THE PASSAGE AND WALKED INTO THE DINING ROOM OVERHEAD

831-130746-0018 SHE HAD EVIDENTLY GONE OFF WITH HIM AND THAT LITTLE BUSINESS WAS OVER AND HE WAS HERE STRANDED AND SOLD
831-130746-0019 AND HIS ONLY RAY OF HOPE WAS THAT IT SEEMED MORE PROBABLE AFTER ALL THAT THE GIRL HAD ESCAPED THROUGH HER STEPMOTHER IN WHICH CASE THE BUSINESS MIGHT BE HUSHED UP YET AND THE EVIL HOUR OF EXPLANATION WITH HIS WIFE INDEFINITELY POSTPONED
831-130746-0020 KNICKERBOCKERS WENT FRISKING ACROSS HIS MIND AGAIN AND HE REVERTED TO HIS BLASPHEMIES HE STARTED UP IN A GUSTY FRENZY WITH A VAGUE IDEA OF PURSUIT AND INCONTINENTLY SAT DOWN AGAIN WITH A CONCUSSION THAT STIRRED THE BAR BELOW TO ITS DEPTHS

831-130746-0022 I BECHAMEL WHEN WITH AN ABRUPT TAP AND PROMPT OPENING OF THE DOOR STEPHEN ENTERED WITH THE BOURBON
831-130746-0023 THE MOONLIGHT RIDE AND SO THE TWENTY MINUTES LAW PASSED INTO AN INFINITY
831-130746-0024 THE WRETCHED CREATURE HAS ALREADY SUFFICIENTLY SULLIED OUR MODEST BUT TRUTHFUL PAGES WE LEAVE THE EAGER LITTLE GROUP IN THE BAR OF THE VICUNA HOTEL WE LEAVE ALL BOGNOR AS WE HAVE LEFT ALL CHICHESTER
831-130746-0025 AND MIDHURST AND HASLEMERE AND GUILDFORD AND RIPLEY AND PUTNEY AND FOLLOW THIS DEAR FOOL OF A HOOPDRIVER OF OURS AND HIS YOUNG LADY IN GREY OUT UPON THE MOONLIGHT ROAD HOW THEY RODE
831-130746-0026 HOW THEIR HEARTS BEAT TOGETHER AND THEIR BREATH CAME FAST AND HOW EVERY SHADOW WAS ANTICIPATION AND EVERY NOISE PURSUIT FOR ALL THAT FLIGHT MISTER HOOPDRIVER WAS IN THE WORLD OF ROMANCE HAD A POLICEMAN INTERVENED BECAUSE THEIR LAMPS WERE NOT LIT
831-130746-0027 HOOPDRIVER HAD CUT HIM DOWN AND RIDDEN ON AFTER THE FASHION OF A HERO BORN HAD BECHAMEL ARISEN IN THE WAY WITH RAPIERS FOR A DUEL HOOPDRIVER HAD FOUGHT AS ONE TO WHOM AGINCOURT WAS A REALITY AND DRAPERY A DREAM
831-130746-0028 IT WAS RESCUE ELOPEMENT GLORY AND SHE BY THE SIDE OF HIM HE HAD SEEN HER FACE IN SHADOW
831-130746-0029 HE HAD SEEN HER TROUBLED AND HER EYES BRIGHT WITH TEARS BUT WHAT LIGHT IS THERE LIGHTING A FACE LIKE HERS TO COMPARE WITH THE SOFT GLAMOUR OF THE MIDSUMMER MOON THE ROAD TURNED NORTHWARD GOING ROUND THROUGH THE OUTSKIRTS OF BOGNOR
831-130746-0030 THEN AMIDST VILLAS AGAIN SOME WARM AND LAMPLIT SOME WHITE AND SLEEPING IN THE MOONLIGHT THEN BETWEEN HEDGES OVER WHICH THEY SAW BROAD WAN MEADOWS SHROUDED IN A LOW LYING MIST
831-130746-0031 THEY SCARCELY HEEDED WHITHER THEY RODE AT FIRST BEING ONLY ANXIOUS TO GET AWAY TURNING ONCE WESTWARD WHEN THE SPIRE OF CHICHESTER CATHEDRAL ROSE SUDDENLY NEAR THEM OUT OF THE DEWY NIGHT PALE AND INTRICATE AND HIGH
831-130746-0032 AT A FOOTFALL AT A ROUGHNESS IN THE ROAD SHE SEEMED TO BE TOO INTENT UPON ESCAPE TO GIVE MUCH THOUGHT TO HIM
831-130746-0033 HIS MIND BECAME AN ENORMOUS APPRECIATION OF THE POSITION THE NIGHT WAS A WARM WHITE SILENCE SAVE FOR THE SUBTILE RUNNING OF THEIR CHAINS
831-130746-0034 HE LOOKED SIDEWAYS AT HER AS SHE SAT BESIDE HIM WITH HER ANKLES GRACEFULLY RULING THE TREADLES NOW THE ROAD TURNED WESTWARD AND SHE WAS A DARK GREY OUTLINE AGAINST THE SHIMMER OF THE MOON
831-130746-0035 AND NOW THEY FACED NORTHWARDS AND THE SOFT COLD LIGHT PASSED CARESSINGLY OVER HER HAIR AND TOUCHED HER BROW AND CHEEK THERE IS A MAGIC QUALITY IN MOONSHINE IT TOUCHES ALL THAT IS SWEET AND BEAUTIFUL AND THE REST OF THE NIGHT IS HIDDEN
831-130746-0036 IT HAS CREATED THE FAIRIES WHOM THE SUNLIGHT KILLS AND FAIRYLAND RISES AGAIN IN OUR HEARTS AT THE SIGHT OF IT THE VOICES OF THE FILMY ROUTE
831-130746-0037 WHITE DUST HOT UNDERFOOT BLINDING TO THE EYE IS NOW A SOFT GREY SILENCE WITH THE GLITTER OF A CRYSTAL GRAIN SET STARLIKE IN ITS SILVER HERE AND THERE OVERHEAD RIDING SERENELY THROUGH THE SPACIOUS BLUE IS THE MOTHER OF THE SILENCE

831-130746-0055 ALMOST KNEELING IN FRONT OF HER WITH AN UNREASONABLE APPROBATION IN HER EYES IT WAS AS I HAVE INDICATED THE HOUR AND SEASON OF THE FULL MOON
831-130746-0056 AND IT WAS CHIEFLY BY GOOD LUCK AND THE FACT THAT MOST ROADS ABOUT A TOWN CONVERGE THEREUPON THAT CHICHESTER WAS AT LAST ATTAINED IT SEEMED AT FIRST AS THOUGH EVERYONE HAD GONE TO BED BUT THE RED HOTEL STILL GLOWED YELLOW AND WARM

8312-279790-0004 THE KING NOTICED HER MORE AND MORE HE SPOKE LESS AND LESS OF THE DEPARTED QUEEN BY AND BY HE CEASED TO SPEAK OF HER AT ALL THE END WAS THAT HE COURTED THE INCONSOLABLE LADY IN THE BLACK VEIL AND MARRIED HER
8312-279790-0005 BY HIS FIRST MARRIAGE HE HAD ONE DAUGHTER CALLED FLORINA OR THE LITTLE FLORA BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FRESH AND LOVELY AT THE TIME OF HIS SECOND MARRIAGE SHE WAS QUITE FIFTEEN YEARS OLD THE NEW QUEEN ALSO HAD A DAUGHTER
8312-279790-0006 WHO WAS BEING BROUGHT UP BY HER GODMOTHER THE FAIRY SOUSSIO HER NAME WAS TROUTINA BECAUSE HER COMPLEXION WAS ALL SPOTTED LIKE A TROUT'S BACK INDEED SHE WAS ALTOGETHER UGLY AND DISAGREEABLE AND WHEN CONTRASTED WITH FLORINA
8312-279790-0007 THE KING DISPUTED NOTHING INDEED HE NEVER DID THE QUEEN RULED HIM IN ALL THINGS SOME TIME AFTER NEWS CAME THAT KING CHARMING WOULD SHORTLY ARRIVE
8312-279790-0008 WHEN THE QUEEN HEARD THIS NEWS SHE SENT FOR MILLINERS DRESSMAKERS JEWELLERS AND DECKED TROUTINA FROM HEAD TO FOOT BUT TO FLORINA SHE ALLOWED NOT A SINGLE NEW FROCK THE POOR PRINCESS HAD TO PUT ON HER OLD ONE
8312-279790-0009 WHO PRESENTED TO HIM TROUTINA ALL BLAZING WITH JEWELS YET SO UGLY THAT KING CHARMING INVOLUNTARILY TURNED AWAY HIS EYES BUT MADAM IS THERE NOT ANOTHER PRINCESS CALLED FLORINA
8312-279790-0010 HE ROSE AND MADE HER A PROFOUND REVERENCE PAYING HER BESIDES SO MANY ELEGANT COMPLIMENTS THAT THE QUEEN BECAME VERY MUCH DISPLEASED KING CHARMING TOOK NO HEED
8312-279790-0011 BUT CONVERSED WITH FLORINA FOR THREE HOURS WITHOUT STOPPING INDEED HIS ADMIRATION OF HER WAS SO PLAIN THAT THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA BEGGED OF THE KING THAT SHE MIGHT BE SHUT UP IN A TOWER DURING THE WHOLE TIME OF HIS VISIT
8312-279790-0012 FOUR MEN IN MASKS ENTERED AND CARRIED HER OFF LEAVING HER IN A DARK CELL AND IN THE UTMOST DESOLATION MEANTIME KING CHARMING EAGERLY AWAITED HER RE APPEARANCE BUT HE SAW HER NO MORE
8312-279790-0013 AND BY THE QUEEN'S ORDERS EVERY ONE ABOUT HIM SPOKE ALL THE EVIL THEY COULD OF POOR FLORINA BUT HE REFUSED TO BELIEVE ONE WORD NO SAID HE NATURE COULD NOT HAVE UNITED A BASE NATURE TO SUCH A SWEET INNOCENT FACE
8312-279790-0014 FLORINA SHUT UP IN HER TOWER LAMENTED BITTERLY AH WOULD I HAD BEEN SENT HERE BEFORE I SAW THIS AMIABLE PRINCE WHO WAS SO KIND TO ME IT IS TO PREVENT MY MEETING HIM AGAIN THAT THE QUEEN TREATS ME SO CRUELLY
8312-279790-0015 ALAS THE LITTLE BEAUTY I HAVE HAS COST ME SORE THE QUEEN TO WIN KING CHARMING FOR HER DAUGHTER MADE HIM MANY PRESENTS AMONG THE REST AN ORDER OF KNIGHTHOOD A GOLDEN HEART
8312-279790-0016 BUT PIERCED BY ONE ONLY THE MOTTO BEING SHE ALONE THE HEART WAS MADE OF A SINGLE RUBY AS BIG AS AN OSTRICH'S EGG
8312-279790-0017 A FINGER'S LENGTH AND THE CHAIN WAS OF PEARLS EACH WEIGHING A POUND WHEN THE YOUNG KING RECEIVED THIS VERY HANDSOME PRESENT HE WAS MUCH PERPLEXED
8312-279790-0018 AS I CANNOT FULFIL IT TO TROUTINA I WOULD RATHER DECLINE THE FAVOUR SHE OFFERS ME THAN BECOME UNWORTHY OF IT CIVIL AS THIS ANSWER WAS IT IRRITATED THE QUEEN AND HER DAUGHTER EXCEEDINGLY
8312-279790-0019 AND WHEN SINCE IN ALL HIS AUDIENCES WITH THEIR MAJESTIES HE NEVER SAW FLORINA HE AT LAST INQUIRED WHERE THE YOUNGER PRINCESS WAS THE QUEEN ANSWERED FIERCELY THAT SHE WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON AND WOULD REMAIN THERE TILL TROUTINA WAS MARRIED
8312-279790-0020 WHEN HE WAS ALONE HE SENT FOR ONE OF HIS ATTENDANTS WHOM HE TRUSTED VERY MUCH AND BEGGED HIM TO GAIN INFORMATION FROM SOME COURT LADY ABOUT THE PRINCESS FLORINA THIS SCHEME SUCCEEDED SO WELL
8312-279790-0021 NEXT NIGHT TROUTINA THICKLY VEILED
8312-279790-0022 KING CHARMING MET HER RECEIVED HER IN HIS ARMS AND VOWED TO LOVE HER FOR EVER THEN HE LIFTED HER INTO THE FAIRY CHARIOT AND THEY SAILED ABOUT IN THE AIR FOR SOME HOURS
8312-279790-0023 BUT AS HE WAS NOT LIKELY TO WISH TO SAIL ABOUT FOR EVER HE AT LAST PROPOSED THAT THEY SHOULD DESCEND TO EARTH AND BE MARRIED TROUTINA AGREED WITH ALL HER HEART BUT WISHED THAT THE CEREMONY SHOULD BE PERFORMED AT HER GODMOTHER'S
8312-279790-0024 MY CHILD REPLIED THE GODMOTHER THAT IS MORE EASILY SAID THAN DONE HE IS TOO DEEPLY IN LOVE WITH FLORINA MEANTIME THE KING WAS LEFT WAITING IN A CHAMBER WITH DIAMOND WALLS SO THIN AND TRANSPARENT
8312-279790-0025 THAT THROUGH THEM HE SAW TROUTINA AND SOUSSIO CONVERSING TOGETHER HE STOOD LIKE A MAN IN A DREAM WHAT AM I BETRAYED HAS THIS ENEMY TO MY PEACE CARRIED AWAY MY DEAR FLORINA
8312-279790-0026 HOW GREAT WAS HIS DESPAIR WHEN SOUSSIO SAID TO HIM IN A COMMANDING VOICE KING CHARMING BEHOLD THE PRINCESS TROUTINA TO WHOM YOU HAVE PROMISED YOUR FAITH MARRY HER IMMEDIATELY

8312-279790-0032 IMMEDIATELY THE KING'S FIGURE CHANGED HIS ARMS FORMED THEMSELVES INTO WINGS HIS LEGS AND FEET TURNED BLACK AND THIN AND CLAWS GREW UPON THEM
8312-279790-0033 HIS BODY WASTED INTO THE SLENDER SHAPE OF A BIRD AND WAS COVERED WITH BRIGHT BLUE FEATHERS HIS EYES BECAME ROUND AND BEADY HIS NOSE AN IVORY BEAK AND HIS CROWN WAS A WHITE PLUME ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD
8312-279790-0034 HE BEGAN TO SPEAK IN A SINGING VOICE AND THEN UTTERING A DOLEFUL CRY FLED AWAY AS FAR AS POSSIBLE FROM THE FATAL PALACE OF SOUSSIO BUT THOUGH HE LOOKED ONLY A BLUE BIRD
8312-279790-0035 THE KING WAS HIS OWN NATURAL SELF STILL AND REMEMBERED ALL HIS MISFORTUNES AND DID NOT CEASE TO LAMENT FOR HIS BEAUTIFUL FLORINA FLYING FROM TREE TO TREE HE SANG MELANCHOLY SONGS ABOUT HER AND HIMSELF
8312-279790-0036 AND WISHED HE WERE DEAD MANY A TIME THE FAIRY SOUSSIO SENT BACK TROUTINA TO HER MOTHER WHO WAS FURIOUS FLORINA SHALL REPENT HAVING PLEASED KING CHARMING CRIED SHE

8312-279790-0040 BUT IT WAS TOO DARK TO SEE WHO SHE WAS AND AT DAYLIGHT SHE SHUT THE WINDOW NEXT NIGHT IT WAS BROAD MOONLIGHT AND THEN HE SAW CLEARLY THE FIGURE OF A YOUNG GIRL WEEPING SORE AND KNEW THAT IT WAS HIS BELOVED FLORINA
8312-279790-0041 WHEN SHE PAUSED IN HER LAMENTATIONS ADORABLE PRINCESS SAID HE WHY DO YOU MOURN YOUR TROUBLES ARE NOT WITHOUT REMEDY WHO SPEAKS TO ME SO GENTLY ASKED SHE
8312-279790-0042 A KING WHO LOVES YOU AND WILL NEVER LOVE ANY OTHER SO SAYING HE FLEW UP TO THE WINDOW AND AT FIRST FRIGHTENED THE PRINCESS VERY MUCH FOR SHE COULD NOT UNDERSTAND SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY THING
8312-279790-0043 AS A BIRD WHO TALKED IN WORDS LIKE A MAN YET KEPT STILL THE PIPING VOICE OF A NIGHTINGALE BUT SOON SHE BEGAN STROKING HIS BEAUTIFUL PLUMAGE AND CARESSING HIM WHO ARE YOU CHARMING BIRD
8312-279790-0044 YOU HAVE SPOKEN MY NAME I AM KING CHARMING CONDEMNED TO BE A BIRD FOR SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE I WILL NOT RENOUNCE YOU AH DO NOT DECEIVE ME I KNOW YOU HAVE MARRIED TROUTINA
8312-279790-0045 SANG THE BLUE BIRD AND TOLD HER HIS WHOLE STORY WHICH COMFORTED HER SO MUCH THAT SHE THOUGHT NO MORE OF HER MISFORTUNES THEY CONVERSED TILL DAYBREAK AND PROMISED FAITHFULLY EVERY NIGHT TO MEET AGAIN THUS
8312-279790-0046 WHAT SHOULD I DO IF I SAW HIS POOR FEATHERS SCATTERED ON THE GROUND AND KNEW THAT HE WAS NO MORE SO SHE GRIEVED ALL DAY LONG THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE BIRD HID IN A HOLLOW TREE SPENT THE HOURS IN THINKING OF HIS PRINCESS
8312-279790-0047 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME DIAMOND EAR RINGS WHICH HE BROUGHT BACK IN HIS BEAK AND WHEN NIGHT CAME OFFERED THEM TO FLORINA SO NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE BROUGHT HER SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL AND THEY TALKED TOGETHER TILL DAY
8312-279790-0048 WHERE HE SANG HER PRAISES IN A VOICE SO SWEET THAT THE PASSERS BY THOUGHT IT WAS NOT A BIRD BUT A SPIRIT RUMOURS WENT ABOUT THAT THE PLACE WAS HAUNTED AND NO ONE WOULD GO NEAR THE SPOT
8312-279790-0049 AND THOUGH SHE SAW NOBODY AND HE LIVED IN THE HOLLOW OF A TREE THEY ALWAYS FOUND PLENTY TO SAY TO ONE ANOTHER THE MALICIOUS QUEEN TRIED WITH ALL HER MIGHT TO GET TROUTINA MARRIED BUT IN VAIN NOBODY WOULD HAVE HER
8312-279790-0050 IF IT WERE FLORINA NOW SAID THE KINGS OR THE KINGS AMBASSADORS WE SHOULD BE MOST HAPPY TO SIGN THE CONTRACT THAT GIRL THWARTS US STILL SAID THE QUEEN
8312-279790-0051 WHO LIKED TO SEE HER LOVELY AND SHE HAD ADORNED HERSELF WITH ALL THE PRETTY THINGS HE HAD GIVEN HER HE PERCHED ON THE WINDOW SILL AND SHE SAT AT THE WINDOW AND THEY WERE SINGING TOGETHER A DUET WHICH THE QUEEN HEARD OUTSIDE

8312-279791-0005 AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED THE QUEEN LEFT HER AND WENT TO HOLD COUNSEL WITH TROUTINA AS TO WHAT WAS TO BE DONE THEY AGREED TO PUT IN FLORINA'S CHAMBER A WAITING MAID WHO SHOULD WATCH HER FROM MORNING TILL NIGHT
8312-279791-0006 WHEN THE PRINCESS LEARNT THIS SHE WAS IN GREAT GRIEF ALAS CRIED SHE I CAN NO LONGER TALK WITH MY BIRD WHO LOVED ME SO
8312-279791-0007 BUT THE SERVING MAID WATCHED HER NIGHT AND DAY AT LAST OVERCOME WITH WEARINESS THE GIRL FELL ASLEEP AND THEN FLORINA OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG IN A LOW VOICE BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0008 THE BLUE BIRD FLEW TO THE WINDOW SILL AND THEY LAVISHED ON ONE ANOTHER A HUNDRED CARESSES AND TALKED TOGETHER TILL DAWN NEXT NIGHT IT HAPPENED THE SAME TILL THEY BEGAN TO HOPE THAT THE WAITING MAID
8312-279791-0009 WHO WARBLED IN HER EAR AND TOUCHED HER GENTLY WITH HIS BEAK THE SPY LISTENED AND HEARD ALL THEIR CONVERSATION VERY MUCH ASTONISHED THAT A PRINCESS COULD BE SO FOND OF A MERE BIRD WHEN DAY CAME
8312-279791-0010 SHE RELATED ALL TO THE QUEEN AND TROUTINA WHO CONCLUDED THAT THE BIRD COULD BE NO OTHER THAN KING CHARMING THEY SENT THE GIRL BACK TOLD HER TO EXPRESS NO CURIOSITY BUT TO FEIGN SLEEP
8312-279791-0011 AND TO GO TO BED EARLIER THAN USUAL THEN THE POOR DECEIVED PRINCESS OPENED HER LITTLE WINDOW AND SANG HER USUAL SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD COME TO MY SIDE
8312-279791-0012 BUT NO BLUE BIRD APPEARED THE QUEEN HAD CAUSED SHARP KNIVES TO BE HUNG OUTSIDE THE HOLLOW OF THE TREE HE FLEW AGAINST THEM AND CUT HIS FEET AND WINGS TILL HE DROPPED DOWN COVERED WITH BLOOD
8312-279791-0013 OH FLORINA COME TO MY HELP SIGHED HE BUT SHE IS DEAD I KNOW AND I WILL DIE ALSO AT THAT MOMENT HIS FRIEND THE MAGICIAN
8312-279791-0014 HAD GONE EIGHT TIMES ROUND THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HIM MADE HIS NINTH JOURNEY AND CAME TO THE TREE WHERE THE POOR BLUE BIRD LAY CALLING OUT KING CHARMING KING CHARMING THE KING RECOGNISED THE VOICE OF HIS BEST FRIEND
8312-279791-0015 WHY CAN I NOT RETURN AND GOVERN IT AS BEFORE I FEAR REPLIED HIS FRIEND THAT THE THING IS DIFFICULT WHO WOULD OBEY A BLUE BIRD AH THAT IS TOO TRUE CRIED THE KING SADLY
8312-279791-0016 PEOPLE ONLY JUDGE BY THE OUTSIDE MEANTIME FLORINA OVERCOME WITH GRIEF FELL DANGEROUSLY SICK AND IN HER SICKNESS SHE KEPT SINGING DAY AND NIGHT HER LITTLE SONG BLUE BIRD BLUE BIRD
8312-279791-0017 COME TO MY SIDE BUT NO ONE REGARDED HER AT LAST A SUDDEN CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN HER FORTUNES THE KING HER FATHER DIED AND THE PEOPLE WHO KNEW SHE WAS HIS HEIR BEGAN TO INQUIRE WITH ONE ACCORD
8312-279791-0018 WHERE WAS THE PRINCESS FLORINA THEY ASSAILED THE PALACE IN CROWDS DEMANDING HER FOR THEIR SOVEREIGN THE RIOT BECAME SO DANGEROUS THAT TROUTINA AND HER MOTHER FLED AWAY TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0019 RESTORED FLORINA'S HEALTH AND GAVE HER STRENGTH TO CALL A COUNCIL AND ARRANGE ALL THE AFFAIRS OF HER KINGDOM THEN SHE DEPARTED BY NIGHT AND ALONE TO GO OVER THE WORLD IN SEARCH OF HER BLUE BIRD THE MAGICIAN
8312-279791-0020 WHO WAS KING CHARMING'S FRIEND WENT TO THE FAIRY SOUSSIO WHOM HE KNEW FOR THEY HAD QUARRELLED AND MADE IT UP AGAIN AS FAIRIES AND MAGICIANS DO MANY TIMES WITHIN THE LAST FIVE OR SIX HUNDRED YEARS
8312-279791-0021 SHE RECEIVED HIM CIVILLY AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED HE TRIED TO MAKE A BARGAIN WITH HER BUT COULD EFFECT NOTHING UNLESS KING CHARMING WOULD CONSENT TO MARRY TROUTINA THE ENCHANTER FOUND THIS BRIDE SO UGLY
8312-279791-0022 THAT HE COULD NOT ADVISE STILL THE BLUE BIRD HAD RUN SO MANY RISKS IN HIS CAGE THE NAIL IT WAS HUNG UPON HAD BROKEN AND THE KING SUFFERED MUCH IN THE FALL MINETTA THE CAT HAD GLOWERED AT HIM WITH HER GREEN EYES
8312-279791-0023 HE HAD BEEN A LINNET OR A JAY WORSE THAN ALL HIS NEXT HEIR SPREAD REPORTS OF HIS DEATH
8312-279791-0024 UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE MAGICIAN THOUGHT IT BEST TO AGREE WITH SOUSSIO THAT KING CHARMING SHOULD BE RESTORED TO HIS KINGDOM AND HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SIX MONTHS ON CONDITION THAT TROUTINA SHOULD REMAIN IN HIS PALACE
8312-279791-0025 BUT HE THOUGHT LESS OF THESE THINGS THAN HOW TO ESCAPE FROM THE HORROR OF MARRYING TROUTINA MEANWHILE THE QUEEN FLORINA IN A PEASANT'S DRESS WITH A STRAW HAT ON HER HEAD AND A CANVAS SACK ON HER SHOULDER
8312-279791-0026 WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE ALL ALONE GOOD MOTHER REPLIED THE QUEEN I HAVE TOO MANY TROUBLES TO BE PLEASANT COMPANY FOR ANYBODY TELL ME YOUR TROUBLES AND I MAY BE ABLE TO SOFTEN THEM
8312-279791-0027 DO NOT AFFLICT YOURSELF HAPPINESS WILL YET BE YOURS TAKE THESE FOUR EGGS AND WHENEVER YOU ARE IN TROUBLE BREAK THEM AND SEE WHAT ENSUES SO SAYING THE FAIRY VANISHED FLORINA
8312-279791-0028 GREATLY COMFORTED PUT THE EGGS IN HER SACK
8312-279791-0029 SHE WALKED EIGHT DAYS AND NIGHTS WITHOUT STOPPING AND THEN CAME TO A MOUNTAIN MADE ENTIRELY OF IVORY AND NEARLY PERPENDICULAR DESPAIRING OF EVER CLIMBING IT
8312-279791-0030 SHE SANK DOWN AT THE FOOT PREPARED TO DIE THERE WHEN SHE BETHOUGHT HERSELF OF THE EGGS LET ME SEE SAID SHE IF THE FAIRY HAS DECEIVED ME OR NOT SO SHE BROKE ONE AND INSIDE IT WERE LITTLE HOOKS OF GOLD
8312-279791-0031 WHICH SHE FITTED ON HER FEET AND HANDS AND BY MEANS OF WHICH SHE CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN WITH EASE ARRIVED AT THE SUMMIT SHE FOUND NEW DIFFICULTIES FOR THE VALLEY BELOW WAS ONE LARGE SMOOTH MIRROR
8312-279791-0032 IN WHICH SIXTY THOUSAND WOMEN STOOD ADMIRING THEMSELVES THEY HAD NEED FOR THE CHARM OF THE MIRROR WAS THAT EACH SAW HERSELF THEREIN NOT AS SHE WAS BUT AS SHE WISHED TO BE
8312-279791-0033 AND THE GRIMACES THEY MADE WERE ENOUGH TO CAUSE A PERSON TO DIE OF LAUGHTER NOT ONE OF THEM HAD EVER GAINED THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN AND WHEN THEY SAW FLORINA THERE THEY ALL BURST INTO ANGRY OUTCRIES
8312-279791-0034 WILL YOU CONVEY ME TO THE PALACE OF KING CHARMING THE OBEDIENT PIGEONS DID SO FLYING DAY AND NIGHT TILL THEY REACHED THE CITY GATES WHEN THE QUEEN DISMISSED THEM WITH A SWEET KISS WHICH WAS WORTH MORE THAN HER CROWN
8312-279791-0035 BESIDES HE IS GOING TO MORROW TO THE TEMPLE WITH THE PRINCESS TROUTINA WHOM HE HAS AT LAST AGREED TO MARRY FLORINA SAT DOWN ON A DOOR STEP AND HID HER FACE UNDER HER STRAW HAT AND HER DROOPING HAIR
8312-279791-0036 ALAS SHE CRIED MY BLUE BIRD HAS FORSAKEN ME SHE NEITHER ATE NOR SLEPT BUT ROSE WITH THE DAWN AND PUSHED HER WAY THROUGH THE GUARDS TO THE TEMPLE WHERE SHE SAW TWO THRONES ONE FOR KING CHARMING
8312-279791-0037 AND THE OTHER FOR TROUTINA THEY ARRIVED SHORTLY HE MORE CHARMING AND SHE MORE REPULSIVE THAN EVER KNITTING HER BROWS TROUTINA EXCLAIMED WHAT CREATURE IS THAT WHO DARES APPROACH SO NEAR MY GOLDEN THRONE
8312-279791-0038 THESE ARE PRETTY TRINKETS SAID TROUTINA AND GOING UP TO THE KING SHE ASKED HIM WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THEM AT SIGHT OF THE ORNAMENTS HE TURNED PALE REMEMBERING THOSE HE HAD GIVEN TO FLORINA
8312-279791-0039 THESE BRACELETS ARE WORTH HALF MY KINGDOM I DID NOT THINK THERE HAD BEEN MORE THAN ONE PAIR IN THE WORLD THEN I WILL BUY THESE SAID TROUTINA BUT FLORINA REFUSED TO SELL THEM FOR MONEY
8312-279791-0040 THE PRICE SHE ASKED WAS PERMISSION TO SLEEP A NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AS YOU WILL YOUR BARGAINS ARE CHEAP ENOUGH REPLIED TROUTINA LAUGHING AND WHEN SHE LAUGHED SHE SHOWED TEETH LIKE THE TUSKS OF A WILD BOAR
8312-279791-0041 NOW THE KING WHEN HE WAS A BLUE BIRD HAD INFORMED FLORINA ABOUT THIS CHAMBER OF ECHOES WHERE EVERY WORD SPOKEN COULD BE HEARD IN HIS OWN CHAMBER
8312-279791-0042 BUT SHE HAD NO MORE JEWELS TO TEMPT TROUTINA SO SHE BROKE THE THIRD EGG OUT OF IT CAME A CHARIOT OF POLISHED STEEL INLAID WITH GOLD DRAWN BY SIX GREEN MICE THE COACHMAN BEING A ROSE COLOURED RAT
8312-279791-0043 AND THE POSTILION A GREY ONE INSIDE THE CARRIAGE SAT LITTLE PUPPETS WHO BEHAVED THEMSELVES JUST LIKE LIVE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WHEN TROUTINA WENT TO WALK IN THE PALACE GARDEN FLORINA AWAITED HER IN A GREEN ALLEY
8312-279791-0044 AND MADE THE MICE GALLOP AND THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN BOW TILL THE PRINCESS WAS DELIGHTED AND READY TO BUY THE CURIOSITY AT ANY PRICE AGAIN FLORINA EXACTED PERMISSION TO PASS THE NIGHT IN THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES AND AGAIN THE KING
8312-279791-0045 UNDISTURBED BY HER LAMENTATION SLEPT WITHOUT WAKING TILL DAWN THE THIRD DAY ONE OF THE PALACE VALETS PASSING HER BY SAID YOU STUPID PEASANT GIRL IT IS WELL THE KING TAKES OPIUM EVERY NIGHT
8312-279791-0046 OR YOU WOULD DISTURB HIM BY THAT TERRIBLE SOBBING OF YOURS DOES HE SO SAID THE QUEEN NOW COMPREHENDING ALL THEN IF YOU WILL PROMISE TO NIGHT TO KEEP THE OPIUM CUP OUT OF HIS WAY THESE PEARLS AND DIAMONDS
8312-279791-0047 AND SHE TOOK A HANDFUL OF THEM FROM HER SACK SHALL ASSUREDLY BE YOURS THE VALET PROMISED AND THEN FLORINA BROKE HER FOURTH EGG OUT OF WHICH CAME A PIE COMPOSED OF BIRDS WHICH THOUGH THEY HAD BEEN PLUCKED
8312-279791-0048 BAKED AND MADE READY FOR THE TABLE SANG AS BEAUTIFULLY AS BIRDS THAT ARE ALIVE TROUTINA CHARMED WITH THIS MARVELLOUS NOVELTY BOUGHT IT AT THE SAME PRICE AS THE REST ADDING GENEROUSLY A SMALL PIECE OF GOLD
8312-279791-0049 THEN HE ROSE UP DRESSED HIMSELF HASTILY AND WENT IN SEARCH OF HER SHE WAS SITTING MOURNFULLY ON THE FLOOR WITH HER HAIR HIDING HER FACE AND HER EYES SWOLLEN WITH TEARS BUT HE KNEW AT ONCE HIS FAITHFUL FLORINA
8312-279791-0050 AND THEY EMBRACED AND WEPT TOGETHER FOR WHAT WAS THE GOOD OF ALL THEIR LOVE WHEN THEY WERE STILL IN THE POWER OF THE FAIRY SOUSSIO BUT AT THIS MOMENT APPEARED THE FRIENDLY ENCHANTER WITH A FAIRY STILL GREATER THAN SOUSSIO
8312-279791-0051 THE ONE WHO HAD GIVEN FLORINA THE FOUR EGGS THEY DECLARED THAT THEIR UNITED POWER WAS STRONGER THAN SOUSSIO'S AND THAT THE LOVERS SHOULD BE MARRIED WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY WHEN THIS NEWS REACHED TROUTINA SHE RAN TO THE CHAMBER OF ECHOES
8312-279791-0052 AND THERE BEHELD HER BEAUTIFUL RIVAL WHOM SHE HAD SO CRUELLY AFFLICTED BUT THE MOMENT SHE OPENED HER MOUTH TO SPEAK HER WICKED TONGUE WAS SILENCED FOR EVER FOR THE MAGICIAN TURNED HER INTO A TROUT WHICH HE FLUNG OUT OF THE WINDOW
8312-279791-0053 THIS FAMILY LIKENESS MAY BE TRACED IN THE FAIRY TALES OF ALL COUNTRIES I MERELY REFER TO IT TO SHOW THAT THE REPETITION OF INCIDENTS WAS NOT UNOBSERVED OR UNINTENTIONAL
8324-286681-0000 TWO LITTLE CRAYFISHES QUARREL THE DAY AFTER THE EELS LEFT THE POND PEOPLE TALKED OF NOTHING ELSE IT WAS NOT THAT THEY WERE SO MUCH MISSED FOR THE EELS YOU KNOW DO NOT SWIM AROUND IN THE DAYTIME
8324-286681-0001 THE LARGER PEOPLE HAD BEEN SORRY TO HAVE THEM GO AND SOME OF THEM FELT THAT WITHOUT THE EELS AWAKE AND STIRRING THE POND WAS HARDLY A SAFE PLACE AT NIGHT I THINK IT IS A GOOD DEAL SAFER REMARKED A MINNOW WHO USUALLY SAID WHAT SHE THOUGHT
8324-286681-0002 OF COURSE I DO NOT KNOW WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK THEM SAID A STICKLEBACK WHY REPLIED THE MINNOW IF I HAD GONE TO THE EELS AND ASKED THEM THAT
8324-286681-0003 I HAVE HEARD SOME QUEER THINGS ABOUT THE EELS MYSELF SAID THE STICKLEBACK BUT I HAVE NEVER FELT MUCH AFRAID OF THEM I SUPPOSE I AM BRAVER BECAUSE I WEAR SO MANY OF MY BONES ON THE OUTSIDE JUST THEN
8324-286681-0004 A WISE OLD CRAYFISH CAME ALONG WALKING SIDEWISE
8324-286681-0005 THE CRAYFISH STUCK HIS TAIL INTO THE MUD HE OFTEN DID THIS WHEN HE WAS SURPRISED IT SEEMED TO HELP HIM THINK WHEN HE HAD THOUGHT FOR A WHILE HE WAVED HIS BIG PINCHING CLAWS AND SAID
8324-286681-0006 IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR ME NOT TO TELL WHAT I THINK I USED TO LIVE NEAR THEM THIS SHOWED THAT THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH HAD BEEN WELL BROUGHT UP AND KNEW HE SHOULD NOT SAY UNPLEASANT THINGS ABOUT PEOPLE IF HE COULD HELP IT
8324-286681-0007 WHEN THERE WAS NEED OF IT HE COULD TELL UNPLEASANT TRUTHS AND INDEED THAT VERY EVENING HE DID SAY WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE EELS THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS TEACHING SOME YOUNG CRAYFISHES HIS PUPILS
8324-286681-0008 THEIR MOTHER HAD BROUGHT UP A LARGE FAMILY AND WAS NOT STRONG SHE HAD JUST CAST THE SHELL WHICH SHE HAD WORN FOR A YEAR AND NOW SHE WAS WEAK AND HELPLESS UNTIL THE NEW ONE SHOULD HARDEN ON HER IT IS SUCH A BOTHER SHE SAID
8324-286681-0009 BUT IT IS A COMFORT TO THINK THAT THE NEW ONE WILL LAST A YEAR WHEN I DO GET IT WHILE THEIR MOTHER WAS SO WEAK THE WISE OLD CRAYFISH AMUSED THE CHILDREN AND TAUGHT THEM THINGS WHICH ALL CRAYFISHES SHOULD KNOW EVERY EVENING
8324-286681-0010 THEY GATHERED AROUND HIM SOME OF THEM SWIMMING TO HIM SOME WALKING FORWARD SOME SIDEWISE AND SOME BACKWARD IT MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO THEM WHICH WAY THEY CAME THEY WERE RESTLESS PUPILS AND THEIR TEACHER COULD NOT KEEP THEM FROM LOOKING BEHIND THEM
8324-286681-0011 EACH ONE HAD SO MANY EYES THAT HE COULD LOOK AT THE TEACHER WITH A FEW AND AT THE OTHER LITTLE CRAYFISHES WITH A FEW MORE AND STILL HAVE A GOOD MANY EYES LEFT WITH WHICH TO WATCH THE TADPOLES THESE EYES WERE ARRANGED IN TWO BIG BUNCHES
8324-286681-0012 AND UNLESS YOU LOOKED VERY CLOSELY YOU MIGHT THINK THAT THEY HAD ONLY TWO EYES APIECE THEY HAD GOOD EARS AND THERE WERE ALSO FINE SMELLING BRISTLES GROWING FROM THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0013 THAT HE HAD NOT SLEPT SO MUCH AS USUAL AND NOW WHEN HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN WIDE AWAKE HE FELT EXCEEDINGLY DULL AND STUPID WHEN HE TRIED TO WALK HIS EIGHT LEGS STUMBLED OVER EACH OTHER
8324-286681-0014 AND THE WEAK WAY IN WHICH HE WAVED HIS PINCHING CLAW LEGS SHOWED HOW TIRED HE WAS AFTER HE HAD TOLD HIS PUPILS THE BEST WAY TO HOLD THEIR FOOD WITH THEIR PINCHING CLAWS
8324-286681-0015 ONE MISCHIEVOUS LITTLE FELLOW CALLED OUT I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE EELS MY MOTHER WOULD NEVER LET ME GO NEAR THEM AND NOW THEY'VE MOVED AWAY AND I WON'T EVER SEE THEM AND I THINK IT'S JUST HORRID EELS MY CHILDREN SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0016 ARE LONG SLENDER SHARP NOSED SLIPPERY PEOPLE WITH A FRINGE OF FINS ALONG THEIR BACKS AND ANOTHER FRINGE ALONG THEIR BELLIES THEY BREATHE THROUGH VERY SMALL GILL OPENINGS IN THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS
8324-286681-0017 THEY HAVE LARGE MOUTHS AND TEETH IN THEIR MOUTHS AND THEY ARE ALWAYS STICKING OUT THEIR LOWER JAWS AND HOW DO BEGAN THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH ASK ME THAT TO MORROW SAID THEIR TEACHER
8324-286681-0018 STRETCHING HIS EIGHT WALKING LEGS AND HIS TWO PINCHING CLAW LEGS AND HIS TAIL PADDLES BUT REMEMBER THIS ONE THING IF YOU EVER SEE AN EEL GET OUT OF HIS WAY DON'T STOP
8324-286681-0019 SAID ONE LITTLE CRAYFISH WHO THOUGHT IT SMART TO BE SAUCY WE'LL LOOK
8324-286681-0020 ALL OF WHICH MEANT NOTHING AT ALL AND WAS ONLY SAID TO ANNOY HIS TEACHER THEY SCRAMBLED AWAY OVER THE POND BOTTOM
8324-286681-0021 JIGGLING THE YOUNG CLAMS AND RACING WITH EACH OTHER WHERE THE BOTTOM WAS SMOOTH BEAT YOU RUNNING BACKWARD CRIED THE SAUCY CRAYFISH TO THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH AND THEY SCAMPERED ALONG BACKWARD IN THE MOONLIT WATER THERE WAS AN OLD LOG ON THE BOTTOM OF THE POND
8324-286681-0022 AND THEY SAT ON THAT TO REST THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH HAD BEATEN
8324-286681-0023 SAID THE SAUCY ONE POOH SAID THE BIGGEST ONE THAT'S ALL YOU KNOW THEY DON'T RUN ON LAND WELL I GUESS THEY DO REPLIED THE SAUCY ONE
8324-286681-0024 THAT THE EELS HAD COME BACK TO LIVE IN THE OLD POND AGAIN MOTHER EEL OPENED HER BIG MOUTH VERY WIDE ON LAND SHE SAID DECIDEDLY AS SHE SWALLOWED THE BIGGEST LITTLE CRAYFISH EELS WRIGGLE
8324-286682-0000 THE LUCKY MINK DURING THE WARM WEATHER THE MINKS DID NOT COME OFTEN TO THE POND THEN THEY HAD TO STAY NEARER HOME AND CARE FOR THEIR BABIES IN THE WINTER WHEN FOOD WAS NOT SO PLENTIFUL
8324-286682-0001 AND THEIR YOUNGEST CHILDREN WERE OLD ENOUGH TO COME WITH THEM THEY VISITED THERE EVERY DAY IT WAS NOT FAR FROM THEIR HOME THE MINKS LIVED BY A WATERFALL IN THE RIVER AND HAD BURROWS IN THE BANKS
8324-286682-0002 WHERE THE YOUNG MINKS STAYED UNTIL THEY WERE LARGE ENOUGH TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD THEN THE FATHERS AND MOTHERS WERE VERY BUSY FOR IN EACH HOME THERE WERE FOUR OR FIVE OR SIX CHILDREN HUNGRY AND RESTLESS AND NEEDING TO BE TAUGHT MANY THINGS
8324-286682-0003 THEY WERE RELATED TO THE WEASELS WHO LIVED UP BY THE FARMYARD AND HAD THE SAME SLENDER AND ELEGANT BODIES AND SHORT LEGS AS THEY LIKE THE WEASELS THEY SOMETIMES CLIMBED TREES
8324-286682-0004 THEY DID MOST OF THEIR HUNTING IN THE RIVER SWIMMING WITH THEIR BODIES ALMOST ALL UNDER WATER AND DIVING AND TURNING AND TWISTING GRACEFULLY AND QUICKLY WHEN THEY HUNTED ON LAND THEY COULD TELL BY SMELLING JUST WHICH WAY TO GO FOR THEIR FOOD
8324-286682-0005 THE MINKS WERE A VERY DARK BROWN AND SCATTERED THROUGH THEIR CLOSE SOFT FUR WERE LONG SHINING HAIRS OF AN EVEN DARKER SHADE WHICH MADE THEIR COATS VERY BEAUTIFUL INDEED THE FUR WAS DARKER ON THEIR BACKS THAN ON THE UNDER PART OF THEIR BODIES
8324-286682-0006 AND THEIR TAPERING BUSHY TAILS WERE ALMOST BLACK THEIR UNDER JAWS WERE WHITE AND THEY WERE VERY PROUD OF THEM PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY HAD SO LITTLE WHITE FUR THAT THEY THOUGHT SO MUCH OF IT YOU KNOW THAT IS OFTEN THE WAY
8324-286682-0007 WE THINK MOST OF THOSE THINGS WHICH ARE SCARCE OR HARD TO GET THERE WAS ONE OLD MINK BY THE RIVER WHO HAD A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL AND THAT IS SOMETHING WHICH MANY PEOPLE HAVE NEVER SEEN IT IS EVEN MORE UNCOMMON
8324-286682-0008 THAN FOR MINKS TO HAVE WHITE UPPER LIPS AND THAT HAPPENS ONLY ONCE IN A GREAT WHILE THIS MINK WAS A BACHELOR AND NOBODY KNEW WHY SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE WAS WAITING TO FIND A WIFE WITH A WHITE TIP ON HER TAIL
8324-286682-0009 YET THAT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOR HE WAS TOO WISE TO WAIT FOR SOMETHING WHICH MIGHT NEVER HAPPEN HOWEVER IT WAS HE LIVED ALONE AND FISHED AND HUNTED JUST FOR HIMSELF HE COULD DIVE MORE QUICKLY
8324-286682-0010 STAY UNDER WATER LONGER AND HUNT BY SCENT BETTER THAN ANY OTHER MINK ROUND THERE HIS FUR WAS SLEEKER AND MORE SHINING THAN THAT OF HIS FRIENDS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT THE SISTERS OF HIS FRIENDS THOUGHT THAT HE OUGHT TO MARRY
8324-286682-0011 WHEN THE MINKS VISITED TOGETHER SOMEBODY WAS SURE TO SPEAK OF THE BACHELOR'S LUCK THEY SAID THAT WHATEVER HE DID HE WAS ALWAYS LUCKY IT IS ALL BECAUSE OF A WHITE TIP ON HIS TAIL THEY SAID
8324-286682-0012 THAT MAKES HIM LUCKY THE YOUNG MINKS HEARD THEIR FATHERS AND MOTHERS TALKING AND WISHED THAT THEY HAD BEEN BORN WITH WHITE TIPS ON THEIR TAILS SO THAT THEY COULD BE LUCKY TOO ONCE THE BACHELOR HEARD THEM WISHING THIS AND HE SMILED AND SHOWED HIS BEAUTIFUL TEETH
8324-286682-0013 AND TOLD THEM THAT IT WAS NOT THE TIP OF HIS TAIL
8324-286682-0014 AND THE BROTHERS WERE BIGGER THAN THE SISTERS AS MINK BROTHERS ALWAYS ARE ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL THE SAME AGE ONE WAS VERY MUCH LARGER THAN ANY OF THE REST AND SO THEY CALLED HIM BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0015 HE THOUGHT THERE WAS NEVER SUCH A FINE MINK AS THE BACHELOR AND HE USED TO FOLLOW HIM AROUND
8324-286682-0016 HE WISHED TO BE JUST LIKE HIM IN EVERY WAY BUT ONE HE DID NOT WANT TO BE A BACHELOR THE OTHER YOUNG MINKS LAUGHED AT BIG BROTHER AND ASKED HIM IF HE THOUGHT HIS TAIL WOULD TURN WHITE IF HE FOLLOWED THE BACHELOR LONG ENOUGH
8324-286682-0017 BIG BROTHER STOOD IT VERY PATIENTLY FOR A WHILE THEN HE SNARLED AT THEM AND SHOWED HIS TEETH WITHOUT SMILING AND SAID HE WOULD FIGHT ANYBODY WHO SPOKE ANOTHER WORD ABOUT IT MINKS ARE VERY BRAVE AND VERY FIERCE
8324-286682-0018 AND NEVER KNOW WHEN TO STOP IF THEY HAVE BEGUN TO FIGHT SO AFTER THAT NOBODY DARED TEASE BIG BROTHER BY SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THE BACHELOR SOMETIMES THEY DID LOOK AT HIS TAIL AND SMILE BUT THEY NEVER SPOKE
8324-286682-0019 AND HE PRETENDED NOT TO KNOW WHAT THEY MEANT BY IT A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS THE BACHELOR WAS CAUGHT IN A TRAP A COMMON CLUMSY WOODEN TRAP PUT TOGETHER WITH NAILS AND TWINE
8324-286682-0020 IT WAS NOT NEAR THE RIVER AND NONE OF HIS FRIENDS WOULD HAVE FOUND HIM IF BIG BROTHER HAD NOT HAPPENED ALONG HE COULD HARDLY BELIEVE WHAT HE SAW WAS IT POSSIBLE THAT A TRAP HAD DARED TO CATCH A MINK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286682-0021 THEN HE HEARD THE BACHELOR GROAN AND HE KNEW THAT IT WAS SO HE HURRIED UP TO WHERE THE TRAP WAS CAN'T YOU GET OUT SAID HE NO SAID THE BACHELOR I CAN'T THE BEST WAY TO GET
8324-286682-0022 OUT IS NOT TO GET IN AND I'VE GOTTEN IN CAN'T YOU DO SOMETHING WITH YOUR LUCKY TAIL TO MAKE THE TRAP OPEN ASKED BIG BROTHER I COULD DO SOMETHING WITH MY TEETH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR IF THEY WERE ONLY WHERE THE TIP OF MY TAIL IS
8324-286682-0023 WHY ARE MINKS ALWAYS WALKING INTO TRAPS HE WAS TRYING HARD NOT TO BE CROSS BUT HIS EYES SHOWED HOW HE FELT AND THAT WAS VERY CROSS INDEED THEN BIG BROTHER BECAME MUCH EXCITED
8324-286682-0024 I HAVE GOOD TEETH SAID HE TELL ME WHAT TO DO IF YOU WILL HELP ME OUT SAID THE BACHELOR I WILL GIVE YOU MY LUCK AND WHAT SHALL I DO WITH THE TAIL I HAVE ASKED THE YOUNG MINK
8324-286682-0025 WHO THOUGHT THAT THE BACHELOR WAS TO GIVE HIM HIS WHITE TIPPED TAIL NEVER MIND NOW ANSWERED THE BACHELOR AND HE TOLD THE YOUNG MINK JUST WHERE TO GNAW FOR A LONG TIME THERE WAS NO SOUND BUT THAT OF THE YOUNG MINK'S TEETH ON THE WOOD OF THE TRAP
8324-286682-0026 THE BACHELOR WAS TOO BRAVE TO GROAN OR MAKE A FUSS WHEN HE KNEW THERE WAS ANYBODY AROUND TO HEAR BIG BROTHER'S MOUTH BECAME VERY SORE AND HIS STOMACH BECAME VERY EMPTY BUT STILL HE KEPT AT WORK HE WAS AFRAID SOMEBODY WOULD
8324-286682-0027 COME FOR THE TRAP AND THE MINK IN IT BEFORE HE FINISHED NOW TRY IT SAID HE AFTER HE HAD GNAWED FOR QUITE A WHILE THE BACHELOR BACKED OUT AS FAR AS HE COULD BUT HIS BODY STUCK IN THE HOLE
8324-286682-0028 YOU ARE RUMPLING YOUR BEAUTIFUL FUR CRIED THE YOUNG MINK NEVER MIND THE FUR ANSWERED THE BACHELOR I CAN SMOOTH THAT DOWN AFTERWARD YOU WILL HAVE TO GNAW A LITTLE ON THIS SIDE
8324-286682-0029 AND HE RAISED ONE OF HIS HIND FEET TO SHOW WHERE HE MEANT IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL HINDFOOT THICKLY PADDED AND WITH SHORT PARTLY WEBBED TOES AND NO HAIR AT ALL GROWING BETWEEN THEM THE CLAWS WERE SHORT SHARP AND CURVED
8324-286682-0030 BIG BROTHER GNAWED AWAY NOW TRY IT SAID HE THE BACHELOR BACKED CAREFULLY OUT THROUGH THE OPENING AND STOOD THERE LOOKING TIRED AND HUNGRY AND VERY MUCH RUMPLED YOU ARE A FINE YOUNG MINK SAID HE
8324-286682-0031 WE WILL GET SOMETHING TO EAT AND THEN WE WILL SEE ABOUT MAKING YOU LUCKY THEY WENT TO THE RIVER BANK AND HAD A GOOD DINNER THE BACHELOR ATE MORE THAN BIG BROTHER FOR HIS MOUTH WAS NOT SORE BUT BIG BROTHER WAS VERY HAPPY
8324-286682-0032 HE THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME HE WOULD LOOK WITH A WHITE TIPPED TAIL AND HOW AFTER HE HAD THAT HE COULD SURELY MARRY WHOEVER HE WISHED IT WAS THE CUSTOM AMONG HIS PEOPLE TO WANT TO MARRY THE BEST LOOKING AND STRONGEST
8324-286682-0033 INDEED IT IS SO AMONG ALL THE POND PEOPLE AND THAT IS ONE REASON WHY THEY CARE SO MUCH ABOUT BEING GOOD LOOKING IT IS VERY HARD FOR A YOUNG MINK TO HAVE THE ONE HE LOVES CHOOSE SOMEBODY ELSE JUST BECAUSE THE OTHER FELLOW
8324-286682-0034 HAS THE BUSHIEST TAIL OR THE LONGEST FUR OR THE THICKEST PADS ON HIS FEET NOW SAID THE BACHELOR WE WILL TALK ABOUT LUCK WE WILL GO TO A PLACE WHERE NOBODY CAN HEAR WHAT WE SAY
8324-286682-0035 THEY FOUND SUCH A PLACE AND LAY DOWN THE BACHELOR ROLLED OVER THREE TIMES AND SMOOTHED HIS FUR HE WAS STILL SO TIRED FROM BEING IN THE TRAP THEN HE LOOKED AT THE YOUNG MINK VERY SHARPLY SO YOU WANT MY TAIL
8324-286682-0036 SAID HE YOU SAID YOU WOULD GIVE ME YOUR LUCK ANSWERED BIG BROTHER AND EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT YOUR LUCK IS IN YOUR TAIL THE BACHELOR SMILED WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH THE TAIL YOU HAVE SAID HE
8324-286682-0037 I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED BIG BROTHER YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO WEAR TWO ASKED THE BACHELOR OH NO ANSWERED BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0038 WELL HOW WILL YOU PUT MY TAIL IN PLACE OF YOURS ASKED THE BACHELOR I DON'T KNOW ANSWERED THE YOUNG MINK BUT YOU ARE SO WISE THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT KNOW SOME WAY
8324-286682-0039 HE BEGAN TO FEEL DISCOURAGED AND TO THINK THAT THE BACHELOR'S OFFER DIDN'T MEAN VERY MUCH AFTER ALL DON'T YOU THINK SAID THE BACHELOR SLOWLY DON'T YOU THINK THAT IF YOU COULD HAVE MY LUCK
8324-286682-0040 YOU COULD GET ALONG PRETTY WELL WITH YOUR OWN TAIL WHY YES SAID THE YOUNG MINK WHO HAD BEGUN TO FEAR HE WAS NOT GOING TO GET ANYTHING YES BUT HOW COULD THAT BE
8324-286682-0041 THE BACHELOR SMILED AGAIN I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE SAID HE THAT MY LUCK IS NOT IN MY TAIL AND THEY NEVER BELIEVE IT I WILL TELL YOU THE SECRET OF MY LUCK
8324-286682-0042 AND YOU CAN HAVE LUCK LIKE IT IF YOU REALLY CARE ENOUGH HE LOOKED ALL AROUND TO MAKE SURE THAT NOBODY WAS NEAR AND HE LISTENED VERY CAREFULLY WITH THE TWO LITTLE ROUND EARS THAT WERE ALMOST HIDDEN IN HIS HEAD FUR THEN HE WHISPERED TO BIG BROTHER
8324-286682-0043 THIS IS THE SECRET ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING A LITTLE BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE CAN IS THAT ALL
8324-286682-0044 THAT IS ENOUGH ANSWERED THE BACHELOR KEEP TRYING AND TRYING AND TRYING UNTIL YOU CAN DIVE DEEPER STAY UNDER WATER LONGER RUN FASTER
8324-286682-0045 THEN YOU WILL HAVE GOOD LUCK WHEN THEIRS IS POOR YOU WILL HAVE PLENTY TO EAT WHEN THEY ARE HUNGRY YOU CAN BEAT IN EVERY FIGHT YOU CAN HAVE SLEEK SHINING FUR
8324-286682-0046 SAID HE WHEN I HAVE LEARNED TO DO EVERYTHING IN THE VERY BEST WAY IT WILL BE LUCK OF MY OWN OF COURSE ANSWERED THE BACHELOR
8324-286682-0047 THEN IT IS A KIND OF LUCK THAT CANNOT BE LOST IF I CARRIED MINE IN THE TIP OF MY TAIL SOMEBODY MIGHT BITE IT OFF AND LEAVE ME UNLUCKY BIG BROTHER KEPT THE SECRET
8324-286682-0048 AND WORKED UNTIL HE HAD LEARNED TO BE AS LUCKY AS THE BACHELOR THEN HE MARRIED THE PERSON HE WANTED AND SHE WAS VERY VERY HANDSOME IT IS SAID THAT ONE OF THEIR SONS HAS A WHITE TIPPED TAIL
8324-286683-0000 ONE WARM DAY IN WINTER WHEN SOME OF THE PUSSY WILLOWS MADE A MISTAKE AND BEGAN TO GROW BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT SPRING HAD COME A PARTY OF MUSKRATS WERE VISITING IN THE MARSH BESIDE THE POND ALL AROUND THEM WERE THEIR WINTER HOUSES BUILT OF MUD AND COARSE GRASSES
8324-286683-0001 THESE HOMES LOOKED LIKE HEAPS OF DRIED RUSHES UNLESS ONE WENT CLOSE TO THEM IF ONE DID THAT HE COULD PLAINLY SEE WHAT THEY WERE AND IF ONE HAPPENED TO BE A MUSKRAT AND COULD DIVE AND GO INTO THEM THROUGH THEIR WATERY DOORWAYS
8324-286683-0002 AND ARE AWAKE AT NIGHT WE WISH IT WOULD ALWAYS BE WARM WEATHER SAID THE YOUNG MUSKRATS WHAT'S THE USE OF WINTER HARD TO TELL ANSWERED ONE MUSKRAT
8324-286683-0003 WHO HAD LIVED IN THE MARSH LONGER THAN THE REST HARD TO TELL I KNOW IT ALWAYS GIVES ME A GOOD APPETITE THOUGH THEN ALL THE MUSKRATS LAUGHED THEY WERE A JOLLY GOOD NATURED COMPANY AND EASY TO GET ALONG WITH
8324-286683-0004 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE LIKED THEM MUCH BETTER THAN THEY DID THEIR NEIGHBORS THE MINKS THE WILD DUCKS WHO NESTED IN THE SEDGES WERE QUITE WILLING THAT THE YOUNG MUSKRATS SHOULD PLAY WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND THE MUD HENS WERE NOT AFRAID OF THEM
8324-286683-0005 MUD HENS CANNOT BEAR MINKS THEY SAY THAT WHEN A MUD CHICKEN IS MISSING FROM THE NEST
8324-286683-0006 IN SPRING AND SUMMER WHEN THEY CAN FIND FRESH GRASSES AND YOUNG RUSHES OR A FEW PARSNIPS CARROTS AND TURNIPS FROM THE FARMERS FIELDS OTHER ANIMALS ARE QUITE SAFE IN THE WINTER THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON ROOTS
8324-286683-0007 YES GREAT PITY CHUCKLED THE OLD MUSKRAT HOW GLAD YOU WOULD BE TO SEE THEM HE SMILED ALL AROUND HIS LITTLE MOUTH AND SHOWED HIS GNAWING TEETH
8324-286683-0008 HE KNEW THAT THE FROGS WERE BETTER OFF ASLEEP IN THE MUD AT THE BOTTOM OF THE POND THAN THEY WOULD BE SITTING IN THE SUNSHINE WITH A FEW HUNGRY GULLS ABOVE THEM THE TURTLES WERE SLEEPING ALL WINTER TOO
8324-286683-0009 THE EELS WERE LYING AT THE BOTTOM STUPID AND DROWSY AND SOMEWHERE THE WATER ADDERS WERE HIDDEN AWAY DREAMING OF SPRING OF ALL THE BIRDS WHO LIVED BY THE WATER ONLY THE GULLS WERE THERE AND THEY WERE NOT POPULAR
8324-286683-0010 IT IS TRUE THAT THEY HELPED KEEP THE POND SWEET AND CLEAN AND PICKED UP AND CARRIED AWAY MANY THINGS WHICH MADE THE SHORE UNTIDY STILL THEY WERE RUDE AND TALKED TOO LOUDLY AND WORE THEIR FEATHERS IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY LOOKED LIKE FINE LARGE BIRDS
8324-286683-0011 THE OTHER POND PEOPLE SAID THAT WAS JUST LIKE THEM ALWAYS PRETENDING TO BE MORE THAN THEY REALLY WERE FIFTEEN YOUNG MUSKRATS ALL BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL BORN THE SUMMER BEFORE STARTED OFF TO LOOK AT THE OLD HOME
8324-286683-0012 WHERE THEY WERE CHILDREN TOGETHER THAT IS TO SAY
8324-286683-0013 AND WHEN THEY WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LOOK OUT FOR THEMSELVES FIVE MORE CAME TO LIVE IN THE OLD NEST AND WHEN THESE WERE OLD ENOUGH TO LEAVE THE NEST ANOTHER FIVE WERE BORN IT DOESN'T MEAN SO MUCH TO MUSKRATS TO BE BROTHERS AND SISTERS AS IT DOES TO SOME PEOPLE
8324-286683-0014 AND TO HEAR THEM SLAP THEIR LONG SCALY TAILS ON THE WATER WHEN THEY DOVE THEY HAD SHORT DOWNY FUR ALMOST BLACK ON THE BACK SOFT GRAY UNDERNEATH AND A REDDISH BROWN EVERYWHERE ELSE
8324-286683-0015 THERE WAS VERY LITTLE FUR ON THEIR TAILS OR ON THEIR FEET AND THOSE PARTS WERE BLACK THESE FIFTEEN CHILDREN HAD BEEN FAIRLY WELL BROUGHT UP BUT YOU CAN SEE THAT THEIR MOTHER HAD MANY CARES
8324-286683-0016 SO IT IS NOT STRANGE IF THEY SOMETIMES BEHAVED BADLY IN SOME OTHER FAMILIES WHERE THERE WERE ONLY NINE OR TEN BABIES ALL THE SEASON THEY HAD BEEN BROUGHT UP MORE STRICTLY
8324-286683-0017 LIKE ALL YOUNG MUSKRATS THEY WERE FULL OF FUN AND THERE WERE FEW PLEASANTER SIGHTS THAN TO SEE THEM FROLICKING ON A WARM MOONLIGHT EVENING WHEN THEY LOOKED LIKE BROWN BALLS ROLLING AND BOUNDING AROUND ON THE SHORE OR PLUNGING INTO THE WATER
8324-286683-0018 IF THEY HAD ALL BEEN EXACTLY THE SAME AGE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN PLEASANTER FOR THE OLDEST FIVE WOULD PUT ON AIRS AND CALL THE OTHERS THE CHILDREN AND THE NEXT FIVE WOULD CALL THE YOUNGEST FIVE
8324-286683-0019 BABIES ALTHOUGH THEY WERE ALL WELL GROWN THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR THE YOUNGEST FIVE TO CALL OTHER MUSKRATS BABIES SO WHEN THEY WERE WARM AND WELL FED AND GOOD NATURED THEY LAUGHED AND SAID WHO CARES
8324-286683-0020 WHEN THEY WERE COLD AND HUNGRY THEY SLAPPED THEIR TAILS ON THE GROUND OR ON THE WATER AND SAID DON'T YOU THINK YOU'RE SMART
8324-286683-0021 SHE WOULD SAY NOW CHILDREN IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY HAD TO STOP
8324-286683-0022 TEASING IS NOT SO VERY BAD YOU KNOW ALTHOUGH IT IS DREADFULLY SILLY BUT WHEN PEOPLE BEGIN BY TEASING THEY SOMETIMES GET TO SAYING THINGS IN EARNEST EVEN REALLY HATEFUL MEAN THINGS
8324-286683-0023 AND THAT WAS WHAT MADE THE MUSKRAT FATHER AND MOTHER STOP IT WHENEVER THEY COULD NOW THE WHOLE FIFTEEN CROWDED AROUND THE OLD SUMMER HOME AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ONE WAY AND SOME OF THEM WENT IN ANOTHER
8324-286683-0024 FOR EVERY MUSKRAT'S SUMMER HOUSE HAS SEVERAL BURROWS LEADING TO IT WHEN THEY REACHED THE OLD NEST AT THE END ALL OF THEM TRIED TO GET IN AT ONCE AND THEY PUSHED EACH OTHER AROUND WITH THEIR BROAD LITTLE HEADS
8324-286683-0025 SCRAMBLED AND CLUTCHED AND HELD ON WITH THEIR STRONG LITTLE FEET FIVE OF THEM SAID IT'S OUR TURN FIRST WE'RE THE OLDEST AND FIVE MORE SAID WELL IT'S OUR TURN NEXT ANYWAY CAUSE WE'RE NEXT OLDEST
8324-286683-0026 THE OTHERS SAID YOU MIGHT GIVE UP TO US BECAUSE WE'RE THE YOUNGEST THEY PUSHED AND SCRAMBLED SOME MORE AND ONE OF THE YOUNGEST CHILDREN SAID TO ONE OF THE OLDEST WELL I DON'T CARE I'M JUST AS BIG AS YOU ARE
8324-286683-0027 WHICH WAS SO AND THE OLDER ONE ANSWERED BACK WELL YOU'RE NOT SO GOOD LOOKING WHICH WAS ALSO TRUE THEN PART OF THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8324-286683-0028 TOOK SIDES WITH ONE AND PART TOOK SIDES WITH THE OTHER WHAT HAD BEEN A LOVELY FROLIC BECAME AN UNPLEASANT DISGRACEFUL QUARREL AND THEY SAID SUCH THINGS AS THESE
8324-286683-0029 YOU SLAPPED YOUR TAIL ON MY BACK
8324-286683-0030 OR THE HALF WAY BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHOULD GO FIRST INTO THE OLD NEST AND IT DIDN'T MATTER A BIT WHO WAS OLDEST OR WHO WAS YOUNGEST AND IT NEVER WOULD HAVE HAPPENED HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THEIR DREADFUL HABIT OF TEASING
8324-286683-0031 BUT THEY WERE TOO MUCH EXCITED TO MIND AND THEY DID NOT STOP UNTIL THEIR FATHER CAME AND SLAPPED THEM WITH HIS TAIL THEN THEY KEPT STILL AND LISTENED TO THEIR MOTHER
8324-286683-0032 SHE TOLD THEM THAT THEY SHOULD LEAVE THE PLACE AT ONCE AND NOT ONE OF THEM SHOULD EVEN SET FOOT IN THE OLD NEST SUPPOSE SOMEBODY HAD GOTTEN HURT SHE SAID THIS MADE THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOK VERY SOBER
8324-286683-0033 FOR THEY KNEW THAT THE MUSKRAT WHO IS HURT IN WINTER NEVER GETS WELL AFTER SHE HAD LET THEM THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A WHILE SHE SAID I SHALL PUNISH YOU ALL FOR THIS
8324-286683-0034 THEN THERE WAS NO QUARREL AMONG HER CHILDREN TO SEE WHO SHOULD HAVE THE FIRST TURN NOT AT ALL ONE YOUNG MUSKRAT SAID AREN'T YOU GOING TO LET US PLAY ANY MORE YES
8324-286683-0035 BUT I SHALL CHOOSE THE GAMES THE OLDEST FIVE WILL PLAY MUD TURTLES IN WINTER THE NEXT FIVE WILL PLAY FROGS IN WINTER AND THE YOUNGEST FIVE WILL PLAY SNAKES IN WINTER
8324-286683-0036 THE WAY TO PLAY THESE GAMES IS TO LIE PERFECTLY STILL IN SOME DARK PLACE AND NOT SAY A WORD THE YOUNG MUSKRATS LOOKED AT EACH OTHER SORROWFULLY
8324-286683-0037 THEY THOUGHT IT SOUNDED VERY MUCH THE SAME AS BEING SENT TO BED FOR BEING NAUGHTY THEY DID NOT DARE SAY ANYTHING FOR THEY KNEW THAT ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER WAS GENTLE AS MUSKRATS ARE MOST OF THE TIME SHE COULD BE VERY SEVERE
8324-286683-0038 SO THEY WENT AWAY QUIETLY TO PLAY WHAT SHE HAD TOLD THEM THEY MUST BUT IT WAS NOT MUCH FUN TO PLAY THOSE GAMES WHEN ALL THE OTHERS WERE HAVING A FINE TIME IN THE SUNSHINE
839-130898-0000 IN LATITUDE FORTY SEVEN DEGREES
839-130898-0001 AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
839-130898-0002 IN THE AFTERMATH OF THIS STORM WE WERE THROWN BACK TO THE EAST AWAY WENT ANY HOPE OF ESCAPING TO THE LANDING PLACES OF NEW YORK OR THE SAINT LAWRENCE IN DESPAIR
839-130898-0003 POOR NED WENT INTO SECLUSION LIKE CAPTAIN NEMO CONSEIL AND I NO LONGER LEFT EACH OTHER AS I SAID THE NAUTILUS VEERED TO THE EAST TO BE MORE ACCURATE I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO THE NORTHEAST
839-130898-0004 SOMETIMES BENEATH THEM THE SHIP WANDERED FOR DAYS AMID THESE MISTS SO FEARED BY NAVIGATORS THESE ARE CAUSED CHIEFLY BY MELTING ICE WHICH KEEPS THE AIR EXTREMELY DAMP
839-130898-0005 HOW MANY SHIPS HAVE PERISHED IN THESE WATERWAYS AS THEY TRIED TO GET DIRECTIONS FROM THE HAZY LIGHTS ON THE COAST HOW MANY CASUALTIES HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THESE OPAQUE MISTS HOW MANY COLLISIONS HAVE OCCURRED WITH THESE REEFS
839-130898-0006 WHERE THE BREAKING SURF IS COVERED BY THE NOISE OF THE WIND HOW MANY VESSELS HAVE RAMMED EACH OTHER
839-130898-0007 SO THE FLOOR OF THIS SEA HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BATTLEFIELD WHERE EVERY SHIP DEFEATED
839-130898-0008 OTHERS NEWER AND REFLECTING OUR BEACON LIGHT ON THEIR IRONWORK AND COPPER UNDERSIDES AMONG THESE VESSELS HOW MANY WENT DOWN WITH ALL HANDS WITH THEIR CREWS AND HOSTS OF IMMIGRANTS
839-130898-0009 AT THESE TROUBLE SPOTS SO PROMINENT IN THE STATISTICS CAPE RACE SAINT PAUL ISLAND THE STRAIT OF BELLE ISLE THE SAINT LAWRENCE ESTUARY
839-130898-0010 AND IN ONLY A FEW YEARS HOW MANY VICTIMS HAVE BEEN FURNISHED TO THE OBITUARY NOTICES BY THE ROYAL MAIL INMAN AND MONTREAL LINES BY VESSELS NAMED THE SOLWAY THE ISIS THE PARAMATTA
839-130898-0011 THE HUNGARIAN THE CANADIAN THE ANGLO SAXON THE HUMBOLDT
839-130898-0012 ALL RUN AGROUND BY THE ARCTIC AND THE LYONNAIS SUNK IN COLLISIONS BY THE PRESIDENT THE PACIFIC AND THE CITY OF GLASGOW
839-130898-0013 OF THEIR GLOOMY RUBBLE THE NAUTILUS NAVIGATED
839-130898-0014 BY MAY FIFTEENTH WE WERE OFF THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE GRAND BANKS OF NEWFOUNDLAND THESE BANKS ARE THE RESULT OF MARINE SEDIMENTATION AN EXTENSIVE ACCUMULATION OF ORGANIC WASTE
839-130898-0015 BROUGHT EITHER FROM THE EQUATOR BY THE GULF STREAM'S CURRENT OR FROM THE NORTH POLE BY THE COUNTERCURRENT OF COLD WATER THAT SKIRTS THE AMERICAN COAST HERE TOO ERRATICALLY DRIFTING CHUNKS COLLECT FROM THE ICE BREAKUP
839-130898-0016 HERE A HUGE BONEYARD FORMS FROM FISH MOLLUSKS
839-130898-0017 DYING OVER IT BY THE BILLIONS THE SEA IS OF NO GREAT DEPTH AT THE GRAND BANKS A FEW HUNDRED FATHOMS AT BEST BUT TO THE SOUTH THERE IS A DEEP
839-130898-0018 SUDDENLY OCCURRING DEPRESSION A THREE THOUSAND METER PIT HERE THE GULF STREAM WIDENS
839-130898-0019 A ONE METER LUMPFISH BLACKISH ON TOP
839-130898-0020 AND RARE AMONG ITS BRETHREN IN THAT IT PRACTICES MONOGAMY A GOOD SIZED EELPOUT A TYPE OF EMERALD MORAY WHOSE FLAVOR IS EXCELLENT WOLFFISH WITH BIG EYES
839-130898-0021 VIVIPAROUS BLENNIES WHOSE EGGS HATCH INSIDE THEIR BODIES LIKE THOSE OF SNAKES BLOATED GOBIO
839-130898-0022 MEASURING TWO DECIMETERS GRENADIERS WITH LONG TAILS AND GLEAMING WITH A SILVERY GLOW SPEEDY FISH VENTURING FAR FROM THEIR HIGH ARCTIC SEAS OUR NETS ALSO HAULED IN A BOLD
839-130898-0023 DARING VIGOROUS AND MUSCULAR FISH ARMED WITH PRICKLES ON ITS HEAD AND STINGS ON ITS FINS A REAL SCORPION MEASURING TWO TO THREE METERS THE RUTHLESS ENEMY
839-130898-0024 BLENNIES AND SALMON IT WAS THE BULLHEAD OF THE NORTHERLY SEAS A FISH WITH RED FINS AND A BROWN BODY COVERED WITH NODULES
839-130898-0025 THE NAUTILUS'S FISHERMEN HAD SOME TROUBLE GETTING A GRIP ON THIS ANIMAL WHICH THANKS TO THE FORMATION OF ITS GILL COVERS
839-130898-0026 CAN PROTECT ITS RESPIRATORY ORGANS FROM ANY PARCHING CONTACT WITH THE AIR AND CAN LIVE OUT OF WATER FOR A GOOD WHILE AND I'LL MENTION FOR THE RECORD SOME LITTLE BANDED BLENNIES
839-130898-0027 THAT FOLLOW SHIPS INTO THE NORTHERNMOST SEAS SHARP SNOUTED CARP EXCLUSIVE TO THE NORTH ATLANTIC SCORPIONFISH AND LASTLY
839-130898-0028 CHIEFLY THE COD SPECIES WHICH I DETECTED IN THEIR WATERS OF CHOICE OVER THESE INEXHAUSTIBLE GRAND BANKS BECAUSE NEWFOUNDLAND IS SIMPLY AN UNDERWATER PEAK
839-130898-0029 YOU COULD CALL THESE COD MOUNTAIN FISH WHILE THE NAUTILUS WAS CLEARING A PATH THROUGH THEIR TIGHT RANKS
839-130898-0030 MERCY LOOK AT THESE COD HE SAID WHY I THOUGHT COD WERE FLAT LIKE DAB OR SOLE
839-130898-0031 AND SPREAD OUT ON DISPLAY BUT IN THE WATER THEY'RE LIKE MULLET SPINDLE SHAPED AND PERFECTLY BUILT FOR SPEED I CAN EASILY BELIEVE MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHAT CROWDS OF THEM WHAT SWARMS
839-130898-0032 BAH MY FRIEND THERE'D BE MANY MORE WITHOUT THEIR ENEMIES SCORPIONFISH AND HUMAN BEINGS DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY EGGS HAVE BEEN COUNTED IN A SINGLE FEMALE I'LL GO ALL OUT CONSEIL REPLIED
839-130898-0033 FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELEVEN MILLION MY FRIEND ELEVEN MILLION I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT UNTIL I COUNT THEM MYSELF SO COUNT THEM CONSEIL
839-130898-0034 BUT IT WOULD BE LESS WORK TO BELIEVE ME BESIDES FRENCHMEN ENGLISHMEN AMERICANS DANES AND NORWEGIANS CATCH THESE COD BY THE THOUSANDS THEY'RE EATEN IN PRODIGIOUS QUANTITIES AND WITHOUT
839-130898-0035 THE SEAS WOULD SOON BE DEPOPULATED OF THEM ACCORDINGLY IN ENGLAND AND AMERICA ALONE FIVE THOUSAND SHIPS MANNED BY SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND SEAMEN GO AFTER COD EACH SHIP BRINGS BACK AN AVERAGE CATCH
839-130898-0036 OF FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FISH MAKING TWENTY TWO MILLION OFF THE COAST OF NORWAY
839-130898-0037 THE TOTAL IS THE SAME FINE CONSEIL REPLIED I'LL TAKE MASTER'S WORD FOR IT I WON'T COUNT THEM COUNT WHAT THOSE ELEVEN MILLION EGGS BUT I'LL MAKE ONE COMMENT
839-130898-0038 WHAT'S THAT IF ALL THEIR EGGS HATCHED JUST FOUR CODFISH COULD FEED ENGLAND AMERICA AND NORWAY AS WE SKIMMED THE DEPTHS OF THE GRAND BANKS
839-130898-0039 I COULD SEE PERFECTLY THOSE LONG FISHING LINES EACH ARMED WITH TWO HUNDRED HOOKS THAT EVERY BOAT DANGLED BY THE DOZENS THE LOWER END OF EACH LINE DRAGGED THE BOTTOM BY MEANS OF A SMALL GRAPPLING IRON
839-130898-0040 OF A CORK FLOAT THE NAUTILUS HAD TO MANEUVER SHREWDLY IN THE MIDST OF THIS UNDERWATER SPIDERWEB BUT THE SHIP DIDN'T STAY LONG IN THESE HEAVILY TRAVELED WATERWAYS IT WENT UP TO ABOUT LATITUDE FORTY TWO DEGREES
839-130898-0041 THIS BROUGHT IT ABREAST OF SAINT JOHN'S IN NEWFOUNDLAND AND HEART'S CONTENT WHERE THE ATLANTIC CABLE REACHES ITS END POINT INSTEAD OF CONTINUING NORTH THE NAUTILUS TOOK AN EASTERLY HEADING
839-130898-0042 AS IF TO GO ALONG THIS PLATEAU ON WHICH THE TELEGRAPH CABLE RESTS WHERE MULTIPLE SOUNDINGS HAVE GIVEN THE CONTOURS OF THE TERRAIN WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY IT WAS ON MAY SEVENTEENTH
839-130898-0043 ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILES FROM HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0044 THAT I SPOTTED THIS CABLE LYING ON THE SEAFLOOR CONSEIL WHOM I HADN'T ALERTED MISTOOK IT AT FIRST FOR A GIGANTIC SEA SNAKE AND WAS GEARING UP TO CLASSIFY IT IN HIS BEST MANNER
839-130898-0045 THE FINE LAD AND LET HIM DOWN GENTLY BY GIVING HIM VARIOUS DETAILS ON THE LAYING OF THIS CABLE THE FIRST CABLE WAS PUT DOWN DURING THE YEARS EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN EIGHTEEN FIFTY EIGHT BUT
839-130898-0046 AFTER TRANSMITTING ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TELEGRAMS IT WENT DEAD IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ENGINEERS BUILT A NEW CABLE THAT MEASURED
839-130898-0047 FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED METRIC TONS AND WAS SHIPPED ABOARD THE GREAT EASTERN THIS ATTEMPT ALSO FAILED NOW THEN
839-130898-0048 ON MAY TWENTY FIFTH WHILE SUBMERGED TO A DEPTH OF THREE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY SIX METERS THE NAUTILUS LAY IN PRECISELY THE LOCALITY WHERE THIS SECOND CABLE SUFFERED THE RUPTURE THAT RUINED THE UNDERTAKING
839-130898-0049 THE ELECTRICIANS ON BOARD DECIDED TO CUT THE CABLE BEFORE FISHING IT UP AND BY ELEVEN O'CLOCK THAT EVENING THEY HAD RETRIEVED THE DAMAGED PART THEY REPAIRED THE JOINT AND ITS SPLICE
839-130898-0050 THEN THE CABLE WAS RESUBMERGED BUT A FEW DAYS LATER IT SNAPPED AGAIN AND COULDN'T BE RECOVERED FROM THE OCEAN DEPTHS
839-130898-0051 WHO HAD RISKED HIS WHOLE FORTUNE TO PROMOTE THIS UNDERTAKING CALLED FOR A NEW BOND ISSUE IT SOLD OUT IMMEDIATELY
839-130898-0052 WHICH WAS PROTECTED BY A PADDING OF TEXTILE MATERIAL ENCLOSED IN A METAL SHEATH THE GREAT EASTERN PUT BACK TO SEA ON JULY THIRTEENTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY SIX
839-130898-0053 YET THERE WAS ONE HITCH AS THEY GRADUALLY UNROLLED THIS THIRD CABLE THE ELECTRICIANS OBSERVED ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS THAT SOMEONE HAD RECENTLY DRIVEN NAILS INTO IT TRYING TO DAMAGE ITS CORE
839-130898-0054 CAPTAIN ANDERSON HIS OFFICERS AND THE ENGINEERS PUT THEIR HEADS TOGETHER THEN POSTED A WARNING
839-130898-0055 WITHOUT A TRIAL AFTER THAT THESE VILLAINOUS ATTEMPTS WERE NOT REPEATED BY JULY TWENTY THIRD THE GREAT EASTERN WAS LYING NO FARTHER THAN EIGHT HUNDRED KILOMETERS FROM NEWFOUNDLAND
839-130898-0056 WHEN IT RECEIVED TELEGRAPHED NEWS FROM IRELAND
839-130898-0057 SIGNED BETWEEN PRUSSIA AND AUSTRIA AFTER THE BATTLE OF SADOVA THROUGH THE MISTS ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH IT SIGHTED THE PORT OF HEART'S CONTENT
839-130898-0058 HAD ENDED HAPPILY AND IN ITS FIRST DISPATCH YOUNG AMERICA ADDRESSED OLD EUROPE WITH THESE WISE WORDS SO RARELY UNDERSTOOD GLORY TO GOD IN THE HIGHEST AND PEACE ON EARTH TO MEN OF GOOD WILL
839-130898-0059 I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND THIS ELECTRIC CABLE IN MINT CONDITION AS IT LOOKED ON LEAVING ITS PLACE OF MANUFACTURE THE LONG SNAKE WAS COVERED WITH SEASHELL RUBBLE AND BRISTLING WITH
839-130898-0060 A CRUST OF CAKED GRAVEL PROTECTED IT FROM ANY MOLLUSKS THAT MIGHT BORE INTO IT IT RESTED SERENELY SHELTERED FROM THE SEA'S MOTIONS UNDER A PRESSURE FAVORABLE TO THE TRANSMISSION
839-130898-0061 THAT GOES FROM AMERICA TO EUROPE
839-130898-0062 THIS CABLE WILL NO DOUBT LAST INDEFINITELY BECAUSE AS OBSERVERS NOTE
839-130898-0063 BESIDES ON THIS WELL CHOSEN PLATEAU THE CABLE NEVER LIES AT DEPTHS THAT COULD CAUSE A BREAK THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0064 TO ITS LOWEST REACHES LOCATED FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED THIRTY ONE METERS DOWN
839-130898-0065 THEN WE RETURNED TO THE LOCALITY WHERE THE EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE ACCIDENT HAD TAKEN PLACE THERE THE OCEAN FLOOR FORMED A VALLEY
839-130898-0066 ONE HUNDRED TWENTY KILOMETERS WIDE INTO WHICH YOU COULD FIT MT BLANC WITHOUT ITS SUMMIT POKING ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE WAVES THIS VALLEY IS CLOSED OFF TO THE EAST BY A SHEER WALL
839-130898-0067 TWO THOUSAND METERS HIGH WE ARRIVED THERE ON MAY TWENTY EIGHTH AND THE NAUTILUS
839-130898-0068 HEAD UP NORTH AND BEACH US ON THE BRITISH ISLES NO MUCH TO MY SURPRISE HE WENT BACK DOWN SOUTH AND RETURNED TO EUROPEAN SEAS AS WE SWUNG AROUND THE EMERALD ISLE
839-130898-0069 I SPOTTED CAPE CLEAR FOR AN INSTANT PLUS THE LIGHTHOUSE ON FASTNET ROCK THAT GUIDES ALL THOSE THOUSANDS OF SHIPS SETTING OUT FROM GLASGOW OR LIVERPOOL AN IMPORTANT QUESTION THEN POPPED INTO MY HEAD
839-130898-0070 WOULD THE NAUTILUS DARE TO TACKLE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL NED LAND WHO PROMPTLY REAPPEARED AFTER WE HUGGED SHORE NEVER STOPPED QUESTIONING ME WHAT COULD I ANSWER HIM
839-130898-0071 AFTER GIVING THE CANADIAN A GLIMPSE OF AMERICAN SHORES WAS HE ABOUT TO SHOW ME THE COAST OF FRANCE BUT THE NAUTILUS KEPT GRAVITATING SOUTHWARD ON MAY THIRTIETH
839-130898-0072 IN SIGHT OF LAND'S END IT PASSED BETWEEN THE LOWERMOST TIP OF ENGLAND AND THE SCILLY ISLANDS WHICH IT LEFT BEHIND TO STARBOARD IF IT WAS GOING TO ENTER THE ENGLISH CHANNEL
839-130898-0073 IT CLEARLY NEEDED TO HEAD EAST IT DID NOT ALL DAY LONG ON MAY THIRTY FIRST THE NAUTILUS SWEPT AROUND THE SEA IN A SERIES OF CIRCLES
839-130898-0074 THAT HAD ME DEEPLY PUZZLED IT SEEMED TO BE SEARCHING FOR A LOCALITY THAT IT HAD SOME TROUBLE FINDING AT NOON
839-130898-0075 HE DIDN'T ADDRESS A WORD TO ME HE LOOKED GLOOMIER THAN EVER WHAT WAS FILLING HIM WITH SUCH SADNESS WAS IT OUR PROXIMITY TO THESE EUROPEAN SHORES WAS HE RELIVING HIS MEMORIES OF THAT COUNTRY
839-130898-0076 HE HAD LEFT BEHIND IF SO WHAT DID HE FEEL REMORSE OR REGRET FOR A GOOD WHILE THESE THOUGHTS OCCUPIED MY MIND AND I HAD A HUNCH THAT FATE WOULD SOON GIVE AWAY THE CAPTAIN'S SECRETS
839-130898-0077 THE NEXT DAY JUNE FIRST THE NAUTILUS KEPT TO THE SAME TACK IT WAS OBVIOUSLY TRYING TO LOCATE SOME PRECISE SPOT IN THE OCEAN JUST AS ON THE DAY BEFORE
839-130898-0078 CAPTAIN NEMO CAME TO TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN THE SEA WAS SMOOTH THE SKIES CLEAR EIGHT MILES TO THE EAST A BIG STEAMSHIP WAS VISIBLE ON THE HORIZON LINE NO FLAG
839-130898-0079 WAS FLAPPING FROM THE GAFF OF ITS FORE AND AFT SAIL AND I COULDN'T TELL ITS NATIONALITY A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THE SUN PASSED ITS ZENITH
839-130898-0080 AND TOOK HIS SIGHTS WITH THE UTMOST PRECISION THE ABSOLUTE CALM OF THE WAVES FACILITATED THIS OPERATION THE NAUTILUS LAY MOTIONLESS NEITHER ROLLING NOR PITCHING I WAS ON THE PLATFORM JUST THEN
839-130898-0081 AFTER DETERMINING OUR POSITION THE CAPTAIN PRONOUNCED ONLY THESE WORDS IT'S RIGHT HERE HE WENT DOWN THE HATCH HAD HE SEEN THAT VESSEL CHANGE COURSE
839-130898-0082 AND SEEMINGLY HEAD TOWARD US I'M UNABLE TO SAY I RETURNED TO THE LOUNGE THE HATCH CLOSED AND I HEARD WATER HISSING IN THE BALLAST TANKS THE NAUTILUS BEGAN TO SINK
839-130898-0083 ON A VERTICAL LINE BECAUSE ITS PROPELLER WAS IN CHECK AND NO LONGER FURNISHED ANY FORWARD MOTION SOME MINUTES LATER IT STOPPED AT A DEPTH OF EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY THREE METERS AND CAME TO REST ON THE SEAFLOOR
839-130898-0084 THE CEILING LIGHTS IN THE LOUNGE THEN WENT OUT THE PANELS OPENED AND THROUGH THE WINDOWS I SAW FOR A HALF MILE RADIUS THE SEA BRIGHTLY LIT BY THE BEACON'S RAYS
839-130898-0085 I LOOKED TO PORT AND SAW NOTHING BUT THE IMMENSENESS OF THESE TRANQUIL WATERS TO STARBOARD A PROMINENT BULGE ON THE SEA BOTTOM CAUGHT MY ATTENTION YOU WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
839-130898-0086 IT WAS SOME RUIN ENSHROUDED IN A CRUST OF WHITENED SEASHELLS AS IF UNDER A MANTLE OF SNOW CAREFULLY EXAMINING THIS MASS I COULD IDENTIFY THE SWOLLEN OUTLINES OF A SHIP SHORN
839-130898-0087 OF ITS MASTS WHICH MUST HAVE SUNK BOW FIRST THIS CASUALTY CERTAINLY DATED FROM SOME FAR OFF TIME TO BE SO CAKED WITH THE LIMESTONE OF THESE WATERS
839-130898-0088 THIS WRECKAGE MUST HAVE SPENT MANY A YEAR ON THE OCEAN FLOOR WHAT SHIP WAS THIS WHY HAD THE NAUTILUS COME TO VISIT ITS GRAVE WAS IT SOMETHING OTHER THAN A MARITIME ACCIDENT THAT HAD DRAGGED THIS CRAFT UNDER THE WATERS
839-130898-0089 I WASN'T SURE WHAT TO THINK BUT NEXT TO ME I HEARD CAPTAIN NEMO'S VOICE SLOWLY SAY ORIGINALLY THIS SHIP WAS CHRISTENED
839-130898-0090 IT CARRIED SEVENTY FOUR CANNONS AND WAS LAUNCHED IN SEVENTEEN SIXTY TWO ON AUGUST THIRTEENTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY EIGHT COMMANDED BY LA POYPE VERTRIEUX
839-130898-0091 IT FOUGHT VALIANTLY AGAINST THE PRESTON ON JULY FOURTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY NINE AS A MEMBER OF THE SQUADRON UNDER ADMIRAL D'ESTAING IT ASSISTED IN THE CAPTURE
839-130898-0092 OF THE ISLAND OF GRENADA ON SEPTEMBER FIFTH SEVENTEEN EIGHTY ONE UNDER THE COUNT DE GRASSE IT TOOK PART IN THE BATTLE OF CHESAPEAKE BAY IN SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR
839-130898-0093 THE NEW REPUBLIC OF FRANCE CHANGED THE NAME OF THIS SHIP ON APRIL SIXTEENTH OF THAT SAME YEAR IT JOINED THE SQUADRON AT BREST UNDER REAR ADMIRAL
839-130898-0094 WHO WAS ENTRUSTED WITH ESCORTING A CONVOY OF WHEAT COMING FROM AMERICA UNDER THE COMMAND OF ADMIRAL VAN STABEL IN THIS SECOND YEAR OF THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY CALENDAR
839-130898-0095 THIS SQUADRON FOUGHT AN ENCOUNTER WITH ENGLISH VESSELS SIR TODAY IS JUNE FIRST EIGHTEEN SIXTY EIGHT OR THE THIRTEENTH DAY IN THE MONTH OF PASTURE
839-130898-0096 SEVENTY FOUR YEARS AGO TO THE DAY AT THIS VERY SPOT IN LATITUDE
839-130898-0097 AND LONGITUDE SEVENTEEN DEGREES
839-130898-0098 ITS THREE MASTS GONE WATER IN ITS HOLD A THIRD OF ITS CREW OUT OF ACTION IT PREFERRED TO GO TO THE BOTTOM WITH ITS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY SIX SEAMEN RATHER THAN SURRENDER AND WITH ITS FLAG
839-130898-0099 NAILED UP ON THE AFTERDECK IT DISAPPEARED BENEATH THE WAVES TO SHOUTS OF LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC THIS IS THE AVENGER I EXCLAIMED YES SIR THE AVENGER A SPLENDID NAME
8419-286667-0000 THE DANCE OF THE SAND HILL CRANES ONE FINE DAY IN SPRING A GREAT FLOCK OF SAND HILL CRANES CAME FROM THE SOUTH THEY WERE FLYING HIGH AND QUIETLY BECAUSE THE WEATHER WAS BRIGHT IF IT HAD BEEN STORMY
8419-286667-0001 OR IF THEY HAD BEEN FLYING BY NIGHT AS THEY USUALLY DID THEY WOULD HAVE STAYED NEARER THE GROUND AND THEIR LEADER WOULD HAVE TRUMPETED LOUDLY TO LET HIS FOLLOWERS KNOW WHICH WAY HE WAS GOING THEY WOULD ALSO HAVE TRUMPETED BUT MORE SOFTLY TO TELL HIM THAT THEY WERE COMING AFTER
8419-286667-0002 THEY WERE A FINE COMPANY TO LOOK UPON ORDERLY STRONG AND DIGNIFIED THEIR LONG NECKS WERE STRETCHED OUT STRAIGHT AHEAD THEIR LONG LEGS STRAIGHT BEHIND AND THEY BEAT THE AIR WITH SLOW REGULAR STROKES OF THE STRONG WINGS
8419-286667-0003 AS THEY CAME NEAR THE POND THEY FLEW LOWER AND LOWER UNTIL ALL SWEPT DOWN TO THE EARTH AND ALIGHTED TALL AND STATELY BY THE EDGE OF THE WATER THEY HAD EATEN NOTHING FOR SEVERAL DAYS AND WERE SOON HUNTING FOR FOOD SOME ON LAND
8419-286667-0004 AND SOME IN THE WATER FOR THEY HAD STOPPED TO FEED AND REST THOSE WHO HUNTED IN THE WATER DID SO VERY QUIETLY A CRANE WOULD STAND ON ONE LEG WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST HIS BREAST SO QUIETLY THAT ONE MIGHT THINK HIM ASLEEP BUT AS SOON AS ANYTHING EATABLE CAME NEAR
8419-286667-0005 HE WOULD BEND HIS BODY STRETCH OUT HIS NECK OPEN HIS LONG SLENDER BILL AND SWALLOW IT AT ONE GULP THEN HE WOULD SEEM TO FALL ASLEEP AGAIN WHILE MOST OF THE CRANES WERE STILL FEEDING SOME OF THEM WERE STALKING THROUGH THE WOODS AND LOOKING THIS WAY AND THAT
8419-286667-0006 THEY WERE THOSE WHO THOUGHT OF STAYING THERE FOR THE SUMMER WHEN THE FLOCK AROSE TO FLY ON AGAIN EIGHT CRANES STAYED BEHIND THEY WATCHED THEIR FRIENDS FLY AWAY AND STOOD ON THE GROUND WITH THEIR NECKS AND BILLS UPLIFTED AND MOUTHS OPEN
8419-286667-0007 WHILE THEY TRUMPETED OR CALLED OUT GOOD BYE STOP FOR US IN THE FALL THE FLYING CRANES TRUMPETED BACK WE WILL DON'T FORGET US THAT NIGHT THEY SLEPT NEAR TOGETHER AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN WITH THE LARGE FLOCK
8419-286667-0008 AND ONE CRANE KEPT AWAKE TO WATCH FOR DANGER WHILE THE OTHERS TUCKED THEIR HEADS UNDER THEIR WINGS THEY WERE FINE LOOKING EVEN WHEN THEY SLEPT AND SOME PEOPLE NEVER LOOK WELL UNLESS THEY ARE AWAKE THEY WERE BROWNISH GRAY WITH NO BRIGHT MARKINGS AT ALL
8419-286667-0009 AND THEIR LONG LEGS GAVE THEM A VERY GENTEEL LOOK THE TOPS OF THEIR HEADS WERE COVERED WITH WARTY RED SKIN FROM WHICH GREW SHORT BLACK FEATHERS THAT LOOKED MORE LIKE HAIRS ONE MORNING WHEN THE CRANES AWAKENED
8419-286667-0010 A FINE YOUNG FELLOW BEGAN TO STRUT UP AND DOWN BEFORE THE REST BOWING LOW AND LEAPING HIGH INTO THE AIR AND EVERY NOW AND THEN WHOOPING AS LOUDLY AS HE COULD THE GULLS WHO HAD SPENT THE WINTER BY THE POND SCREAMED TO EACH OTHER THE CRANE DANCE HAS BEGUN
8419-286667-0011 EVEN THE FROGS WHO ARE AFRAID OF CRANES CREPT QUIETLY NEAR TO LOOK ON IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE ANOTHER YOUNG CRANE BEGAN TO SKIP AND HOP AND CIRCLE AROUND DROOPING HIS WINGS AND WHOOPING AS HE WENT
8419-286667-0012 EVERY CRANE DANCED BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ALL AND AS THEY DID SO THEY LOOKED LOVINGLY AT EACH OTHER AND ADMIRED THE FINE STEPS AND ENJOYED THE WHOOPING THIS WENT ON UNTIL THEY WERE SO TIRED THEY COULD HARDLY STAND AND HAD TO STOP TO EAT AND REST
8419-286667-0013 WHEN THEY WERE EATING THE YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEGUN THE DANCE STALKED UP TO THE SISTER OF ONE OF HIS FRIENDS AS SHE STOOD IN THE EDGE OF THE POND GRACEFULLY BALANCED ON ONE LEG SHE DID NOT TURN HER HEAD TOWARDS HIM ALTHOUGH HAVING SUCH A LONG AND SLENDER NECK
8419-286667-0014 SHE STOOD WITH HER HEAD ON HER BREAST AND LOOKED AT THE WATER AFTER A WHILE HE TRUMPETED SOFTLY AS THOUGH HE WERE JUST TRYING HIS VOICE THEN SHE GAVE A PRETTY LITTLE START AND SAID OH ARE YOU HERE HOW YOU DID FRIGHTEN ME
8419-286667-0015 I AM SORRY HE SAID I DID NOT WANT TO FRIGHTEN YOU AND HE LOOKED AT HER ADMIRINGLY IT WAS JUST FOR A MINUTE SHE ANSWERED
8419-286667-0016 THEN THEY STOOD AND FISHED FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING WHEN SHE FLEW AWAY SHE SAID THAT IS A VERY PLEASANT FISHING PLACE HE STOOD ON THE OTHER LEG FOR A WHILE AND THOUGHT HOW SWEET HER VOICE SOUNDED AS SHE SAID IT
8419-286667-0017 THEN HE THOUGHT THAT IF SHE LIKED THE PLACE SO WELL SHE MIGHT COME THERE AGAIN THE NEXT DAY HE WONDERED WHY HE COULD NOT COME TOO ALTHOUGH EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT A CRANE CATCHES MORE IF HE FISHES ALONE THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE CRANES DANCED
8419-286667-0018 HE BOWED TO HER OFTENER THAN TO ANY OF THE REST AND HE THOUGHT SHE NOTICED IT THEY DANCED UNTIL THEY WERE ALMOST TOO TIRED TO MOVE
8419-286667-0019 AS SHE STALKED OFF TOWARD THE POND SHE PASSED HIM AND SHE SAID OVER HER SHOULDER I SHOULD THINK YOU WOULD BE HUNGRY I AM ALMOST STARVED AFTER SHE HAD GONE HE WONDERED WHY SHE HAD SAID THAT
8419-286667-0020 IF HE HAD BEEN AN OLDER CRANE AND UNDERSTOOD THE WAYS OF THE WORLD A LITTLE BETTER HE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT SHE MEANT AREN'T YOU COMING TO THAT FISHING PLACE I AM GOING NOW
8419-286667-0021 STILL ALTHOUGH HE WAS SUCH A YOUNG CRANE AND HAD NEVER DANCED UNTIL THIS YEAR HE BEGAN TO THINK THAT SHE LIKED HIM AND ENJOYED HAVING HIM NEAR SO HE FLEW OFF TO THE FISHING PLACE WHERE HE HAD SEEN HER THE DAY BEFORE AND HE STALKED ALONG TO WHERE SHE WAS
8419-286667-0022 HE PITIED SHORT NECKED PEOPLE THEN HE SAID POOH I CAN TAKE BIGGER MOUTHFULS THAN THAT YOU OUGHT TO SEE WHAT BIG MOUTHFULS I CAN TAKE SHE CHANGED AND STOOD ON HER OTHER LEG I SAW YOU DANCING THIS MORNING SHE SAID
8419-286667-0023 FOR ALL THE EIGHT CRANES HAD DANCED TOGETHER BUT HE THOUGHT IT VERY WONDERFUL DID YOU NOTICE TO WHOM I BOWED HE ASKED HE WAS SO EXCITED THAT HIS KNEES SHOOK AND HE HAD TO STAND ON BOTH LEGS AT ONCE TO KEEP FROM FALLING
8419-286667-0024 WHEN A CRANE IS AS MUCH EXCITED AS THAT IT IS PRETTY SERIOUS TO MY SISTER SHE ASKED CARELESSLY AS SHE DREW ONE OF HER LONG TAIL FEATHERS THROUGH HER BEAK NO SAID HE I BOWED TO HER SISTER
8419-286667-0025 AND SHE SAID SHE COULDN'T REMEMBER THAT SHE NEVER COULD REMEMBER WHAT SHE HAD FORGOTTEN IT MADE HIM FEEL VERY BADLY TO HAVE HER LEAVE HIM SO HE WANTED A CHANCE TO TELL HER SOMETHING YET WHENEVER HE TRIED TO IT SEEMED TO STICK IN HIS BILL HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT SHE DIDN'T LIKE HIM
8419-286667-0026 AND THE NEXT TIME THE CRANES DANCED HE DIDN'T BOW TO HER SO MUCH BUT HE STRUTTED AND LEAPED AND WHOOPED EVEN MORE AND SHE STRUTTED AND LEAPED AND WHOOPED ALMOST AS LOUDLY AS HE WHEN THEY WERE ALL TIRED OUT AND HAD STOPPED DANCING SHE SAID TO HIM I AM SO TIRED
8419-286667-0027 LET US GO OFF INTO THE WOODS AND REST YOU MAY BE VERY SURE HE WAS GLAD TO GO AND AS HE STALKED OFF WITH HER HE LED THE WAY TO A CHARMING NESTING PLACE HE DIDN'T KNOW JUST HOW TO TELL WHAT HE WANTED TO BUT HE HAD SEEN ANOTHER CRANE BOWING TO HER
8419-286667-0028 AND WAS AFRAID SHE MIGHT MARRY HIM IF HE WAS NOT QUICK NOW HE POINTED WITH ONE WING TO THIS NESTING PLACE AND SAID HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO BUILD A NEST THERE SHE LOOKED WHERE HE HAD POINTED I SHE SAID WHY
8419-286667-0029 IT IS A LOVELY PLACE BUT I COULD NEVER HAVE A NEST ALONE LET ME HELP YOU HE SAID I WANT TO MARRY AND HAVE A HOME WHY SAID SHE AS SHE PREENED HER FEATHERS THAT IS A VERY GOOD PLAN
8419-286667-0030 WHEN DID YOU THINK OF IT SO THEY WERE MARRIED AND MISSUS SAND HILL CRANE OFTEN TOLD HER FRIENDS AFTERWARD THAT MISTER CRANE WAS SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT SHE JUST HAD TO MARRY HIM THEY WERE VERY VERY HAPPY AND AFTER A WHILE
8419-286676-0000 THE CLEVER WATER ADDER NONE OF THE POND PEOPLE WERE ALONE MORE THAN THE WATER ADDERS THE SNAPPING TURTLE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF A GREAT DEAL UNTIL THE DAY WHEN HE AND BELOSTOMA DROVE AWAY THE BOYS AFTER THAT
8419-286676-0001 HIS NEIGHBORS BEGAN TO UNDERSTAND HIM BETTER AND HE WAS LESS GRUMPY SO THAT THOSE WHO WORE SHELLS WERE SOON QUITE FOND OF HIM BELOSTOMA DID NOT HAVE MANY FRIENDS AMONG THE SMALLER PEOPLE AND ONLY A FEW AMONG THE LARGER ONES THEY SAID THAT HE WAS CRUEL
8419-286676-0002 AND THAT HE HAD A BAD HABIT OF USING HIS STOUT SUCKING TUBE TO STING WITH STILL BELOSTOMA DID NOT CARE HE SAID A GIANT WATER BUG DOES NOT ALWAYS LIVE IN THE WATER I SHALL HAVE MY WINGS SOON AND LEAVE THE WATER AND MARRY
8419-286676-0003 AFTER THAT I SHALL FLY AWAY ON MY WEDDING TRIP MISSUS BELOSTOMA MAY GO WITH ME IF SHE FEELS LIKE DOING SO AFTER LAYING HER EGGS HERE I SHALL GO ANYWAY AND I SHALL FLUTTER AND SPRAWL AROUND THE LIGHT AND STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHER ME AND HAVE A HAPPY TIME
8419-286676-0004 THAT WAS BELOSTOMA'S WAY HE WOULD STING PEOPLE WHO BOTHERED HIM BUT THEN HE ALWAYS SAID THAT THEY NEED NOT HAVE BOTHERED HIM AND PERHAPS THAT WAS SO WITH THE WATER ADDERS IT WAS DIFFERENT THEY WERE GOOD NATURED ENOUGH
8419-286676-0005 YET THE MUD TURTLES AND SNAPPING TURTLE WERE THE ONLY ONES WHO EVER CALLED UPON THEM AND FOUND THEM AT HOME THE SMALL PEOPLE WITHOUT SHELLS WERE AFRAID OF THEM AND THE CLAMS AND POND SNAILS NEVER CALLED UPON ANY ONE THE MINNOWS SAID THEY COULD NOT BEAR THE LOOKS OF THE ADDERS
8419-286676-0006 THEY HAD SUCH UGLY MOUTHS AND SUCH QUICK MOTIONS THE LARGER FISHES KEPT AWAY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR CHILDREN WHO WERE SMALL AND TENDER ONE MIGHT THINK THAT THE SAND HILL CRANES THE FISH HAWKS AND THE OTHER SHORE FAMILIES WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD FRIENDS FOR THEM BUT WHEN THEY CALLED
8419-286676-0007 THE ADDERS WERE ALWAYS AWAY PEOPLE SAID THAT THE ADDERS WERE AFRAID OF THEM THE YELLOW BROWN FROG WISHED THAT THE ADDERS COULD BE SCARED BADLY SCARED SOME TIME SO SCARED THAT A CHILLY FEELING WOULD RUN DOWN THEIR BACKS FROM THEIR HEADS CLEAR TO THE TIPS OF THEIR TAILS
8419-286676-0008 I WISH SAID HE THAT THE CHILLY FEELING WOULD BE BIG ENOUGH TO GO WAY THROUGH TO THEIR BELLIES THEIR BELLIES ARE ONLY THE FRONT SIDE OF THEIR BACKS ANYWAY HE ADDED BECAUSE THEY ARE SO THIN OF COURSE THIS WAS A DREADFUL WISH TO MAKE
8419-286676-0009 BUT PEOPLE SAID THAT ONE OF THE ADDERS HAD FRIGHTENED THE YELLOW BROWN FROG SO THAT HE NEVER GOT OVER IT AND THIS WAS THE REASON HE FELT SO THE WATER ADDERS WERE CERTAINLY THE CLEVEREST PEOPLE IN THE POND
8419-286676-0010 SHE COULD DO ALMOST ANYTHING AND SHE KNEW IT SHE TALKED ABOUT IT TOO AND THAT SHOWED BAD TASTE AND WAS ONE REASON WHY SHE WAS NOT LIKED BETTER SHE COULD SWIM VERY FAST COULD CREEP GLIDE
8419-286676-0011 CATCH HOLD OF THINGS WITH HER TAIL HANG HERSELF FROM THE BRANCH OF A TREE LIFT HER HEAD FAR INTO THE AIR LEAP DART BOUND AND DIVE ALL HER FAMILY COULD DO THESE THINGS BUT SHE COULD DO THEM A LITTLE THE BEST ONE DAY SHE WAS HANGING OVER THE POND IN A VERY GRACEFUL POSITION
8419-286676-0012 WITH HER TAIL TWISTED CARELESSLY AROUND A WILLOW BRANCH THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND A MUD TURTLE FATHER WERE IN THE SHALLOW WATER BELOW HER HER SLENDER FORKED TONGUE WAS DARTING IN AND OUT OF HER OPEN MOUTH
8419-286676-0013 IT IS USEFUL IN FEELING OF THINGS SHE SAID AND THEN I HAVE ALWAYS THOUGHT IT QUITE BECOMING SHE COULD SEE HERSELF REFLECTED IN THE STILL WATER BELOW HER AND SHE NOTICED HOW PRETTILY THE DARK BROWN OF HER BACK SHADED INTO THE WHITE OF HER BELLY
8419-286676-0014 YOU SEE SHE WAS VAIN AS WELL AS CLEVER THE SNAPPING TURTLE FELT CROSS TO DAY AND HAD COME TO SEE IF A TALK WITH HER WOULD NOT MAKE HIM FEEL BETTER THE MUD TURTLE WAS TIRED OF HAVING THE CHILDREN SPRAWL AROUND HIM
8419-286676-0015 AND OF MISSUS MUD TURTLE TELLING ABOUT THE TROUBLE SHE HAD TO GET THE RIGHT KIND OF FOOD THE CLEVER WATER ADDER SPOKE FIRST OF THE WEATHER IT MUST BE DREADFULLY HOT FOR THE SHORE PEOPLE SHE SAID
8419-286676-0016 AND FLY AROUND IN THE SUNSHINE TO FIND FOOD FOR THEIR CHILDREN AH YES SAID THE MUD TURTLE HOW THEY MUST WISH FOR SHELLS HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT FOR TO FLY WITH
8419-286676-0017 LET THEM COME IN SWIMMING WITH THEIR CHILDREN IF THEY ARE WARM AND TIRED THE WATER ADDER LAUGHED IN HER SNAKY WAY AND SHOWED HER SHARP TEETH I HAVE HEARD SHE SAID THAT WHEN THE WILD DUCKS BRING THEIR CHILDREN HERE TO SWIM
8419-286676-0018 THEY DO NOT ALWAYS TAKE SO MANY HOME AS THEY BROUGHT THE SNAPPING TURTLE BECAME VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN HIS WARTY RIGHT FORELEG AND DID NOT SEEM TO HEAR WHAT SHE SAID THE MUD TURTLE SMILED I HAVE HEARD SHE WENT ON
8419-286676-0019 THAT WHEN YOUNG DUCKS DIVE HEAD FIRST THEY ARE QUITE SURE TO COME UP AGAIN BUT THAT WHEN THEY DIVE FEET FIRST THEY NEVER COME UP
8419-286676-0020 ASKED THE SNAPPING TURTLE AND HE WAS SNAPPY ABOUT IT OH NOTHING REPLIED THE WATER ADDER SWINGING HER HEAD BACK AND FORTH AND LOOKING AT THE SCALES ON HER BODY I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
8419-286676-0021 AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BUT I HAVE TO EAT SOMETHING AND IF I AM SWIMMING UNDER THE WATER AND A DUCKLING PADDLES ALONG JUST ABOVE ME AND STICKS HIS FOOT INTO MY MOUTH I AM LIKELY TO SWALLOW HIM BEFORE I THINK THE WATER ADDER SAW THAT HE WAS PROVOKED BY WHAT SHE HAD SAID SO SHE TALKED ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE
8419-286676-0022 I THINK THE DUCKS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN SAID SHE THEY MAKE SUCH A FUSS OVER THEM AND THEY ARE NOT NEARLY SO BRIGHT AS MY CHILDREN WHY MINE HATCH AS SOON AS THE EGGS ARE LAID AND GO HUNTING AT ONCE THEY ARE NO TROUBLE AT ALL
8419-286676-0023 I NEVER WORRY ABOUT MINE SAID THE MUD TURTLE ALTHOUGH THEIR MOTHER THINKS IT IS NOT SAFE FOR THEM ALL TO SLEEP AT ONCE AS THEY DO ON A LOG IN THE SUNSHINE IT ISN'T SAID THE ADDER DECIDEDLY I NEVER CLOSE MY EYES
8419-286676-0024 MOST OF THEM REMARKED THE TURTLES ALL OF THEM SHE SAID EXCEPT US ADDERS AND THE TURTLES I EVEN THINK THAT SOME OF THE TURTLES ARE A LITTLE QUEER DON'T YOU WE HAVE THOUGHT SO SAID THE MUD TURTLE
8419-286676-0025 THEY CERTAINLY ARE AGREED THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHO WAS BEGINNING TO FEEL MUCH BETTER NATURED WHAT DID YOU SAY ASKED THE ADDER WHO LIKE ALL HER FAMILY WAS A LITTLE DEAF OUCH EXCLAIMED THE SNAPPING TURTLE
8419-286676-0026 OUCH OUCH WHAT IS THE MATTER ASKED THE MUD TURTLE THEN HE BEGAN TO SLAP THE WATER WITH HIS SHORT STOUT TAIL AND SAY OUCH
8419-286676-0027 TWO NAUGHTY YOUNG WATER BOATMEN HAD SWUM QUIETLY UP ON THEIR BACKS AND STUNG THE TURTLES ON THEIR TAILS THEN THEY SWAM AWAY PUSHING THEMSELVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE WATER WITH SWIFT STROKES OF THEIR HAIRY OAR LEGS
8419-286676-0028 AND HE BACKED INTO THE MUD KNOWING THAT FINE SOFT MUD IS THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD FOR STINGS
8419-286676-0029 IF I COULD ONLY REACH MY TAIL WITH MY HEAD OR EVEN WITH ONE OF MY HIND FEET
8419-286676-0030 ASKED THE WATER ADDER IN HER SWEETEST VOICE NOTHING IS EASIER AND SHE WOUND HERSELF AROUND THE WILLOW BRANCH IN ANOTHER GRACEFUL POSITION AND TOOK THE TIP OF HER TAIL DAINTILY BETWEEN HER TEETH HUMPH SAID THE SNAPPING TURTLE
8419-286676-0031 AND HE PULLED HIS TAIL OUT OF THE MUD AND SWAM AWAY
8419-286676-0032 SAID THE MUD TURTLE AND HE SWAM AWAY WITH THE SNAPPING TURTLE WHAT A RUDE PERSON SHE IS THEY SAID ALWAYS TRYING TO SHOW HOW MUCH MORE CLEVER SHE IS THAN OTHER PEOPLE WE WOULD RATHER BE STUPID AND POLITE AFTER A WHILE THE SNAPPING TURTLE SAID
8419-286676-0033 BUT THEN YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT STUPID OF COURSE NOT REPLIED THE MUD TURTLE
8419-293469-0000 IN ALL THE MEADOW THERE WAS NOBODY WHO COULD TELL SUCH INTERESTING STORIES AS THE OLD TREE FROG EVEN THE GARTER SNAKE WHO HAD BEEN THERE THE LONGEST AND THE OLD CRICKET WHO HAD LIVED IN THE FARM YARD COULD TELL NO SUCH EXCITING TALES AS THE TREE FROG
8419-293469-0001 ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS OF WHICH HE TOLD HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE CAME TO THE MEADOW
8419-293469-0002 NONE OF HIS FRIENDS HAD KNOWN HIM THEN BUT HE WAS AN HONEST FELLOW AND THEY WERE SURE THAT EVERYTHING HE TOLD WAS TRUE BESIDES THEY MUST BE TRUE FOR HOW COULD A BODY EVER THINK OUT SUCH REMARKABLE TALES FROM HIS OWN HEAD
8419-293469-0003 WHEN HE FIRST CAME TO HIS HOME BY THE ELM TREE HE WAS VERY THIN AND LOOKED AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN SICK THE KATYDIDS WHO STAYED NEAR SAID THAT HE CROAKED IN HIS SLEEP AND THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT WHAT WELL AND HAPPY FROGS SHOULD DO
8419-293469-0004 ONE DAY WHEN MANY OF THE MEADOW PEOPLE WERE GATHERED AROUND HIM HE TOLD THEM HIS STORY WHEN I WAS A LITTLE FELLOW HE SAID I WAS STRONG AND WELL AND COULD LEAP FARTHER THAN ANY OTHER FROG OF MY SIZE
8419-293469-0005 I WAS HATCHED IN THE POND BEYOND THE FARM HOUSE AND ATE MY WAY FROM THE EGG TO THE WATER OUTSIDE LIKE ANY OTHER FROG PERHAPS I OUGHT TO SAY LIKE ANY OTHER TADPOLE FOR OF COURSE I BEGAN LIFE AS A TADPOLE
8419-293469-0006 I PLAYED AND ATE WITH MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND LITTLE DREAMED WHAT TROUBLE WAS IN STORE FOR ME WHEN I GREW UP WE WERE ALL IN A HURRY TO BE FROGS
8419-293469-0007 OH HOW HAPPY WE WERE THEN I REMEMBER THE DAY WHEN MY HIND LEGS BEGAN TO GROW AND HOW THE OTHER TADPOLES CROWDED AROUND ME IN THE WATER AND SWAM CLOSE TO ME TO FEEL THE TWO LITTLE BUNCHES THAT WERE TO BE LEGS
8419-293469-0008 MY FORE LEGS DID NOT GROW UNTIL LATER AND THESE BUNCHES CAME JUST IN FRONT OF MY TAIL YOUR TAIL CRIED A PUZZLED YOUNG CRICKET
8419-293469-0009 I DID HAVE WHEN I WAS A TADPOLE SAID THE TREE FROG I HAD A BEAUTIFUL WIGGLY LITTLE TAIL WITH WHICH TO SWIM THROUGH THE WATERS OF THE POND BUT AS MY LEGS GREW LARGER AND STRONGER MY TAIL GREW LITTLER AND WEAKER UNTIL THERE WASN'T ANY TAIL LEFT
8419-293469-0010 THE KNOBS ON THE ENDS OF MY TOES WERE STICKY SO THAT I COULD CLIMB A TREE AND THEN I WAS READY TO START ON MY TRAVELS SOME OF THE OTHER FROGS STARTED WITH ME BUT THEY STOPPED ALONG THE WAY AND AT LAST I WAS ALONE
8419-293469-0011 I WAS A BOLD YOUNG FELLOW AND WHEN I SAW A GREAT WHITE THING AMONG THE TREES UP YONDER I MADE UP MY MIND TO SEE WHAT IT WAS THERE WAS A GREAT RED THING IN THE YARD BESIDE IT BUT I LIKED THE WHITE ONE BETTER
8419-293469-0012 I HOPPED ALONG AS FAST AS I COULD FOR I DID NOT THEN KNOW ENOUGH TO BE AFRAID I GOT CLOSE UP TO THEM BOTH AND SAW STRANGE BIG CREATURES GOING IN AND OUT OF THE RED THING THE BARN AS I AFTERWARD FOUND IT WAS CALLED
8419-293469-0013 THE LARGEST CREATURES HAD FOUR LEGS AND SOME OF THEM HAD HORNS THE SMALLER CREATURES HAD ONLY TWO LEGS ON WHICH TO WALK AND TWO OTHER LIMBS OF SOME SORT WITH WHICH THEY LIFTED AND CARRIED THINGS
8419-293469-0014 THE QUEEREST THING ABOUT IT WAS THAT THE SMALLER CREATURES SEEMED TO MAKE THE LARGER ONES DO WHATEVER THEY WANTED THEM TO THEY EVEN MADE SOME OF THEM HELP DO THEIR WORK YOU MAY NOT BELIEVE ME BUT WHAT I TELL YOU IS TRUE
8419-293469-0015 AS YOU MAY GUESS I STAYED THERE A LONG TIME WATCHING THESE STRANGE CREATURES WORK
8419-293469-0016 THERE WERE SOME BRIGHT COLORED FLOWERS NEAR THE HOUSE AND I CRAWLED IN AMONG THEM THERE I RESTED UNTIL SUNSET AND THEN BEGAN MY EVENING SONG WHILE I WAS SINGING ONE OF THE PEOPLE FROM THE HOUSE CAME OUT AND FOUND ME
8419-293469-0017 SHE PICKED ME UP AND CARRIED ME INSIDE OH HOW FRIGHTENED I WAS MY HEART THUMPED AS THOUGH IT WOULD BURST AND I TRIED MY BEST TO GET AWAY FROM HER SHE DIDN'T HURT ME AT ALL BUT SHE WOULD NOT LET ME GO
8419-293469-0018 SHE PUT ME IN A VERY QUEER PRISON AT FIRST WHEN SHE PUT ME DOWN ON A STONE IN SOME WATER I DID NOT KNOW THAT I WAS IN PRISON I TRIED TO HOP AWAY AND BUMP WENT MY HEAD AGAINST SOMETHING
8419-293469-0019 WONDERFUL INDEED AND AT THE TOP CONTINUED THE TREE FROG WAS SOMETHING WHITE OVER THE DOORWAY INTO MY PRISON IN THE BOTTOM WERE WATER AND A STONE AND FROM THE BOTTOM TO THE TOP WAS A LADDER
8419-293469-0020 I HAD ENOUGH TO EAT BUT ANYBODY WHO HAS BEEN FREE CANNOT BE HAPPY SHUT IN I WATCHED MY CHANCE AND THREE TIMES I GOT OUT WHEN THE LITTLE DOOR WAS NOT QUITE CLOSED TWICE I WAS CAUGHT AND PUT BACK
8419-293469-0021 IN THE PLEASANT WEATHER OF COURSE I WENT TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER AND WHEN IT WAS GOING TO RAIN I WOULD GO DOWN AGAIN EVERY TIME THAT I WENT UP OR DOWN THOSE DREADFUL CREATURES WOULD PUT THEIR FACES UP CLOSE TO MY PRISON
8419-293469-0022 AND I COULD HEAR A ROARING SOUND WHICH MEANT THEY WERE TALKING AND LAUGHING THE LAST TIME I GOT OUT
8419-293469-0023 AFTER THEY STOPPED HUNTING THE WIND BLEW THE DOOR OPEN AND I HOPPED OUT YOU DON'T SAY EXCLAIMED A GRASSHOPPER
8419-293469-0024 BUT FOR A LONG TIME I COULD NOT SLEEP WITHOUT DREAMING THAT I WAS BACK IN PRISON AND I WOULD CROAK IN MY SLEEP AT THE THOUGHT OF IT I HEARD YOU CRIED THE KATYDID AND I WONDERED WHAT WAS THE MATTER MATTER ENOUGH SAID THE TREE FROG
8419-293469-0025 IT MAKES MY SKIN DRY TO THINK OF IT NOW AND FRIENDS THE BEST WAY I CAN EVER REPAY YOUR KINDNESS TO ME IS TO TELL YOU TO NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER GO NEAR THE FARM HOUSE AND THEY ALL ANSWERED
8419-293473-0000 THE DIGNIFIED WALKING STICKS THREE WALKING STICKS FROM THE FOREST HAD COME TO LIVE IN THE BIG MAPLE TREE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE MEADOW NOBODY KNEW EXACTLY WHY THEY HAD LEFT THE FOREST WHERE ALL THEIR SISTERS AND COUSINS AND AUNTS LIVED
8419-293473-0001 PERHAPS THEY WERE NOT HAPPY WITH THEIR RELATIVES BUT THEN IF ONE IS A WALKING STICK YOU KNOW ONE DOES NOT CARE SO VERY MUCH ABOUT ONE'S FAMILY THESE WALKING STICKS HAD GROWN UP THE BEST WAY THEY COULD WITH NO FATHER OR MOTHER TO CARE FOR THEM
8419-293473-0002 THEY HAD NEVER BEEN TAUGHT TO DO ANYTHING USEFUL OR TO THINK MUCH ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE HUNGRY THEY ATE SOME LEAVES AND NEVER THOUGHT WHAT THEY SHOULD EAT THE NEXT TIME THAT THEY HAPPENED TO BE HUNGRY WHEN THEY WERE TIRED THEY WENT TO SLEEP
8419-293473-0003 AND WHEN THEY HAD SLEPT ENOUGH THEY AWAKENED THEY HAD NOTHING TO DO BUT TO EAT AND SLEEP AND THEY DID NOT OFTEN TAKE THE TROUBLE TO THINK THEY FELT THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE BETTER THAN THOSE MEADOW PEOPLE WHO RUSHED AND SCRAMBLED AND WORKED FROM MORNING UNTIL NIGHT AND THEY SHOWED VERY PLAINLY HOW THEY FELT
8419-293473-0004 THEY SAID IT WAS NOT GENTEEL TO HURRY NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENED ONE DAY THE TREE FROG WAS UNDER THE TREE WHEN THE LARGE BROWN WALKING STICK DECIDED TO LAY SOME EGGS HE SAW HER DROPPING THEM CARELESSLY AROUND ON THE GROUND AND ASKED
8419-293473-0005 DO YOU NEVER FIX A PLACE FOR YOUR EGGS A PLACE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK WAVING HER LONG AND SLENDER FEELERS TO AND FRO A PLACE OH NO I THINK THEY WILL HATCH WHERE THEY ARE IT IS TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO FIND A PLACE
8419-293473-0006 SOME MOTHERS DO NOT THINK IT TOO MUCH TROUBLE TO BE CAREFUL WHERE THEY LAY EGGS THAT MAY BE SAID THE BROWN WALKING STICK BUT THEY DO NOT BELONG TO OUR FAMILY SHE SPOKE AS IF THOSE WHO DID NOT BELONG TO HER FAMILY MIGHT BE GOOD BUT COULD NEVER BE GENTEEL
8419-293473-0007 SHE HAD ONCE TOLD HER BROTHER THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK THAT SHE WOULD NOT WANT TO LIVE IF SHE COULD NOT BE GENTEEL SHE THOUGHT THE MEADOW PEOPLE VERY COMMON THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK LOOKED MUCH LIKE HIS SISTER HE HAD THE SAME LONG SLENDER BODY
8419-293473-0008 THE SAME LONG FEELERS AND THE SAME SORT OF LONG SLENDER LEGS IF YOU HAD PASSED THEM IN A HAY FIELD YOU WOULD SURELY HAVE THOUGHT EACH A STEM OF HAY UNLESS YOU HAPPENED TO SEE THEM MOVE THE OTHER WALKING STICK THEIR FRIEND WAS YOUNGER AND GREEN
8419-293473-0009 HE KNEW JUST WHAT TO EXPECT SO WHEN THE NUTHATCH SET HIM DOWN ON THE BARK TO LOOK AT HIM HE UNHOOKED HIS FEET FROM THE BARK AND TUMBLED TO THE GROUND THE NUTHATCH TRIED TO CATCH HIM AND BROKE OFF ONE OF HIS LEGS BUT SHE NEVER FOUND HIM AGAIN ALTHOUGH SHE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED
8419-293473-0010 THAT WAS BECAUSE HE CRAWLED INTO A CLUMP OF FERNS AND KEPT VERY STILL HIS SISTER CAME AND LOOKED AT HIM AND SAID NOW IF YOU WERE ONLY A SPIDER IT WOULD NOT BE LONG BEFORE YOU WOULD HAVE SIX LEGS AGAIN
8419-293473-0011 OF COURSE YOU KNOW SPIDERS NEVER DO HAVE A HUNDRED AND A WALKING STICK WOULDN'T BE WALKING WITHOUT ANY BUT THAT WAS JUST HIS WAY OF SPEAKING AND IT SHOWED WHAT KIND OF INSECT HE WAS HIS RELATIVES ALL WAVED THEIR FEELERS ONE AT A TIME AND SAID
8419-293473-0012 AH HE HAS THE TRUE WALKING STICK SPIRIT THEN THEY PAID NO MORE ATTENTION TO HIM AND AFTER A WHILE HE AND HIS SISTER AND THEIR GREEN LITTLE FRIEND LEFT THE FOREST FOR THE MEADOW ON THE DAY WHEN THE GRASS WAS CUT THEY HAD SAT QUIETLY IN THEIR TREES AND LOOKED GENTEEL
8419-293473-0013 THEIR FEELERS WERE HELD QUITE CLOSE TOGETHER AND THEY DID NOT MOVE THEIR FEET AT ALL ONLY SWAYED THEIR BODIES GRACEFULLY FROM SIDE TO SIDE NOW THEY WERE ON THE GROUND HUNTING THROUGH THE FLAT PILES OF CUT GRASS FOR SOME FRESH AND JUICY BITS TO EAT
8419-293473-0014 THE ANTS WERE SCRAMBLING AROUND AS BUSY AS EVER AND LIFE WENT ON QUITE AS THOUGH NEITHER MEN NOR HORSES HAD EVER ENTERED THE MEADOW SEE CRIED A SPIDER WHO WAS BUSILY LOOKING AFTER HER WEB THERE COMES A HORSE DRAWING SOMETHING AND THE FARMER SITTING ON IT AND DRIVING
8419-293473-0015 WHEN THE HORSE WAS WELL INTO THE MEADOW THE FARMER MOVED A BAR AND THE QUEER LOOKING MACHINE BEGAN TO KICK THE GRASS THIS WAY AND THAT WITH ITS MANY STIFF AND SHINING LEGS A FRISKY YOUNG GRASSHOPPER KICKED IN THE SAME WAY AND HAPPENED JUST HAPPENED OF COURSE
8419-293473-0016 THEN THERE WAS A GREAT SCRAMBLING AND THE CRICKETS FROLICKED WITH THEM THE YOUNG WALKING STICK THOUGHT IT LOOKED LIKE GREAT FUN AND ALMOST WISHED HERSELF SOME OTHER KIND OF INSECT SO THAT SHE COULD TUMBLE AROUND IN THE SAME WAY SHE DID NOT QUITE WISH IT YOU UNDERSTAND
8419-293473-0017 AND WOULD NEVER HAVE THOUGHT OF IT IF SHE HAD TURNED BROWN AH SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK WHAT SCRAMBLING HOW VERY COMMON YES INDEED SAID HIS SISTER WHY CAN'T THEY LEARN TO MOVE SLOWLY AND GRACEFULLY
8419-293473-0018 PERHAPS THEY CAN'T HELP BEING FAT BUT THEY MIGHT AT LEAST ACT GENTEEL WHAT IS IT TO BE GENTEEL ASKED A GRASSHOPPER SUDDENLY HE HAD HEARD EVERY WORD THAT THE WALKING STICK SAID WHY SAID THE FIVE LEGGED WALKING STICK
8419-293473-0019 IT IS JUST TO BE GENTEEL TO ACT AS YOU SEE US ACT AND TO JUST HERE THE HAY TEDDER PASSED OVER THEM AND EVERY ONE OF THE WALKING STICKS WAS SENT FLYING THROUGH THE AIR AND LANDED ON HIS BACK
8419-293473-0020 THE WALKING STICKS LOOKED VERY UNCOMFORTABLE AND THE BROTHER AND SISTER COULD NOT THINK OF ANYTHING TO SAY IT WAS THE YOUNG GREEN ONE WHO SPOKE AT LAST
8425-246962-0000 BEFORE THE MORNING LEOPOLD LAY WOUND IN THE NET OF A LOW FEVER ALMOST AS ILL AS EVER BUT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR LESS TROUBLED AND THAT EVEN HIS MOST RESTLESS DREAMS
8425-246962-0001 TO THE FINAL EXECUTION OF THE LAW SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD FOLLOW IT ALL IN HIS MOVEMENTS AND THE EXPRESSIONS OF HIS COUNTENANCE AT A CERTAIN POINT THE COLD DEW ALWAYS APPEARED ON HIS FOREHEAD
8425-246962-0002 TALKING FACE TO FACE WITH JESUS
8425-246962-0003 WAS AMAZING IN ITS BEAUTY FOR HELEN HERSELF SHE WAS PREY TO A HOST OF CHANGEFUL EMOTIONS AT ONE TIME SHE ACCUSED HERSELF BITTERLY OF HAVING BEEN THE CAUSE OF THE RETURN OF HIS ILLNESS
8425-246962-0004 THE NEXT A GUSH OF GLADNESS WOULD SWELL HER HEART AT THE THOUGHT THAT NOW SHE HAD HIM AT LEAST SAFER FOR A WHILE AND THAT HE MIGHT DIE AND SO ESCAPE THE WHOLE CROWD OF HORRIBLE POSSIBILITIES
8425-246962-0005 FOR GEORGE'S MANIPULATION OF THE MAGISTRATE COULD BUT DELAY THE DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUTH EVEN SHOULD NO DISCOVERY BE MADE LEOPOLD MUST AT LENGTH SUSPECT A TRICK AND THAT WOULD AT ONCE DRIVE HIM TO FRESH ACTION
8425-246962-0006 BUT AMONGST THE REST A FEELING WHICH HAD BUT LATELY BEGUN TO INDICATE ITS FAR OFF PRESENCE NOW THREATENED TO BRING WITH IT A DEEPER AND MORE PERMANENT SORROW IT BECAME MORE AND MORE PLAIN TO HER
8425-246962-0007 THAT SHE HAD TAKEN THE EVIL PART AGAINST THE ONE SHE LOVED BEST IN THE WORLD THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS A SATAN TO HIM HAD DRIVEN HIM BACK STOOD ALMOST BODILY IN THE WAY TO TURN HIM FROM THE PATH OF PEACE
8425-246962-0008 WHILE SHE FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF SHAME AND PITY FOR THE SAKE OF THE FAMILY AS SHE HAD SAID TO HERSELF HAD PURSUED A COURSE WHICH IF SUCCESSFUL WOULD AT BEST HAVE RESULTED IN SHUTTING HIM UP AS IN A MADHOUSE
8425-246962-0009 WITH HIS OWN INBORN HORRORS WITH VAIN REMORSE AND EQUALLY VAIN LONGING HER CONSCIENCE NOW THAT HER MIND WAS QUIETER FROM THE GREATER DISTANCE TO WHICH THE THREATENING PERIL HAD AGAIN WITHDRAWN
8425-246962-0010 WITHOUT COMMITTING THE SUICIDE OF SURRENDER SHE COULD NOT SEE THAT CONFESSION WAS THE VERY DOOR OF REFUGE AND SAFETY TOWARDS WHICH HE MUST PRESS GEORGE'S ABSENCE WAS NOW AGAIN A RELIEF
8425-246962-0011 AND WHILE SHE FEARED AND SHRANK FROM THE SEVERITY OF WINGFOLD SHE COULD NOT HELP A CERTAIN INDISCRIBABLE SENSE OF SAFETY IN HIS PRESENCE AT LEAST SO LONG AS LEOPOLD WAS TOO ILL TO TALK FOR THE CURATE
8425-246962-0012 HE BECAME MORE AND MORE INTERESTED IN THE WOMAN WHO COULD LOVE SO STRONGLY AND YET NOT ENTIRELY WHO SUFFERED AND MUST STILL SUFFER SO MUCH AND WHO A FAITH EVEN NO GREATER THAN HIS OWN MIGHT RENDER COMPARATIVELY BLESSED
8425-246962-0013 BUT TO SO MANY OF THE SECRET CHAMBERS OF THE SOULS OF THE CONGREGATION FOR WHAT A MAN DARES NOT COULD NOT IF HE DARED AND DARED NOT IF HE COULD SAY TO ANOTHER EVEN AT THE TIME AND IN THE PLACE FITTEST OF ALL
8425-246962-0014 HE CAN SAY THENCE OPEN FACED BEFORE THE WHOLE CONGREGATION AND THE PERSON IN NEED THEREOF MAY HEAR IT WITHOUT UMBRAGE OR THE CHOKING HUSK OF INDIVIDUAL APPLICATION IRRITATING TO THE REJECTION OF WHAT TRUTH MAY LIE IN IT FOR HIM
8425-246962-0015 THEN WOULD MEN SOON UNDERSTAND THAT NOT THE FORM OF EVEN SOUNDEST WORDS AVAILETH ANYTHING BUT A NEW CREATURE WHEN WINGFOLD WAS IN THE PULPIT THEN HE COULD SPEAK AS FROM THE SECRET TO THE SECRET BUT ELSEWHERE HE FELT
8425-246962-0016 IN REGARD TO HELEN LIKE A TRANSPORT SHIP FILLED WITH TROOPS WHICH MUST GO SAILING AROUND THE SHORES OF AN INVADED ALLY
8425-246962-0017 IS IT AN INFIRMITY OF CERTAIN KINDS OF MEN OR A WISE PROVISION FOR THEIR PROTECTION THAT THE BRIGHTEST FORMS THE TRUTH TAKES IN THEIR PRIVATE COGITATIONS SEEM TO LOSE HALF THEIR LUSTRE
8425-246962-0018 AND ALL THEIR GRACE WHEN UTTERED IN THE PRESENCE OF AN UNRECEPTIVE NATURE AND THEY HEAR AS IT WERE THEIR OWN VOICE REFLECTED IN A POOR DULL INHARMONIOUS ECHO AND ARE DISGUSTED BUT ON THE OTHER HAND
8425-246962-0019 OR MISSING HIM GLOOMED BACK INTO THE LAND OF VISIONS THE TENDERNESS OF THE CURATE'S SERVICE THE HEART THAT SHOWED ITSELF IN EVERYTHING HE DID EVEN IN THE TURN AND EXPRESSION OF THE MINISTERING HAND
8425-246962-0020 WAS A KIND OF REVELATION TO HELEN FOR WHILE HIS INTELLECT WAS HANGING ABOUT THE DOOR ASKING QUESTIONS AND UNEASILY SHIFTING HITHER AND THITHER IN ITS UNLOVED PERPLEXITIES
8425-246962-0021 HAD HE NOT GONE FARTHER THAN HIS RIGHT HAD HE NOT IMPLIED MORE CONVICTION THAN WAS HIS WORDS COULD NOT GO BEYOND HIS SATISFACTION WITH WHAT HE FOUND IN THE GOSPEL OR THE HOPES FOR THE RANGE OF HIS
8425-246962-0022 CONSCIOUS LIFE SPRINGING THEREFROM BUT WAS HE NOT NOW MAKING PEOPLE SUPPOSE HIM MORE CERTAIN OF THE FACT OF THESE THINGS THAN HE WAS
8425-246962-0023 EVEN IF HE HAD BEEN SO CARRIED AWAY BY THE DELIGHT OF HIS HEART AS TO GIVE SUCH AN IMPRESSION IT MATTERED LITTLE WHAT WAS IT TO OTHER PEOPLE WHAT HE BELIEVED OR HOW HE BELIEVED IF HE HAD NOT BEEN UNTRUE TO HIMSELF
8425-246962-0024 NO HARM WOULD FOLLOW WAS A MAN NEVER TO TALK FROM THE HIGHEST IN HIM TO THE FORGETTING OF THE LOWER WAS A MAN NEVER TO BE CARRIED BEYOND HIMSELF AND THE REGIONS OF HIS KNOWLEDGE IF SO THEN FAREWELL POETRY AND PROPHECY
8425-246962-0025 YEA ALL GRAND DISCOVERY FOR THINGS MUST BE FORESEEN ERE THEY CAN BE REALIZED APPREHENDED ERE THEY BE COMPREHENDED THIS MUCH HE COULD SAY FOR HIMSELF AND NO MORE THAT HE WAS READY TO LAY DOWN HIS LIFE FOR THE MERE CHANCE
8425-246962-0026 BUT TO THE TRUTH TO THE LOVELINESS AND HARMONY AND RIGHTEOUSNESS AND SAFETY THAT HE SAW IN THE IDEA OF THE SON OF MAN AS HE READ IT IN THE STORY HE DARED NOT SAY WHAT IN A TIME OF PERSECUTION TORTURE MIGHT WORK UPON HIM
8425-246962-0027 BUT HE FELT RIGHT HOPEFUL THAT EVEN WERE HE BASE ENOUGH TO DENY HIM ANY COCK MIGHT CROW HIM BACK TO REPENTANCE AT THE SAME TIME HE SAW PLAIN ENOUGH THAT EVEN IF HE GAVE HIS BODY TO BE BURNED
8425-246962-0028 NOTHING COULD SATISFY HIM OF THAT LESS THAN THE CONSCIOUS PRESENCE OF THE PERFECT CHARITY WITHOUT THAT HE WAS STILL OUTSIDE THE KINGDOM WANDERING IN A DREAM AROUND ITS WALLS
8425-246962-0029 AND WITH EVERY FRESH CONFLICT EVERY FRESH GLEAM OF DOUBTFUL VICTORY THE ESSENTIAL IDEA OF THE MASTER LOOKED MORE AND MORE LOVELY AND HE BEGAN TO SEE THE WORKING OF HIS DOUBTS ON THE GROWTH OF HIS HEART AND SOUL
8425-246962-0030 HE HAD MUCH TIME FOR REFLECTION AS HE SAT SILENT BY THE BEDSIDE OF LEOPOLD SOMETIMES HELEN WOULD BE SITTING NEAR THOUGH GENERALLY WHEN HE ARRIVED SHE WENT OUT FOR HER WALK BUT NEVER ANYTHING CAME TO HIM HE COULD UTTER TO HER
8425-287387-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT DUCO VAN DER STAAL HAD TAKEN A LARGE VAULT LIKE STUDIO WITH A CHILLY NORTH LIGHT UP THREE FLIGHTS OF STAIRS IN THE VIA DEL BABUINO HERE HE PAINTED MODELLED AND STUDIED
8425-287387-0001 IN THE LITTLE SHOPS ALONG THE TIBER OR IN THE MERCATO DEI FIORI THAT WAS HIS PASSION TO HUNT THROUGH ROME FOR A PANEL OF AN OLD TRIPTYCH OR A FRAGMENT OF ANCIENT SCULPTURE
8425-287387-0002 IN THIS WAY HIS STUDIO HAD NOT REMAINED THE LARGE CHILLY VAULT LIKE WORKROOM BEARING WITNESS TO ZEALOUS AND SERIOUS STUDY BUT HAD BECOME A REFUGE FOR DIM COLOURED REMNANTS OF ANTIQUITY
8425-287387-0003 AND ANCIENT ART A MUSEUM FOR HIS DREAMING SPIRIT ALREADY AS A CHILD AS A BOY HE HAD FELT THAT PASSION FOR ANTIQUITY DEVELOPING HE LEARNT HOW TO RUMMAGE THROUGH THE STOCKS OF OLD JEWISH DEALERS
8425-287387-0004 HE SPENT ALL HIS POCKET MONEY ON IT AND LATER WITHOUT RESERVE THE LITTLE THAT HE WAS ABLE TO EARN FOR SOMETIMES VERY SELDOM HE WOULD FINISH SOMETHING AND SELL IT
8425-287387-0005 WHEN HE HAD THE MONEY TO KEEP HIMSELF GOING AND HIS PERSONAL NEEDS WERE VERY SMALL HE FELT RICH AND WAS CONTENT IN HIS STUDIO OR WOULD WANDER PERFECTLY CONTENT THROUGH THE STREETS OF ROME
8425-287387-0006 AND HIS FAVOURITE HEADGEAR WAS A FADED HAT BATTERED OUT OF SHAPE BY THE RAIN
8425-287387-0007 HE WOULD WANDER FOR HOURS THROUGH THE RUINS AND SEE IN A DAZZLING VISION OF PHANTOM COLUMNS ETHEREAL TEMPLES AND TRANSLUCENT MARBLE PALACES LOOMING UP IN A SHIMMERING SUNLIT TWILIGHT AND THE TOURISTS GOING BY WITH THEIR BAEDEKERS
8425-287387-0008 WHO PASSED THIS LONG LEAN YOUNG MAN SEATED CARELESSLY ON THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE TEMPLE OF SATURN WOULD NEVER HAVE BELIEVED IN HIS ARCHITECTURAL ILLUSIONS OF HARMONIOUS ASCENDING LINES CROWNED BY AN ARRAY OF STATUES IN NOBLE
8425-287387-0009 AND GOD LIKE ATTITUDES HIGH IN THE BLUE SKY BUT HE SAW THEM BEFORE HIM HE RAISED THE SHAFTS OF THE PILLARS HE FLUTED THE SEVERE DORIC COLUMNS HE BENT AND CURVED THE CUSHIONED IONIC CAPITALS
8425-287387-0010 THE TEMPLES ROSE IN THE TWINKLING OF AN EYE THE BASILICAS SHOT UP AS BY MAGIC THE GRAVEN IMAGES STOOD WHITE AGAINST THE ELUSIVE DEPTHS OF THE SKY AND THE VIA SACRA BECAME ALIVE
8425-287387-0011 HE IN HIS ADMIRATION LIVED HIS DREAM HIS PAST IT WAS AS THOUGH HE HAD KNOWN PREEXISTENCE IN ANCIENT ROME AND THE MODERN HOUSES THE MODERN CAPITOL
8425-287387-0012 ROMAN LIFE CAME INTO BEING WITH A TOGA'D GESTURE A LINE OF HORACE A SUDDEN VISION OF AN EMPEROR'S MURDER
8425-287387-0013 EATEN UP WITH AGE CRUMBLED MARTYRED MUTILATED WITH HAMMERS TILL ONLY A FEW OCCASIONAL PILLARS LIFTED AND BORE A TREMBLING ARCHITRAVE THAT THREATENED TO COME CRASHING TO THE GROUND
8425-287387-0014 AND THE BROWNS AND GREYS WERE SO RICHLY AND NOBLY GILDED BY SPLASHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RUINS WERE SO EXQUISITELY BEAUTIFUL IN DECAY SO MELANCHOLY IN THEIR UNWITTING FORTUITOUSNESS OF BROKEN LINES
8425-287387-0015 AND CAUSED THEM TO BURST ASUNDER AND SHAKE AND TREMBLE FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR WISTFUL AFTERMATH OF BEAUTY THEN HIS EYES GREW MOIST HIS HEART BECAME MORE FULL THAN HE COULD BEAR
8425-287387-0016 AND HE WENT AWAY THROUGH THE ARCH OF TITUS BY THE COLOSSEUM THROUGH THE ARCH OF CONSTANTINE
8425-287387-0017 NEITHER IN HIS MOTHER NOR IN HIS SISTERS DID HE FIND A STRAIN THAT SYMPATHIZED WITH HIS ECCENTRIC TENDENCIES AND SINCE THAT ONE FRIEND WHO DIED HE HAD NEVER FOUND ANOTHER AND HAD ALWAYS BEEN LONELY WITHIN
8425-287387-0018 AND WITHOUT AS THOUGH THE VICTIM OF A PREDESTINATION WHICH WOULD NOT ALLOW HIM TO MEET WITH SYMPATHY BUT HE HAD PEOPLED HIS LONELINESS SO DENSELY WITH HIS DREAMS THAT HE HAD NEVER FELT UNHAPPY BECAUSE OF IT
8425-287387-0019 AND EVEN AS HE LOVED ROAMING ALONE AMONG THE RUINS AND ALONG THE COUNTRY ROADS SO HE CHERISHED THE PRIVACY OF HIS LONELY STUDIO WITH THE MANY SILENT FIGURES ON AN OLD PANEL OF SOME TRIPTYCH
8425-287387-0020 ON A TAPESTRY OR ON THE MANY CLOSELY HUNG SKETCHES ALL AROUND HIM ALL WITH THE CHARM OF THEIR LINES
8425-287387-0021 OR A SHADOWY ANTIQUE CABINET AND IN BETWEEN ALL THIS LIVED HIS CHINA AND BRONZE AND OLD SILVER WHILE THE FADED GOLD EMBROIDERY OF AN ECCLESIASTICAL VESTMENT GLEAMED FAINTLY
8425-287387-0022 AND THE OLD LEATHER BINDINGS OF HIS BOOKS STOOD IN COMFORTABLE BROWN ROWS READY TO GIVE FORTH WHEN HIS HANDS OPENED THEM IMAGES WHICH MISTILY DRIFTED UPWARDS LIVING THEIR LOVES AND THEIR SORROWS IN THE TEMPERED BROWNS AND REDS AND GOLDS
8425-287387-0023 OF THE SOUNDLESS ATMOSPHERE OF THE STUDIO SUCH WAS HIS SIMPLE LIFE WITHOUT MUCH INWARD DOUBTING BECAUSE HE MADE NO GREAT DEMANDS UPON HIMSELF AND WITHOUT THE MODERN ARTIST'S MELANCHOLY
8425-287387-0024 BEING BY NATURE A LITTLE SHY OF BAEDEKERED TOURISTS OF SHORT SKIRTED ENGLISH LADIES WITH THEIR PERSISTENT LITTLE EXCLAMATIONS OF UNIFORM ADMIRATION AND FEELING ENTIRELY IMPOSSIBLE IN THE HALF ITALIAN
8425-287387-0025 HALF COSMOPOLITAN SET OF HIS RATHER WORLDLY MOTHER AND SMART LITTLE SISTERS WHO SPENT THEIR TIME DANCING AND CYCLING WITH YOUNG ITALIAN PRINCES AND DUKES
8425-287387-0026 AND AGAIN UNTIL IN HIS MUSING HE SEEMED TO HEAR IT ONCE MORE ON HER OWN LIPS UNTIL SHE JOINED THE BUSTS AND TORSOS IN HIS STUDIO AND APPEARED BEFORE HIM IN THE LILY LIKE FRAILNESS OF HER VISIBLE ACTUALITY
8425-287387-0027 AGAINST THE PRERAPHAELITE STIFFNESS OF LINE
8425-287387-0028 HIS LIFE HAD NEVER KNOWN MORE THAN THE NATURAL VIRILE IMPULSE AND THE ORDINARY LITTLE LOVE AFFAIR WITH A MODEL
8425-287387-0029 AND UNREAL BALANCE BETWEEN A WOMAN WHO SHOWED HERSELF IN THE NUDE FOR A FEW LIRE AND PETRARCH'S LAURA
8425-287387-0030 AND PREGNANT SENSE OF THE WORD AND WHEN HE BEGAN TO THINK AND TO THINK LONG AND OFTEN OF CORNELIE DE RETZ
8425-287387-0031 AND DREAMED FOR DAYS FOR A WEEK ABOUT A WOMAN IN A POEM
8425-287387-0032 NEVER AND THAT HE IRRITATED BY SOME OF HER SAYINGS HAD NEVERTHELESS SEEN HER STAND WITH HER LILY LIKE OUTLINE
8425-291444-0000 OF THIS VENERABLE AND ANCIENT CITY GRADUALLY SLIPPING FROM OUR GRASP TREMBLING ON THE LIPS OF NARRATIVE OLD AGE AND DAY BY DAY DROPPING PIECEMEAL INTO THE TOMB IN A LITTLE WHILE THOUGHT I AND THOSE REVERED DUTCH BURGHERS
8425-291444-0001 WHO SERVE AS THE TOTTERING MONUMENTS OF GOOD OLD TIMES WILL BE GATHERED TO THEIR FATHERS THEIR CHILDREN ENGROSSED BY THE EMPTY PLEASURES OR INSIGNIFICANT TRANSACTIONS OF THE PRESENT AGE WILL NEGLECT TO TREASURE UP THE RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PAST
8425-291444-0002 AND POSTERITY WILL SEARCH IN VAIN FOR MEMORIALS OF THE DAYS OF THE PATRIARCHS THE ORIGIN OF OUR CITY WILL BE BURIED IN ETERNAL OBLIVION AND EVEN THE NAMES AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF WOUTER VAN TWILLER
8425-291444-0003 STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THOUGH SUCH MULTITUDES OF EXCELLENT WORKS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN ABOUT THIS COUNTRY THERE ARE NONE EXTANT WHICH GIVE ANY FULL AND SATISFACTORY ACCOUNT OF THE EARLY HISTORY OF NEW YORK
8425-291444-0004 OR OF ITS THREE FIRST DUTCH GOVERNORS I HAVE HOWEVER GAINED MUCH VALUABLE AND CURIOUS MATTER FROM AN ELABORATE MANUSCRIPT WRITTEN
8425-291444-0005 EXCEPTING A FEW ERRORS IN ORTHOGRAPHY WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE ARCHIVES OF THE STUYVESANT FAMILY MANY LEGENDS LETTERS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS HAVE I LIKEWISE GLEANED IN MY RESEARCHES AMONG THE FAMILY CHESTS AND LUMBER GARRETS OF OUR RESPECTABLE
8425-291444-0006 BY THAT ADMIRABLE AND PRAISEWORTHY INSTITUTION THE NEW YORK HISTORICAL SOCIETY TO WHICH I HERE PUBLICLY RETURN MY SINCERE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IN THE CONDUCT OF THIS INESTIMABLE WORK I HAVE ADOPTED NO INDIVIDUAL MODEL
8425-291444-0007 AND THE STRICTEST ADHERENCE TO TRUTH THROUGHOUT MY HISTORY I HAVE ENRICHED IT AFTER THE MANNER OF SALLUST WITH VARIOUS CHARACTERS OF ANCIENT WORTHIES DRAWN AT FULL LENGTH AND FAITHFULLY COLORED
8425-291444-0008 SWEETENED IT WITH THE GRACES OF SENTIMENT LIKE TACITUS AND INFUSED INTO THE WHOLE THE DIGNITY THE GRANDEUR AND MAGNIFICENCE OF LIVY I AM AWARE THAT I SHALL INCUR THE CENSURE OF NUMEROUS VERY LEARNED AND JUDICIOUS CRITICS FOR
8425-291444-0009 OF THE HISTORIAN AND ENTICE HIM TO TURN ASIDE AND REFRESH HIMSELF FROM HIS WAYFARING BUT I TRUST IT WILL BE FOUND THAT I HAVE ALWAYS RESUMED MY STAFF AND ADDRESSED MYSELF TO MY WEARY JOURNEY WITH RENOVATED SPIRITS
8425-291444-0010 YET THE LOOSE AND UNCONNECTED MANNER IN WHICH MANY OF THE FACTS HEREIN RECORDED HAVE COME TO HAND RENDERED SUCH AN ATTEMPT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THIS DIFFICULTY WAS LIKEWISE INCREASED BY ONE OF THE GRAND OBJECTS CONTEMPLATED IN MY WORK
8425-291444-0011 BUT THE CHIEF MERIT ON WHICH I VALUE MYSELF AND FOUND MY HOPES FOR FUTURE REGARD IS THAT FAITHFUL VERACITY WITH WHICH I HAVE COMPILED THIS INVALUABLE LITTLE WORK
8425-291444-0012 CAREFULLY WINNOWING AWAY THE CHAFF OF HYPOTHESIS AND DISCARDING THE TARES OF FABLE WHICH ARE TOO APT TO SPRING UP AND CHOKE THE SEEDS OF TRUTH AND WHOLESOME KNOWLEDGE HAD I BEEN ANXIOUS TO CAPTIVATE THE SUPERFICIAL THRONG
8425-291444-0013 THE INFANT YEARS OF OUR CITY TO INTRODUCE A THOUSAND PLEASING FICTIONS BUT I HAVE SCRUPULOUSLY DISCARDED MANY A PITHY TALE AND MARVELOUS ADVENTURE WHEREBY THE DROWSY EAR OF SUMMER INDOLENCE MIGHT BE ENTHRALLED
8425-291444-0014 JEALOUSLY MAINTAINING THAT FIDELITY GRAVITY AND DIGNITY WHICH SHOULD EVER DISTINGUISH THE HISTORIAN FOR A WRITER OF THIS CLASS OBSERVES AN ELEGANT CRITIC MUST SUSTAIN THE CHARACTER OF A WISE MAN WRITING FOR THE INSTRUCTION OF POSTERITY
8425-291444-0015 TO DECAY WHO GATHERS TOGETHER THEIR SCATTERED FRAGMENTS AS THEY ROT AND WHO PIOUSLY AT LENGTH COLLECTS THEIR ASHES INTO THE MAUSOLEUM OF HIS WORK AND REARS A TRIUMPHANT MONUMENT
8425-291444-0016 TO TRANSMIT THEIR RENOWN TO ALL SUCCEEDING AGES WHAT HAS BEEN THE FATE OF MANY FAIR CITIES OF ANTIQUITY WHOSE NAMELESS RUINS ENCUMBER THE PLAINS OF EUROPE AND ASIA AND AWAKEN THE FRUITLESS INQUIRY OF THE TRAVELER
8425-291444-0017 THEY HAVE PERISHED FROM REMEMBRANCE FOR WANT OF A HISTORIAN THE PHILANTHROPIST MAY WEEP OVER THEIR DESOLATION THE POET MAY WANDER AMONG THEIR MOULDERING ARCHES AND BROKEN COLUMNS
8425-291444-0018 AND INDULGE THE VISIONARY FLIGHTS OF HIS FANCY BUT ALAS ALAS THE MODERN HISTORIAN WHOSE PEN LIKE MY OWN IS DOOMED TO CONFINE ITSELF TO DULL MATTER OF FACT
8425-291444-0019 REUNITE THE THREAD OF GENERATIONS THE SAME SAD MISFORTUNE WHICH HAS HAPPENED TO SO MANY ANCIENT CITIES WILL HAPPEN AGAIN AND FROM THE SAME SAD CAUSE TO NINE TENTHS OF THOSE WHICH NOW FLOURISH ON THE FACE OF THE GLOBE
8425-292520-0000 THE BRIDGE THE LONELY BRIDGE CUTS DARK ACROSS THE MARSH
8425-292520-0001 PALELY REFLECTED IN THE AMBER COLORED WATER AMONG THEM A CONSTANT BANJO TWANGING OF FROGS AND SHRILLING
8425-292520-0002 DARK WITH CRUMBLING RAILING AND PLANKS THE BRIDGE LEADS INTO THE SUNSET ACROSS IT MANY LONELY FIGURES THEIR EYES A FLARE WITH THE SUNSET THEIR FACES GLOWING WITH ITS COLORS
8425-292520-0003 SALVATION ARMY A DRUM POUNDS OUT THE HYMN LOUD WITH GAUDY ANGELS TINSEL CHERUBIM TO DROWN THE FANFARE OF THE STREET AND WITH EXULTANT LILTING BEAT
8425-292520-0004 AND DINNING MARKET STALLS WHERE WOMEN SHOUT THEIR WARES AND MEAT HANGS OUT GROTESQUE DISTORTED BY THE GAS FLARE'S LIGHT INTO ONE SACRED RHYTHM FOR THE DEVIL'S SPITE A WOMAN'S THIN RAUCOUS VOICE CARRIES THE TUNE BIDS MEN REJOICE
8425-292520-0005 BATHE IN GOD'S MERCY DRAW NEAR AND LEARN SALVATION SEE WITH THEIR OWN EYES THE MYSTERY CYMBALS AT THE HANDS OF A TIRED GIRL SLIM WISP AMID THE SWIRL OF CROWDED STREETS TAKE UP THE TUNE
8425-292520-0006 FACES ARE WAN IN THE ARC LIGHT'S LIVID GLARE A WIND GUST CARRIES THE BAND'S FLARE OF SONG
8425-292520-0007 TILL WITH DISTANCE DIMMING IT FADES AWAY AMONG THE SILENT DARK ARRAY OF CITY HOUSES WHERE NO SOUL STIRS
8425-292520-0008 AS I GO HASTILY BY IN THE TURBULENT DARKNESS AN OVAL OLIVE FACE WITH THE SWEETLY SULLEN GRACE OF THE VIRGIN WHEN FIRST SHE SEES AMID HER GARDEN'S SILVER LILIES THE WHITE ROBED ANGEL GLEAM
8425-292520-0009 AN OLD ITALIAN PAINTER LABORIOUSLY HAS PLAYED HIS SOUL AWAY HIS LOVE ALL HIS DESIRE FOR FRAGRANT THINGS AFAR FROM EARTH SHINES THE MADONNA AS WITH A VEIL OVERLAID BY INCENSE SMOKE AND DUST AGE OLD
8425-292520-0010 AT WHOSE FEET IN TIME OF DEARTH OR NEED A MYRIAD MEN HAVE LAID THEIR SORROWS AND ARISEN BOLD INCESSANTLY THE LONG RAIN FALLS SLANTING ON BLACK WALLS BUT THROUGH THE DARK INTERMINABLE STREETS
8425-292520-0011 ALONG PAVEMENTS WHERE RAIN BEATS ITS SHARP TATTOO AND GAS LAMPS SHINE GREENISH GOLD IN THE SOLITUDE THE VISION FLAMES THROUGH MY MOOD OF THAT ITALIAN WOMAN'S FACE
8425-292520-0012 MEMORY BETWEEN ROUNDED HILLS WHITE WITH PATCHES OF BUCKWHEAT WHOSE FRAGRANCE FILLS THE LITTLE BREEZE THAT MAKES THE BIRCH LEAVES QUIVER BESIDE A ROLLICKING SWIFT RIVER
8425-292520-0013 LIGHT GREEN IN THE DEEPS LIKE YOUR EYES IN SUNSHINE WINDS THE CANAL LAZY AND BROWN AS A WATER SNAKE FULL OF DAZZLE AND SHEEN WHERE THE BREEZE SWEEPS THE WATER WITH GOSSAMER GARMENTS THAT SHAKE THE REEDS STANDING SENTINEL
8425-292520-0014 AND THE MARGINAL LINE OF BIRCHES AND WILLOWS OUR LITTLE STEAMER PULLS ITS WAY WITH JINGLE OF BELLS AND PANTING THROB OF OLD ENGINES IN STIFF ARRAY THE WATER REEDS WAVE AND SOLEMNLY SWAY TO THE WASH AND SWELL OF OUR PASSING
8425-292520-0015 AMONG THE REEDS THE RIPPLES SOB AND DIE AWAY TILL THE CANAL IS STILL AGAIN
8425-292520-0016 I STOOD BESIDE YOU IN THE BOW WATCHED THE SUNLIGHT LOSE ITSELF AMONG YOUR HAIR THAT THE BREEZE TUGGED AT BRIGHT AS THE SHATTERED SUN RAYS WHERE THE PROW CUT THE STILL WATER THE WARM LIGHT CAUGHT AND TANGLED THERE
8425-292520-0017 EDUCATION AGREED THAT UNLESS SOMETHING WERE CHANGED DISASTER WOULD COME TO THE NATION YOU SMILED WHEN I POINTED WHERE A GROUP OF BIRCHES SHIVERED IN THE GREEN WOOD SHADOW UP TO THEIR KNEES IN WATER
8425-292520-0018 WHITE AND FAIR AS DRYADS BATHING A ROW OF FLAT WHITE HOUSES AND A WHARF GLIDED IN SIGHT THE HOARSE WHISTLE SHRIEKED FOR A LANDING BELLS JANGLED
8425-292520-0019 THE LAKE WAVES WERE FLAKES OF RED GOLD BURNISHED TO COPPER GOLD RED AS THE TANGLED GLEAM OF SUNLIGHT IN YOUR HAIR SATURNALIA
8425-292520-0020 IN MEN'S HEARTS THE MAD GODS RISE AND FILL THE STREETS WITH REVELLING WITH TORCHLIGHT THAT GLANCES ON FROZEN POOLS WITH TAPERS STARRING THE THICK FOGGED NIGHT A DANCE LIKE STRAYED FIREFLIES
8425-292520-0021 TO EARTH'S BROOD OF SOULS OF OLD WITH COVERED HEADS AND ASPEN WANDS MIST SHROUDED PRIESTS DO ANCIENT RITES THE BLACK RAM'S FLEECE IS STAINED WITH BLOOD THAT STEAMS DULL RED ON THE FROZEN GROUND
8425-292520-0022 AND PALE VOTARIES SHIVER WITH THE COLD THAT NUMBS THE EARTH AND ETCHES PATTERNED MIRRORS ON THE PONDS WHAN THAT APRILLE
8425-292520-0023 IS IT THE SONG OF A MEADOW LARK OFF THE BROWN SERE SALT MARSHES OR THE EAGER PATCHES IN DOORYARDS OF YELLOW AND PALE LILAC CROCUSES
8425-292520-0024 RHYTHMED CLANK OF TRAIN COUPLINGS AT NIGHT AND THE STORMY GAY TINTED SUNRISES THAT SHADE WITH PURPLE THE CONTOURS OF FAR OFF UNFAMILIAR HILLS NIGHT PIECE
8425-292520-0025 A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB UPON ALL THE SKY WHERE THE FRAIL STARS QUIVER EVERY ONE LIKE TANGLED GNATS THAT HUM AND DIE
8425-292520-0026 THE MOON HAS TANGLED THE DULL NIGHT IN HER SILVER SKEIN AND SET ALIGHT EACH DEW DAMP BRANCH WITH MILKY FLAME AND HUGE THE MOON BROODS ON THE NIGHT MY SOUL IS CAUGHT IN THE WEB OF THE MOON
8425-292520-0027 BEHIND THOSE WALLS IN THOSE DARK STREETS LIKE THE SOUND OF A RIVER SWIFT UNSEEN FLOWING IN DARKNESS OH THE HOARSE HALF HEARD MURMUR SWIRLING BENEATH THE SNOWY BEAUTY OF MOONLIGHT
8425-292520-0028 LOW A GREY MOON SHROUDED IN SEA FOG AIR PREGNANT WITH SPRING RASP OF MY STEPS BESIDE THE LAPPING WATER WITHIN THE DARK
8425-292520-0029 DOWN THE WORN OUT YEARS A SOB OF BROKEN LOVES OLD PAIN OF DEAD FAREWELLS AND ONE FACE FADING INTO GREY A SILVER WEB HAS THE MOON SPUN A SILVER WEB OVER ALL THE SKY
8465-246940-0000 IT WAS SOME MOMENTS BEFORE EITHER OF THEM SPOKE AND IT DID NOT HELP WINGFOLD THAT SHE SAT CLOUDED BY A DARK COLOURED VEIL AT LENGTH HE SAID YOU MUST NOT FEAR TO TRUST ME BECAUSE I DOUBT MY ABILITY TO HELP YOU I CAN AT LEAST ASSURE YOU OF MY SYMPATHY
8465-246940-0001 CAN YOU TELL ME SHE SAID FROM BEHIND MORE VEILS THAN THAT OF LACE HOW TO GET RID OF A HAUNTING IDEA THAT DEPENDS ON THE NATURE OF THE IDEA I SHOULD IMAGINE ANSWERED THE CURATE SUCH THINGS SOMETIMES ARISE MERELY FROM THE STATE OF THE HEALTH
8465-246940-0002 AND THERE THE DOCTOR IS THE BEST HELP HELEN SHOOK HER HEAD AND SMILED BEHIND HER VEIL A GRIEVOUS SMILE THE CURATE PAUSED BUT RECEIVING NO ASSISTANCE VENTURED ON AGAIN IF IT BE A THOUGHT OF SOMETHING PAST AND GONE
8465-246940-0003 FOR WHICH NOTHING CAN BE DONE I THINK ACTIVITY IN ONE'S DAILY WORK MUST BE THE BEST AID TO ENDURANCE OH DEAR OH DEAR SIGHED HELEN WHEN ONE HAS NO HEART TO ENDURE AND HATES THE VERY SUNLIGHT
8465-246940-0004 YOU WOULDN'T TALK ABOUT WORK TO A MAN DYING OF HUNGER WOULD YOU I'M NOT SURE ABOUT THAT HE WOULDN'T HEED YOU PERHAPS NOT WHAT WOULD YOU DO THEN GIVE HIM SOME FOOD AND TRY HIM AGAIN I THINK
8465-246940-0005 THEN GIVE ME SOME FOOD SOME HOPE I MEAN AND TRY ME AGAIN WITHOUT THAT I DON'T CARE ABOUT DUTY OR LIFE OR ANYTHING TELL ME THEN WHAT IS THE MATTER
8465-246940-0006 I MAY BE ABLE TO HINT AT SOME HOPE SAID WINGFOLD VERY GENTLY DO YOU CALL YOURSELF A CHRISTIAN THE QUESTION WOULD TO MOST PEOPLE HAVE SOUNDED STRANGE ABRUPT INQUISITORIAL BUT TO HELEN IT SOUNDED NOT ONE OF THEM ALL
8465-246940-0007 NO SHE ANSWERED AH SAID THE CURATE A LITTLE SADLY AND WENT ON BECAUSE THEN I COULD HAVE SAID YOU KNOW WHERE TO GO FOR COMFORT
8465-246940-0008 MIGHT IT NOT BE WELL HOWEVER TO TRY IF THERE IS ANY TO BE HAD FROM HIM THAT SAID COME UNTO ME AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST I CAN DO NOTHING WITH THAT I HAVE TRIED AND TRIED TO PRAY BUT IT IS OF NO USE
8465-246940-0009 I SUPPOSE IT IS BECAUSE I CANNOT BELIEVE THERE IS ANYONE HEARING A WORD I SAY YESTERDAY WHEN I GOT ALONE IN THE PARK I PRAYED ALOUD
8465-246940-0010 I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS EVEN IF HE MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO READ WHAT WAS IN MY HEART HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO HEAR MY VOICE I WAS EVEN FOOLISH ENOUGH TO WISH I KNEW GREEK BECAUSE PERHAPS HE WOULD UNDERSTAND ME BETTER IF I WERE TO PRAY IN GREEK
8465-246940-0011 SHE TRIED HARD BUT COULD NOT PREVENT A SOB
8465-246940-0012 WILL YOU NOT TELL ME SOMETHING ABOUT IT SAID THE CURATE YET MORE GENTLY
8465-246940-0013 HIS HELP MAY BE ON THE WAY TO YOU OR EVEN WITH YOU ONLY YOU DO NOT RECOGNIZE IT FOR WHAT IT IS I HAVE KNOWN THAT KIND OF THING TELL ME SOME FACT OR SOME FEELING I CAN LAY HOLD OF
8465-246940-0014 POSSIBLY THERE IS SOMETHING YOU OUGHT TO DO AND ARE NOT DOING AND THAT IS WHY YOU CANNOT REST I THINK JESUS WOULD GIVE NO REST EXCEPT IN THE WAY OF LEARNING OF HIM HELEN'S SOBS CEASED
8465-246940-0015 BUT WHAT APPEARED TO THE CURATE A LONG SILENCE FOLLOWED AT LENGTH SHE SAID WITH FALTERING VOICE SUPPOSE IT WERE A GREAT WRONG THAT HAD BEEN DONE AND THAT WAS THE UNENDURABLE THOUGHT SUPPOSE I SAY
8465-246940-0016 THAT WAS WHAT MADE ME MISERABLE THEN YOU MUST OF COURSE MAKE ALL POSSIBLE REPARATION ANSWERED WINGFOLD AT ONCE BUT IF NONE WERE POSSIBLE WHAT THEN
8465-246940-0017 HERE THE ANSWER WAS NOT SO PLAIN AND THE CURATE HAD TO THINK AT LEAST HE SAID AT LENGTH YOU COULD CONFESS THE WRONG AND ASK FORGIVENESS
8465-246940-0018 AGAIN THE CURATE TOOK TIME TO REPLY I AM ENDEAVOURING TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AS WELL AS I CAN HE SAID BUT IT IS HARD TO DEAL WITH GENERALITIES
8465-246940-0019 YOU SEE HOW USELESS FOR THAT VERY REASON MY ANSWERS HAVE AS YET BEEN STILL I HAVE SOMETHING MORE TO SAY AND HESITATE ONLY BECAUSE IT MAY IMPLY MORE CONFIDENCE THAN I DARE PROFESS AND OF ALL THINGS I DREAD UNTRUTH
8465-246940-0020 FOR SURELY THERE CANNOT BE ANY OTHER KIND OF GOD THAN THE FATHER OF JESUS CHRIST
8465-246940-0021 THEREFORE SURELY THE FIRST STEP FOR ANYONE WHO HAS COMMITTED SUCH A CRIME MUST BE TO HUMBLE HIMSELF BEFORE GOD CONFESS THE SIN AND ASK FORGIVENESS AND CLEANSING
8465-246940-0022 AND THE CREATURE HE HAS MADE AND IF GOD HEARD THE MAN'S PRAYER AND FORGAVE HIM THEN THE MAN WOULD CERTAINLY KNOW IT IN HIS HEART AND BE CONSOLED PERHAPS BY THE GIFT OF HUMILITY
8465-246940-0023 THEN YOU THINK CONFESSION TO GOD IS ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IF THERE BE NO ONE ELSE WRONGED TO WHOM CONFESSION CAN BE MADE IF THE CASE WERE MINE
8465-246940-0024 AND SOMETIMES I MUCH FEAR THAT IN TAKING HOLY ORDERS I HAVE GRIEVOUSLY SINNED I SHOULD THEN DO JUST AS I HAVE DONE WITH REGARD TO THAT CRY TO THE LIVING POWER WHICH I THINK ORIGINATED ME TO SET THE MATTER RIGHT FOR ME
8465-246940-0025 THEN TO FORGIVE AND CONSOLE ME ALAS ALAS THAT HE WILL NOT HEAR OF HE WOULD RATHER BE PUNISHED THAN CONSOLED I FEAR FOR HIS BRAIN BUT INDEED THAT MIGHT BE WELL
8465-246940-0026 SHE HAD GONE MUCH FARTHER THAN SHE HAD INTENDED BUT THE MORE DOUBTFUL HELP BECAME THE MORE SHE WAS DRIVEN BY THE AGONY OF A PERISHING HOPE TO SEARCH THE HEART OF WINGFOLD AGAIN THE CURATE PONDERED ARE YOU SURE HE SAID AT LENGTH
8465-246940-0027 THAT THE PERSON OF WHOM YOU SPEAK IS NOT NEGLECTING SOMETHING HE OUGHT TO DO SOMETHING HE KNOWS PERHAPS HE HAD COME BACK TO THE SAME WITH WHICH HE STARTED THROUGH HER VEIL HE SAW HER TURN DEADLY WHITE
8465-246940-0028 EVER SINCE LEOPOLD SAID THE WORD JURY A GHASTLY FEAR HAD HAUNTED HELEN SHE PRESSED HER HAND ON HER HEART AND MADE NO ANSWER I SPEAK FROM EXPERIENCE THE CURATE WENT ON FROM WHAT ELSE COULD I SPEAK
8465-246940-0029 I KNOW THAT SO LONG AS WE HANG BACK FROM DOING WHAT CONSCIENCE URGES THERE IS NO PEACE FOR US I WILL NOT SAY OUR PRAYERS ARE NOT HEARD FOR MISTER POLWARTH HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THE MOST PRECIOUS ANSWER PRAYER CAN HAVE
8465-246940-0030 LIES IN THE GROWING STRENGTH OF THE IMPULSE TOWARDS THE DREADED DUTY AND IN THE EVER SHARPER STINGS OF THE CONSCIENCE I THINK I ASKED ALREADY WHETHER THERE WERE NO RELATIVES TO WHOM REPARATION COULD BE MADE YES YES GASPED HELEN
8465-246940-0031 AND I TOLD YOU REPARATION WAS IMPOSSIBLE HER VOICE HAD SUNK ALMOST TO A GROAN
8465-246942-0000 SHE HAD SOUGHT THE DOOR OF PARADISE AND THE DOOR OF HELL HAD BEEN OPENED TO HER IF THE FRIGHTFUL IDEA WHICH SHE DID NOT DOUBT HAD ALREADY SUGGESTED ITSELF TO LEOPOLD SHOULD NOW BE ENCOURAGED THERE WAS NOTHING BUT BLACK MADNESS BEFORE HER
8465-246942-0001 HER POLDIE ON THE SCAFFOLD GOD IN HEAVEN INFINITELY RATHER WOULD SHE POISON HERSELF AND HIM THEN SHE REMEMBERED HOW PLEASED AND CONSOLED HE HAD BEEN WHEN SHE SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THEIR DYING TOGETHER AND THAT REASSURED HER A LITTLE
8465-246942-0002 BUT SHE MUST TAKE CARE THAT FOOLISH EXTRAVAGANT CURATE SHOULD NOT COME NEAR HIM THERE WAS NO KNOWING TO WHAT HE MIGHT PERSUADE HIM POOR POLDIE WAS SO EASILY LED BY ANY SHOW OF NOBILITY ANYTHING THAT LOOKED GRAND OR SELF SACRIFICING
8465-246942-0003 HELEN'S ONLY KNOWLEDGE OF GUILT CAME FROM THE PALE IMAGE OF IT LIFTED ABOVE HER HORIZON BY THE REFRACTION OF HER SYMPATHY SHE DID NOT KNOW PERHAPS NEVER WOULD UNDERSTAND THE GHASTLY HORROR OF CONSCIOUS GUILT BESIDES WHICH THERE IS NO EVIL ELSE
8465-246942-0004 AGONIES OF INJURY A MAN MAY ENDURE AND SO FAR FROM BEING OVERWHELMED RISE ABOVE THEM TENFOLD A MAN WHO WERE HE TO AWAKE TO THE SELF KNOWLEDGE OF A CRIME WOULD SINK INTO A HEAP OF RUIN
8465-246942-0005 THEN INDEED IF THERE BE NO GOD OR ONE THAT HAS NOT AN INFINITE POWER OF SETTING RIGHT THAT WHICH HAS GONE WRONG WITH HIS WORK THEN INDEED WELCOME THE FAITH FOR FAITH IT MAY THEN BE CALLED OF SUCH AS SAY THERE IS NO HEREAFTER
8465-246942-0006 HELEN DID NOT KNOW TO WHAT GULFS OF PERSONAL SHAME NAY TO WHAT SUMMITS OF PUBLIC EXECRATION A MAN MAY BE GLAD TO FLEE FOR REFUGE FROM THE FANGS OF HOME BORN GUILT IF SO BE THERE IS ANY REFUGE TO BE FOUND IN EITHER
8465-246942-0007 AND SOME KIND OF REFUGE THERE DOES SEEM TO BE STRANGE IT IS AND TRUE THAT IN PUBLICITY ITSELF LIES SOME RELIEF FROM THE GNAWING OF THE WORM AS IF EVEN A CURSING HUMANITY WERE A BARRIER OF PROTECTION BETWEEN THE TORN SOUL AND ITS CRIME
8465-246942-0008 IT FLEES TO ITS KIND FOR SHELTER FROM ITSELF HENCE I IMAGINE IN PART MAY THE COOLNESS OF SOME CRIMINALS BE ACCOUNTED FOR THEIR QUIETNESS IS THE RELIEF BROUGHT BY CONFESSION EVEN CONFESSION BUT TO THEIR FELLOWS
8465-246942-0009 IS IT THAT THE CRIME SEEMS THEN LIFTED A LITTLE FROM THEIR SHOULDERS AND ITS WEIGHT SHARED BY THE ACE HELEN HAD HOPED THAT THE MAN WHO HAD SPOKEN IN PUBLIC SO TENDERLY AND AT THE SAME TIME SO POWERFULLY OF THE SAVING HEART OF THE UNIVERSE
8465-246942-0010 THAT WOULD HAVE NO DIVISIONS OF PRIDE NO SCATTERINGS OF HATE
8465-246942-0011 WHICH SHE MIGHT HAVE CARRIED HOME IN GLADNESS TO HER SICK SOULED BROTHER TO COMFORT AND STRENGTHEN HIM
8465-246942-0012 AND MAKE HIM FEEL THAT AFTER ALL THERE WAS YET A PLACE FOR HIM IN THE UNIVERSE AND THAT HE WAS NO OUTCAST OF GEHENNA BUT INSTEAD OF SUCH WORDS OF GENTLE MIGHT LIKE THOSE OF THE MAN OF WHOM HE WAS SO FOND OF TALKING
8465-246942-0013 HE HAD ONLY SPOKEN DREARILY OF DUTY HINTING AT A HORROR THAT WOULD PLUNGE THE WHOLE ANCIENT FAMILY INTO A HELL OF DISHONOUR AND CONTEMPT
8465-246942-0014 SKELETONS THEY WERE AND NO HUMAN BEINGS AT ALL HER FATHER
8465-246942-0015 IF LEOPOLD HAD HAD HER MOTHER FOR HIS TOO INSTEAD OF THE DARK SKINNED WOMAN WITH THE FLASHING EYES HE WOULD NEVER HAVE BROUGHT THIS UPON THEM IT WAS ALL HIS MOTHER'S FAULT THE FAULT OF HER RACE AND OF THE HORRIBLE DRUG HER PEOPLE HAD TAUGHT HIM TO TAKE
8465-246942-0016 AND WAS HE TO GO AND CONFESS IT AND BE TRIED FOR IT AND BE GREAT GOD AND HERE WAS THE PRIEST ACTUALLY COUNSELLING WHAT WAS WORSE THAN ANY SUICIDE
8465-246942-0017 SUDDENLY HOWEVER IT OCCURRED TO HER THAT THE CURATE HAD HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AND HAD THEREFORE BEEN COMPELLED TO TALK AT RANDOM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE HE SHOULD SUSPECT THE CRIME OF WHICH HER BROTHER HAD BEEN GUILTY
8465-246942-0018 AND THEREFORE COULD NOT KNOW THE FRIGHTFUL CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH A CONFESSION AS HE HAD COUNSELLED HAD SHE NOT BETTER THEN TELL HIM ALL AND SO GATHER FROM HIM SOME RIGHT AND REASONABLE ADVICE FOR THE SOOTHING OF THE AGONIES OF HER POOR BROKEN WINGED ANGEL
8465-246942-0019 BUT ALAS WHAT SECURITY HAD SHE THAT A MAN CAPABLE OF SUCH PRIESTLY SEVEIRITY AND HEARTLESSNESS
8465-246942-0020 NO SHE WOULD VENTURE NO FARTHER SOONER WOULD SHE GO TO GEORGE BASCOMBE FROM WHOM SHE NOT ONLY COULD LOOK FOR NO SPIRITUAL COMFORT BUT WHOSE THEORIES WERE SO CRUEL AGAINST CULPRITS OF ALL SORTS
8465-246942-0021 ALAS ALAS SHE WAS ALONE ABSOLUTELY ALONE IN THE GREAT WASTE DEATH EYED UNIVERSE BUT FOR A MAN TO TALK SO OF THE TENDERNESS OF JESUS CHRIST
8465-246942-0022 AND THEN SERVE HER AS THE CURATE HAD DONE IT WAS INDEED SHAMELESS HE WOULD NEVER HAVE TREATED A POOR WRETCHED WOMAN LIKE THAT AND AS SHE SAID THUS TO HERSELF AGAIN THE WORDS SOUNDED IN THE EAR OF HER HEART
8465-246942-0023 COME UNTO ME ALL YE THAT LABOUR AND ARE HEAVY LADEN AND I WILL GIVE YOU REST WHENCE CAME THE VOICE FROM HER MEMORY OR FROM THAT INNER CHAMBER OF THE SPIRIT WHICH THE ONE SPIRIT BEARING SPIRIT
8465-246942-0024 KEEPS FOR HIS OWN IN EVERY HOUSE THAT HE BUILDS ALAS SO LONG IN MOST HUMAN HOUSES SHUT AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE ROOMS AND FORGOTTEN OR RECOLLECTED WITH UNEASINESS AS A LUMBER CLOSET IN WHICH LIE TOO MANY THINGS THAT HAD BETTER NOT BE LOOKED INTO
8465-246942-0025 BUT WHAT MATTER WHERE THE VOICE THAT HAD SAID THEM SO LONG AS THE WORDS WERE TRUE AND SHE MIGHT BELIEVE THEM WHATEVER IS TRUE CAN BE BELIEVED OF THE TRUE HEART ERE SHE KNEW
8465-246942-0026 HELEN WAS ON HER KNEES WITH HER HEAD ON THE CHAIR YET ONCE MORE CRYING TO THE HEARER OF CRIES POSSIBLE OR IMPOSSIBLE BEING SHE KNEW NOT IN THE LEAST BUT WORDS REPORTED OF HIM HAD GIVEN BIRTH TO THE CRY TO HELP HER IN HER DIRE NEED
8465-246942-0027 INSTEAD OF ANY WORD OR THOUGHT EVEN COMING TO HER THAT MIGHT BE FANCIED AN ANSWER SHE WAS SCARED FROM HER KNEES BY AN APPROACHING STEP
8465-246943-0000 HELEN ROSE AND HASTENED TO HER BROTHER WITH A HEART OF LEAD IN HER BODY SHE STARTED WHEN SHE SAW HIM SOME CHANGE HAD PASSED ON HIM SINCE THE MORNING
8465-246943-0001 THAT GLIMMER ON HIS COUNTENANCE DOUBTFUL AS THE FIRST OF THE MORNING WHEN THE TRAVELLER KNOWS NOT WHETHER THE LIGHT BE IN THE SKY OR ONLY IN HIS BRAIN
8465-246943-0002 BUT AT THE SAME TIME HE APPEARED MORE WASTED AND PINCHED AND DEATH LIKE THAN SHE HAD YET SEEN HIM OR WAS IT ONLY IN HER EYES WAS SHE BUT READING IN HIS FACE THE AGONY SHE HAD HERSELF GONE THROUGH THAT DAY HELEN HELEN HE CRIED AS SHE ENTERED THE ROOM
8465-246943-0003 WHAT WAS THAT POLDIE ASKED HELEN WITH A PANG OF FEAR WHY THOSE WORDS OF COURSE WHAT ELSE YOU SANG THEM TO ME AFTERWARDS YOU KNOW HELEN
8465-246943-0004 DON'T YOU THINK HE MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING
8465-246943-0005 WAS THIS WHAT CAME OF PRAYING SHE THOUGHT BITTERLY SOMETHING OR OTHER I DON'T KNOW WHAT EXACTLY RETURNED LEOPOLD OH HELEN HE BROKE OUT WITH A CRY STIFLED BY THE CAUTION THAT HAD GROWN HABITUAL TO BOTH OF THEM
8465-246943-0006 IS THERE NO HELP OF ANY KIND ANYWHERE SURELY MISTER WINGFOLD COULD TELL ME SOMETHING COMFORT ME SOMEHOW IF I WERE TO TELL HIM ALL ABOUT IT I COULD TRUST THE MAN THAT SAID SUCH THINGS AS THOSE YOU TOLD ME THAT I COULD
8465-246943-0007 OH I WISH I HADN'T RUN AWAY BUT HAD LET THEM TAKE ME AND HANG ME HELEN FELT HERSELF GROW WHITE SHE TURNED AWAY AND PRETENDED TO SEARCH FOR SOMETHING SHE HAD DROPPED
8465-246943-0008 I DON'T THINK HE WOULD BE OF THE SLIGHTEST USE TO YOU SHE SAID STILL STOOPING AND SHE FELT LIKE A DEVIL DRAGGING THE SOUL OF HER BROTHER TO HELL BUT THAT WAS A FOOLISH FANCY AND MUST BE RESISTED
8465-246943-0009 NOT IF I TOLD HIM EVERYTHING LEOPOLD HISSED FROM BETWEEN HIS TEETH IN THE STRUGGLE TO KEEP DOWN A SHRIEK NO NOT IF YOU TOLD HIM EVERYTHING SHE ANSWERED AND FELT LIKE A JUDGE CONDEMNING HIM TO DEATH
8465-246943-0010 WHAT IS HE THERE FOR THEN SAID LEOPOLD INDIGNANTLY AND TURNED HIS FACE TO THE WALL AND MOANED HELEN HAD NOT YET THOUGHT OF ASKING HERSELF WHETHER HER LOVE TO HER BROTHER WAS ALL CLEAR LOVE AND NOWISE MINGLED WITH SELFISHNESS
8465-246943-0011 WHETHER IN THE FRESH HORROR THAT DAY POURED INTO THE CUP THAT HAD SEEMED ALREADY RUNNING OVER IT WAS OF HER BROTHER ONLY SHE THOUGHT OR WHETHER THREATENED SHAME TO HERSELF HAD NOT A PART IN HER MISERY
8465-246943-0012 FOR WHAT ATTEMPT EVEN HAD HE MADE TO COMFORT HER WHAT HAD HE DONE BUT UTTER COMMON PLACES AND TRUISMS ABOUT DUTY AND WHO COULD TELL BUT
8465-246943-0013 INDEED WAS SHE NOT CERTAIN THAT SUCH A MAN BRINGING THE ARTILLERY OF HIS FANATICISM TO BEAR UPON HER POOR BOY'S WILD ENTHUSIASTIC TEMPERAMENT WOULD SPEEDILY PERSUADE HIM TO MAKE A REALITY OF THAT TERRIBLE THING HE HAD ALREADY THOUGHT OF THAT HIDEOUSLY IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBILITY
8465-246943-0014 IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN LONG SHE THOUGHT
8465-246943-0015 APPARENTLY SENSELESS ON THE PILLOW AND SHE THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD THE SAME MOMENT SHE WAS FREE THE HORROR HAD DEPARTED FROM HER OWN ATMOSPHERE TOO AND SHE MADE HASTE TO RESTORE HIM
8465-246943-0016 BUT IN ALL SHE DID FOR HIM SHE FELT LIKE THE EXECUTIONER WHO GIVES RESTORATIVES TO THE WRETCH THAT HAS FAINTED ON THE RACK OR THE WHEEL WHAT RIGHT HAD SHE SHE THOUGHT TO MULTIPLY TO HIM HIS MOMENTS OF TORTURE
8465-246943-0017 IF THE CRUEL POWER THAT HAD CREATED HIM FOR SUCH MISERY WHOEVER WHATEVER WHEREVER HE MIGHT BE
8465-246943-0018 YET SHE HESITATED NOT A SINGLE MOMENT IN HER MINISTRATIONS THERE IS SO MUCH PASSES IN US OF WHICH OUR CONSCIOUSNESS TAKES NO GRASP OR BUT WITH SUCH A FLITTING TOUCH AS SCARCELY TO HAND IT OVER TO THE MEMORY
8465-246943-0019 THAT I FEEL ENCOURAGED TO DOUBT WHETHER EVER THERE WAS A MAN ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT HOPE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN ALAS ARE MANY WHO ARE AWARE OF NO GROUND OF HOPE NAY EVEN WHO FEEL NO GLIMMER IN THEM OF ANYTHING THEY CAN CALL HOPE I KNOW
8465-246943-0020 BUT I THINK IN THEM ALL IS AN UNDERLYING UNCONSCIOUS HOPE I THINK THAT NOT ONE IN ALL THE WORLD HAS MORE THAN A SHADOWY NOTION OF WHAT HOPELESSNESS MEANS PERHAPS UTTER HOPELESSNESS IS THE OUTER DARKNESS
8465-246943-0021 AT LENGTH LEOPOLD OPENED HIS EYES
8465-246943-0022 NONSENSE DEAR POLDIE IT WAS ALL FANCY NOTHING MORE SHE RETURNED IN A VOICE ALMOST AS HOLLOW AS HIS AND THE LIGHTNESS OF THE WORDS UTTERED IN SUCH A TONE JARRED DISMAYFULLY ON HER OWN EAR FANCY HE REPEATED
8465-246943-0023 I KNOW WHAT FANCY IS AS WELL AS ANY MAN OR WOMAN BORN THAT WAS NO FANCY SHE STOOD THERE BY THE WARDROBE IN THE SAME DRESS HER FACE AS WHITE AS HER DRESS AND LISTEN I WILL TELL YOU
8465-246943-0024 I WILL SOON SATISFY YOU IT COULD BE NO FANCY HERE HE PUSHED HER FROM HIM AND LOOKED STRAIGHT IN HER EYES I SAW HER BACK REFLECTED IN THE MIRROR OF THE WARDROBE DOOR AND
8465-246943-0025 HERE THE FIXED LOOK OF HORROR THREATENED TO RETURN UPON HIS FACE BUT HE WENT ON LISTEN
8465-246943-0026 UGH I SAW IT IN THE MIRROR HIS VOICE HAD RISEN TO A STRANGLED SHRIEK HIS FACE WAS DISTORTED
8465-246943-0027 IF INDEED THAT BE A POSSIBLE SOURCE OF COURAGE AND IT IS NOT GATHERED RATHER FROM THE HIDDEN HOPE OF WHICH I SPEAK AND THE LOVE THAT WILL CLEAVE AND NOT FORSAKE SHE SET HER TEETH AND SAID LET HER COME THEN POLDIE I AM WITH YOU AND I DEFY HER
8465-246943-0028 SHE SHALL KNOW THAT A SISTER'S LOVE IS STRONGER THAN THE HATE OF A JILT EVEN IF YOU DID KILL HER BEFORE GOD POLDIE I WOULD AFTER ALL RATHER BE YOU THAN SHE SAY WHAT YOU WILL
8465-246943-0029 BUT LEOPOLD SEEMED NOT TO HEAR A WORD SHE SAID AND LAY WITH HIS FACE TO THE WALL
8465-246947-0000 AS WINGFOLD CAME OUT OF THE ROOM WHICH WAS NEAR THE STAIR HELEN ROSE FROM THE TOP OF IT WHERE SHE HAD BEEN SITTING ALL THE TIME HE HAD BEEN WITH HER BROTHER HE CLOSED THE DOOR GENTLY BEHIND HIM AND STEPPED SOFTLY ALONG THE LANDING
8465-246947-0001 A HUMAN SOUL IN GUILT AND AGONY IS AN AWFUL PRESENCE BUT THERE WAS MORE THAN THAT IN THE HUSH OF THE CURATE HE FELT AS IF HE HAD LEFT THE PHYSICIAN OF SOULS BEHIND HIM AT THE BEDSIDE
8465-246947-0002 BUT AT HIS HEAD STOOD ONE WHO WATCHED HIS THROES WITH THE THROBS OF SUCH A HUMAN HEART AS NEVER BEAT IN ANY BOSOM BUT HIS OWN AND THE EXECUTIONERS WERE ANGELS OF LIGHT NO WONDER IF WITH SUCH A FEELING IN HIS BREAST WINGFOLD WALKED SOFTLY AND HIS FACE GLISTENED
8465-246947-0003 HE WAS NOT AWARE THAT THE TEARS STOOD IN HIS EYES BUT HELEN SAW THEM YOU KNOW ALL SHE FALTERED I DO WILL YOU LET ME OUT BY THE GARDEN AGAIN I WISH TO BE ALONE SHE LED THE WAY DOWN THE STAIR
8465-246947-0004 AND WALKED WITH HIM THROUGH THE GARDEN WINGFOLD DID NOT SPEAK YOU DON'T THINK VERY BADLY OF MY POOR BROTHER DO YOU MISTER WINGFOLD SAID HELEN MEEKLY IT IS A TERRIBLE FATE HE RETURNED
8465-246947-0005 I THINK I NEVER SAW A LOVELIER DISPOSITION I DO HOPE HIS MIND WILL SOON BE MORE COMPOSED I THINK HE KNOWS WHERE ALONE HE CAN FIND REST I AM WELL AWARE HOW FOOLISH THAT OF WHICH I SPEAK SEEMS TO SOME MINDS MISS LINGARD
8465-246947-0006 BUT WHEN A MAN IS ONCE OVERWHELMED IN HIS OWN DEEDS WHEN THEY HAVE TURNED INTO SPECTRES TO MOCK AT HIM WHEN HE LOATHES HIMSELF AND TURNS WITH SICKNESS FROM PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE I KNOW BUT ONE CHOICE LEFT
8465-246947-0007 INTO THE LIFE I HOPE YOUR BROTHER WILL ENTER I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T HATE HIM HATE HIM WHO BUT A DEMON COULD HATE HIM HELEN LIFTED A GRATEFUL LOOK FROM EYES THAT SWAM IN TEARS
8465-246947-0008 THE TERROR OF HIS POSSIBLE COUNSEL FOR THE MOMENT VANISHED HE COULD NEVER TELL HIM TO GIVE HIMSELF UP
8465-246947-0009 THE DWARF EXCLAIMED HELEN SHUDDERING AT THE REMEMBRANCE OF WHAT SHE HAD GONE THROUGH AT THE COTTAGE YES THAT MAN'S SOUL IS AS GRAND AND BEAUTIFUL AND PATIENT AS HIS BODY IS INSIGNIFICANT AND DISTORTED AND TROUBLED
8465-246947-0010 HE IS THE WISEST AND BEST MAN I HAVE EVER KNOWN I MUST ASK LEOPOLD RETURNED HELEN WHO THE BETTER THE MAN WAS REPRESENTED FELT THE MORE JEALOUS AND FEARFUL OF THE ADVICE HE MIGHT GIVE
8465-246947-0011 HER LOVE AND HER CONSCIENCE WERE NOT YET AT ONE WITH EACH OTHER THEY PARTED AT THE DOOR FROM THE GARDEN AND SHE RETURNED TO THE SICK ROOM SHE PAUSED HESITATING TO ENTER ALL WAS STILL AS THE GRAVE SHE TURNED THE HANDLE SOFTLY AND PEEPED IN
8465-246947-0012 COULD IT BE THAT WINGFOLD'S BEARING HAD COMMUNICATED TO HER MIND A SHADOW OF THE AWE WITH WHICH HE HAD LEFT THE PLACE WHERE PERHAPS A SOUL WAS BEING BORN AGAIN LEOPOLD DID NOT MOVE TERROR LAID HOLD OF HER HEART
8465-246947-0013 SHE STEPPED QUICKLY IN AND ROUND THE SCREEN TO THE SIDE OF THE BED THERE TO HER GLAD SURPRISE HE LAY FAST ASLEEP WITH THE TEARS NOT YET DRIED UPON HIS FACE HER HEART SWELLED WITH SOME SENSE UNKNOWN BEFORE
8465-246947-0014 WAS IT RUDIMENTARY THANKFULNESS TO THE FATHER OF HER SPIRIT AS SHE STOOD GAZING WITH THE LOOK OF A MOTHER OVER HER SICK CHILD HE LIFTED HIS EYELIDS AND SMILED A SAD SMILE WHEN DID YOU COME INTO THE ROOM HE SAID A MINUTE AGO SHE ANSWERED
8465-246947-0015 I DID NOT HEAR YOU HE RETURNED NO YOU WERE ASLEEP NOT I MISTER WINGFOLD IS ONLY JUST GONE I HAVE LET HIM OUT ON THE MEADOW SINCE LEOPOLD STARED LOOKED HALF ALARMED AND THEN SAID
8465-246947-0016 DID GOD MAKE ME SLEEP HELEN SHE DID NOT ANSWER THE LIGHT OF A NEW HOPE IN HIS EYE AS IF THE DAWN HAD BEGUN AT LAST TO BREAK OVER THE DARK MOUNTAINS WAS ALREADY REFLECTED FROM HER HEART OH HELEN HE SAID
8465-246947-0017 THAT IS A GOOD FELLOW SUCH A GOOD FELLOW A PANG OF JEALOUSY THE FIRST SHE HAD EVER FELT SHOT TO HER HEART SHE HAD HITHERTO SINCE HIS TROUBLE BEEN ALL IN ALL TO HER LEOPOLD
8465-246947-0018 HAD THE CURATE BEEN A MAN SHE LIKED SHE WOULD NOT PERHAPS HAVE MINDED IT SO MUCH YOU WILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT ME NOW SHE SAID SADLY I NEVER COULD UNDERSTAND TAKING TO PEOPLE AT FIRST SIGHT SOME PEOPLE ARE MADE SO I SUPPOSE HELEN
8465-246947-0019 I KNOW I TOOK TO YOU AT FIRST SIGHT I SHALL NEVER FORGET THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU WHEN I CAME TO THIS COUNTRY A LONELY LITTLE FOREIGNER AND YOU A GREAT BEAUTIFUL LADY FOR SUCH YOU SEEMED TO ME THOUGH YOU HAVE TOLD ME SINCE YOU WERE ONLY A GREAT GAWKY GIRL
8465-246947-0020 I KNOW THAT COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN YOU RAN TO MEET ME AND TOOK ME IN YOUR ARMS AND KISSED ME I WAS AS IF I HAD CROSSED THE SEA OF DEATH AND FOUND PARADISE IN YOUR BOSOM I AM NOT LIKELY TO FORGET YOU FOR MISTER WINGFOLD
8465-246947-0021 GOOD AND KIND AND STRONG AS HE IS EVEN SHE COULD NOT MAKE ME FORGET YOU HELEN BUT NEITHER YOU NOR I CAN DO WITHOUT MISTER WINGFOLD ANY MORE I FANCY I WISH YOU LIKED HIM BETTER
8465-246947-0022 BUT YOU WILL IN TIME YOU SEE HE'S NOT ONE TO PAY YOUNG LADIES COMPLIMENTS AS I HAVE HEARD SOME PARSONS DO AND HE MAY BE A LITTLE NO NOT UNPOLISHED NOT THAT THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEAN BUT UNORNAMENTAL IN HIS MANNERS
8465-246947-0023 YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT HIM THOUGH YOU NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE THAT IS TRUE RETURNED LEOPOLD BUT THEN HE CAME TO ME WITH HIS DOOR OPEN AND LET ME WALK IN
8465-246947-0024 HE HASN'T GOT A SECRET LIKE US HELEN HE ADDED SADLY WHAT DID HE SAY TO YOU MUCH WHAT HE SAID TO YOU FROM THE PULPIT THE OTHER DAY I SHOULD THINK THEN SHE WAS RIGHT FOR ALL HIS HARDNESS AND WANT OF SYMPATHY THE CURATE HAD YET HAD REGARD TO HER ENTREATIES
8465-246947-0025 AND WAS NOT GOING TO PUT ANY HORRID NOTIONS ABOUT DUTY AND SELF SACRIFICE INTO THE POOR BOY'S HEAD HE'S COMING AGAIN TO MORROW ADDED LEOPOLD ALMOST GLEEFULLY AND THEN PERHAPS HE WILL TELL ME MORE AND HELP ME ON A BIT DID HE TELL YOU HE WANTS TO BRING A FRIEND WITH HIM
8465-246947-0026 NO I CAN'T SEE THE GOOD OF TAKING MORE PEOPLE INTO OUR CONFIDENCE WHY SHOULD HE NOT DO WHAT HE THINKS BEST HELEN YOU DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE DOCTOR WHY SHOULD YOU WITH HIM WHEN A MAN IS GOING TO THE BOTTOM AS FAST AS HE CAN
8465-246947-0027 AND ANOTHER COMES DIVING AFTER HIM IT ISN'T FOR ME TO SAY HOW HE IS TO TAKE HOLD OF ME NO HELEN WHEN I TRUST I TRUST OUT AND OUT HELEN SIGHED THINKING HOW ILL THAT HAD WORKED WITH EMMELINE
8468-286673-0000 THE SLOW LITTLE MUD TURTLE WHEN THE TWENTY LITTLE MUD TURTLES BROKE THEIR EGG SHELLS ONE HOT SUMMER DAY AND POKED THEIR WAY UP THROUGH THE WARM SAND IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN BURIED THEY LOOKED ALMOST AS MUCH ALIKE AS SO MANY RAINDROPS
8468-286673-0001 THE MOTHER TURTLE WHO WAS SUNNING HERSELF ON THE BANK NEAR BY SAID TO HER FRIENDS WHY THERE ARE MY CHILDREN DID YOU EVER SEE A FINER FAMILY I BELIEVE I WILL GO OVER AND SPEAK TO THEM
8468-286673-0002 AND THEN SAT DOWN UNTIL IT SHOULD STOP ACHING WAIT FOR ME HE CALLED OUT TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS I'M COMING IN A MINUTE THE OTHER LITTLE TURTLES WAITED BUT WHEN HIS TOE WAS COMFORTABLE AGAIN AND HE STARTED TOWARD THEM HE MET A VERY INTERESTING SNAIL
8468-286673-0003 AND TALKED A WHILE WITH HIM COME ON SAID THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE DON'T LET'S WAIT ANY LONGER HE CAN CATCH UP SO THEY SPRAWLED ALONG UNTIL THEY CAME TO A PLACE WHERE THEY COULD SIT IN A ROW ON AN OLD LOG AND THEY CLIMBED ONTO IT AND SAT JUST CLOSE ENOUGH TOGETHER
8468-286673-0004 AND NOT AT ALL TOO CLOSE THEN THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE CAME HURRYING OVER THE SAND WITH A RATHER CROSS LOOK IN HIS EYES AND PUTTING HIS FEET DOWN A LITTLE HARDER THAN HE NEEDED TO QUITE AS THOUGH HE WERE OUT OF PATIENCE ABOUT SOMETHING WHY DIDN'T YOU TURTLES WAIT FOR ME
8468-286673-0005 YOU CERTAINLY ARE FOR I SAW YOU SCRAMBLING OUT OF THE SAND A LITTLE WHILE AGO AND YOU CAME FROM THE VERY PLACE WHERE I LAID MY EGGS AND COVERED THEM DURING THE FIRST REALLY WARM NIGHTS THIS YEAR I WAS TELLING YOUR FATHER ONLY YESTERDAY THAT IT WAS ABOUT TIME FOR YOU TO HATCH
8468-286673-0006 THE SUN HAS BEEN SO HOT LATELY THAT I WAS SURE YOU WOULD DO WELL THE MOTHER TURTLE STRETCHED HER HEAD THIS WAY AND THAT UNTIL THERE WAS HARDLY A WRINKLE LEFT IN HER NECK SKIN SHE WAS SO EAGER TO SEE THEM ALL
8468-286673-0007 WHY ARE YOU NOT UP HERE WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE ASKED SUDDENLY OF THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WHO WAS TRYING TO MAKE A PLACE FOR HIMSELF ON THE LOG THEY DIDN'T WAIT FOR ME HE SAID I WAS COMING RIGHT ALONG BUT THEY WOULDN'T WAIT I THINK THEY ARE JUST AS MEA
8468-286673-0008 THE MOTHER TURTLE RAISED ONE OF HER FOREFEET UNTIL ALL FIVE OF ITS TOES WITH THEIR STRONG CLAWS WERE POINTING AT HIM SHE ALSO RAISED HER HEAD AS FAR AS HER UPPER SHELL WOULD LET HER SO YOU ARE THE ONE SHE SAID
8468-286673-0009 I THOUGHT YOU WERE WHEN I HEARD YOU TRYING TO MAKE THE OTHERS WAIT IT IS TOO BAD
8468-286673-0010 YET DOWN IN HIS LITTLE TURTLE HEART HE THOUGHT NOW THEY ARE GOING TO CATCH IT HE WAS SURE HIS MOTHER WAS GOING TO SCOLD THE OTHER TURTLE CHILDREN FOR LEAVING HIM HE WANTED TO SEE WHAT THEY WOULD DO SO HE LOOKED OUT OF HIS RIGHT EYE AT THE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON THAT SIDE
8468-286673-0011 THE FIRST YEAR I HAD ONLY A FEW CHILDREN THE NEXT YEAR I HAD MORE AND SO IT HAS GONE EVERY YEAR A FEW MORE CHILDREN THAN THE YEAR BEFORE UNTIL NOW I NEVER KNOW QUITE HOW MANY I DO HAVE BUT THERE IS ALWAYS ONE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-286673-0012 WHO LAGS BEHIND AND WANTS THE OTHERS TO WAIT FOR HIM THAT MAKES HIM MISS HIS SHARE OF GOOD THINGS AND THEN HE IS QUITE CERTAIN TO BE CROSS AND THINK IT IS SOMEBODY ELSE'S FAULT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE FELT THE TEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON HIS RIGHT SIDE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF THEIR LEFT EYES
8468-286673-0013 AND THE NINE BROTHERS AND SISTERS ON HIS LEFT SIDE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF THEIR RIGHT EYES HE DREW IN HIS HEAD AND HIS TAIL AND HIS LEGS UNTIL ALL THEY COULD SEE WAS HIS ROUNDED UPPER SHELL HIS SHELL SIDE WALLS AND THE YELLOW EDGE OF HIS FLAT LOWER SHELL
8468-286673-0014 I DID HOPE SAID THE MOTHER TURTLE THAT I MIGHT HAVE ONE FAMILY WITHOUT SUCH A CHILD IN IT I CANNOT HELP LOVING EVEN A SLOW CHILD WHO IS CROSS IF HE IS HATCHED FROM ONE OF MY EGGS YET IT MAKES ME SAD VERY VERY SAD
8468-286673-0015 AND YOU SHE ADDED TURNING TO HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS MUST BE PATIENT WITH HIM WE SHALL NOT HAVE HIM WITH US LONG
8468-286673-0016 I REMEMBER SO WELL MY FIRST SLOW CHILD AND HOW HE SHE BEGAN TO CRY AND SINCE SHE COULD NOT EASILY GET HER FOREFEET TO HER EYES SHE SPRAWLED TO THE POND AND SWAM OFF WITH ONLY HER HEAD AND A LITTLE OF HER UPPER SHELL SHOWING ABOVE THE WATER
8468-286673-0017 THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE WAS REALLY FRIGHTENED BY WHAT HIS MOTHER HAD SAID AND FOR A FEW DAYS HE TRIED TO KEEP UP WITH THE OTHERS NOTHING HAPPENED TO HIM AND SO HE GREW CARELESS AND MADE PEOPLE WAIT FOR HIM JUST BECAUSE HE WAS NOT QUITE READY TO GO WITH THEM
8468-286673-0018 OR BECAUSE HE WANTED TO DO THIS OR LOOK AT THAT OR TALK TO SOME OTHER PERSON HE WAS A VERY TRYING LITTLE TURTLE YET HIS MOTHER LOVED HIM AND DID NOT LIKE IT WHEN THE REST CALLED HIM A LAND TORTOISE IT IS ALL RIGHT YOU KNOW TO BE A LAND TORTOISE WHEN YOUR FATHER AND MOTHER ARE LAND TORTOISES
8468-286673-0019 AND THESE COUSINS OF THE TURTLES LOOK SO MUCH LIKE THEM THAT SOME PEOPLE CANNOT TELL THEM APART THAT IS BECAUSE THEY FORGET THAT THE TORTOISES LIVE ON LAND HAVE HIGHER BACK SHELLS AND MOVE VERY VERY SLOWLY TURTLES LIVE MORE IN THE WATER
8468-286673-0020 AND CAN MOVE QUICKLY IF THEY WILL THIS IS WHY OTHER TURTLES SOMETIMES MAKE FUN OF A SLOW BROTHER BY CALLING HIM A LAND TORTOISE ONE BEAUTIFUL SUNSHINY AFTERNOON WHEN MOST OF THE TWENTY LITTLE TURTLES WERE SITTING ON A FLOATING LOG BY THE EDGE OF THE POND
8468-286673-0021 THEIR MOTHER WAS WITH SOME OF HER FRIENDS ON ANOTHER LOG NEAR BY SHE LOOKED OFTEN AT HER CHILDREN AND THOUGHT HOW HANDSOME THEIR ROUNDED UP BACK SHELLS WERE IN THE SUNSHINE WITH THE LITTLE RED AND YELLOW MARKINGS SHOWING ON THE BLACK
8468-286673-0022 SHE COULD SEE THEIR STRONG LITTLE POINTED TAILS TOO AND THEIR WEBBED FEET WITH A STOUT CLAW ON EACH TOE SHE WAS SO PROUD THAT SHE COULD NOT HELP TALKING ABOUT THEM
8468-286673-0023 YES SAID A FINE OLD FELLOW WHO WAS FLOATING NEAR HER A ROW OF THEIR MOTHERS HE WAS A TURTLE WHOM SHE HAD NEVER LIKED VERY WELL BUT NOW SHE BEGAN TO THINK THAT HE WAS RATHER AGREEABLE AFTER ALL
8468-286673-0024 SHE WAS JUST NOTICING HOW BEAUTIFULLY THE SKIN WRINKLED ON HIS NECK WHEN SHE HEARD A SPLASH AND SAW TWO TERRIBLE GREAT TWO LEGGED ANIMALS WADING INTO THE POND FROM THE SHORE BOYS SHE CRIED BOYS AND SHE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HER LOG
8468-286673-0025 AND SLID INTO THE WATER ALL HER FRIENDS FOLLOWING HER THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE SAW THESE GREAT ANIMALS COMING TOWARD HIM HE SPRAWLED OFF THE END OF HIS LOG AND SLID INTO THE WATER AND ALL HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS FOLLOWED HIM EXCEPT THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-286673-0026 THEN ONE OF THESE GREAT ANIMALS STOOPED OVER AND PICKED HIM UP AND HELD HIM BOTTOM SIDE UPPERMOST AND RAPPED ON THAT SIDE WHICH WAS FLAT AND ON THE OTHER SIDE WHICH WAS ROUNDED AND STARED AT HIM WITH TWO GREAT EYES
8468-286673-0027 NEXT THE OTHER GREAT ANIMAL TOOK HIM AND TURNED HIM OVER AND RAPPED ON HIS SHELLS AND STARED AT HIM
8468-286673-0028 HE WAS THINKING OVER AND OVER SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED AND HE KNEW THAT BACK IN THE POND HIS MOTHER WOULD BE TRYING TO FIND HIM AND COULD NOT THE BOYS CARRIED HIM TO THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW AND PUT HIM DOWN ON THE GRASS
8468-286673-0029 HE LAY PERFECTLY STILL FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WHEN HE THOUGHT THEY HAD FORGOTTEN ABOUT HIM HE TRIED TO RUN AWAY THEN THEY LAUGHED AND PICKED HIM UP AGAIN AND ONE OF THEM TOOK SOMETHING SHARP AND SHINY AND CUT MARKS INTO HIS UPPER SHELL
8468-286673-0030 THIS DID NOT REALLY GIVE HIM PAIN YET AS HE SAID AFTERWARD IT HURTS ALMOST AS MUCH TO THINK YOU ARE GOING TO BE HURT AS IT DOES TO BE HURT IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE SUN WENT DOWN THAT THE BOYS LET THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE GO
8468-286673-0031 THEN HE WAS VERY VERY TIRED BUT HE WANTED SO MUCH TO GET BACK TO HIS HOME IN THE POND THAT HE STARTED AT ONCE BY MOONLIGHT THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER SEEN THE MOON FOR EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE LAYING EGGS TURTLES USUALLY SLEEP AT NIGHT
8468-286673-0032 I WISH I MIGHT HELP YOU SOME TIME
8468-286673-0033 I'M HERE HE CRIED JOYFULLY POKING FIRST ONE AND THEN ANOTHER OF THEM WITH HIS HEAD THE BIGGEST LITTLE TURTLE MOVED WITHOUT AWAKENING I TELL YOU I'M NOT HUNGRY HE MURMURED
8468-286673-0034 AND AGAIN HE FELL FAST ASLEEP
8468-286673-0035 BUT CUDDLED INSIDE HIS TWO SHELLS AND WENT TO SLEEP ALSO HE WAS SO TIRED THAT HE DID NOT AWAKEN UNTIL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE SKY WHEN HE DID OPEN HIS EYES HIS RELATIVES WERE SITTING AROUND LOOKING AT HIM AND HE REMEMBERED ALL THAT HAD HAPPENED BEFORE HE SLEPT
8468-286673-0036 DOES MY SHELL LOOK VERY BAD HE CRIED I WISH I COULD SEE IT OH I AM SO GLAD TO GET BACK I'LL NEVER BE SLOW AGAIN NEVER NEVER HIS MOTHER CAME AND LEANED HER SHELL LOVINGLY AGAINST HIS
8468-286673-0037 IF YOU WILL ONLY LEARN TO KEEP UP WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS SHE SAID I SHALL NOT BE SORRY THAT THE BOYS CARRIED YOU OFF YOU JUST WAIT AND SEE SAID THE SLOW LITTLE TURTLE AND HE WAS AS GOOD AS HIS WORD AFTER THAT
8468-286673-0038 HE WAS ALWAYS THE FIRST TO SLIP FROM THE LOG TO THE WATER IF ANYTHING SCARED THEM AND WHEN ONE DAY A STRANGE TURTLE FROM ANOTHER POND CAME TO VISIT HE SAID TO THE TURTLES WHO HAD ALWAYS LIVED THERE
8468-286673-0039 HE IS THE QUICKEST ONE IN HIS FAMILY THE POND PEOPLE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER AND LAUGHED THAT IS QUEER THEY SAID AFTER THIS WE WILL CALL HIM THE QUICK LITTLE TURTLE THIS MADE HIM VERY HAPPY AND WHEN ONCE IN A WHILE SOMEBODY FORGOT
8468-286673-0040 AND BY MISTAKE CALLED HIM THE QUICK SLOW LITTLE TURTLE
8468-294887-0000 AND WITH A FEW OTHERS DEVOTED THE MOST OF THE SABBATH TO THEIR TEACHING WHEN HE AND HIS BROTHER ARTHUR ASSEMBLED THE SEVENTY ANTI SLAVERY AGENTS WHO WERE THEREAFTER LIKE FIREBRANDS SCATTERED ALL OVER THE LAND THEY HELD THEIR MEETINGS IN THIS ROOM
8468-294887-0001 THESE AGENTS WERE ENTERTAINED BY ABOLITIONISTS IN THE CITY AND MANY OF US HAD TWO OR THREE OF THEM IN EACH OF OUR FAMILIES FOR A COUPLE OF WEEKS
8468-294887-0002 THEY WENT OUT ALL OVER THE LAND AND WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN DIFFUSING MORE TRUTH PERHAPS ABOUT THE DREADFUL SYSTEM OF AMERICAN SLAVERY THAN WAS ACCOMPLISHED IN ANY OTHER WAY HE ALSO AIDED IN ESTABLISHING SEVERAL PERIODICALS BRIMFUL OF ANTI SLAVERY TRUTH
8468-294887-0003 AMONG WHICH WERE THE ANTI SLAVERY RECORD THE EMANCIPATOR THE SLAVE'S FRIEND THE LATTER TO INDOCTRINATE THE CHILDREN IN ANTI SLAVERY THE AMERICAN MISSIONARY SOCIETY ORIGINALLY BEGUN FOR THE SUPPORT OF A MISSION IN AFRICA
8468-294887-0004 ON THE OCCASION OF THE RETURN OF THE AMISTAD CAPTORS TO THEIR NATIVE LAND AND NOW DOING SO MUCH FOR THE FREEDMEN OF THE SOUTH WAS ALMOST ENTIRELY ESTABLISHED BY HIS EFFORTS DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF SLAVERY MUCH WAS DONE BY THIS SOCIETY
8468-294887-0005 THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FOR AIDING AND BEFRIENDING FUGITIVES OF WHICH I WAS TREASURER FOR MANY YEARS HAD NO BETTER OR WARMER FRIEND THAN HE HE WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AT THEIR MEETINGS WHICH WERE KNOWN ONLY TO THE ELECT FOR WE DARED NOT HOLD THEM TOO PUBLICLY
8468-294887-0006 AS WE ALMOST ALWAYS HAD SOME OF THE TRAVELERS TOWARD THE NORTH STAR PRESENT WHOSE MASTERS OR THEIR AGENTS WERE FREQUENTLY IN THE CITY IN HOT PURSUIT AT FIRST WE SENT THEM TO CANADA BUT AFTER A WHILE SENT THEM ONLY TO SYRACUSE AND THE CENTRE OF THE STATE
8468-294887-0007 IN EIGHTEEN THIRTY FOUR I THINK WAS THE FIRST RIOTING THE SACKING OF MISTER TAPPAN'S HOUSE IN ROSE STREET THE MOB BROUGHT ALL HIS FURNITURE OUT AND PILING IT UP IN THE STREET SET IT ON FIRE THE FAMILY WERE ABSENT AT THE TIME
8468-294887-0008 BUT HEARING THAT THERE WERE A FEW LOADED MUSKETS THERE THEY TOOK IT OUT IN THREATS BUT THEIR MERCANTILE ESTABLISHMENT WAS ALMOST OSTRACISED AT THIS TIME BY THE DRY GOODS MERCHANTS
8468-294887-0009 AND WHEN THEY DID SO REQUESTED PARTICULARLY THAT THE BUNDLES OR BOXES SHOULD NOT BE MARKED FROM A TAPPAN AND CO AS WAS CUSTOMARY SOUTHERN MERCHANTS ESPECIALLY AVOIDED THEM
8468-294887-0010 AND WHEN TWO OR THREE YEARS LATER THERE WAS A GENERAL INSOLVENCY AMONG THEM OCCASIONALLY LARGE LOSSES TO NEW YORK MERCHANTS AND IN SOME CASES FAILURE THE TAPPANS WERE SAVED BY HAVING NO SOUTHERN DEBTS
8468-294887-0011 MANY REMITTANCES CAME FOR THE HELP OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE FROM ENGLAND AND SCOTLAND AND AT ONE TIME AN EXTENSIVE INVOICE OF USEFUL AND FANCY ARTICLES IN SEVERAL LARGE BOXES WAS RECEIVED FROM THE GLASGOW LADIES SUFFICIENT TO FURNISH A LARGE BAZAAR OR FAIR
8468-294887-0012 WHICH WAS HELD IN BROOKLYN FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE COMMITTEE ALTHOUGH LATELY AFFLICTED BY DISEASE MISTER TAPPAN STILL LIVES IN THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HIS FACULTIES AND A GOOD MEASURE OF HEALTH

8468-295198-0002 THEN HAVING PERFECTLY BEWILDERED THE POOR OLD GENTLEMAN WHO WAS ALWAYS SLEEPY OF A MONDAY MORNING MOTHER MAGPIE WOULD TAKE A PEEP INTO MISSUS ORIOLE'S NEST SIT CHATTERING ON A BOUGH ABOVE AND POUR FORTH FLOODS OF ADVICE
8468-295198-0003 DEPEND UPON IT MY DEAR MOTHER MAGPIE WOULD SAY THAT THIS WAY OF BUILDING YOUR NEST SWINGING LIKE AN OLD EMPTY STOCKING FROM A BOUGH ISN'T AT ALL THE THING I NEVER BUILT ONE SO IN MY LIFE AND I NEVER HAVE HEADACHES
8468-295198-0004 NOW YOU COMPLAIN ALWAYS THAT YOUR HEAD ACHES WHENEVER I CALL UPON YOU IT'S ALL ON ACCOUNT OF THIS WAY OF SWINGING AND SWAYING ABOUT IN SUCH AN ABSURD MANNER BUT MY DEAR
8468-295198-0005 PIPED MISSUS ORIOLE TIMIDLY THE ORIOLES ALWAYS HAVE BUILT IN THIS MANNER AND IT SUITS OUR CONSTITUTION A FIDDLE ON YOUR CONSTITUTION HOW CAN YOU TELL WHAT AGREES WITH YOUR CONSTITUTION UNLESS YOU TRY YOU OWN YOU ARE NOT WELL
8468-295198-0006 YOU ARE SUBJECT TO HEADACHES AND EVERY PHYSICIAN WILL TELL YOU THAT A TILTING MOTION DISORDERS THE STOMACH AND ACTS UPON THE BRAIN ASK OLD DOCTOR KITE I WAS TALKING WITH HIM ABOUT YOUR CASE ONLY YESTERDAY AND SAYS HE MISSUS MAGPIE I PERFECTLY AGREE WITH YOU
8468-295198-0007 BUT MY HUSBAND PREFERS THIS STYLE OF BUILDING THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE HE ISN'T PROPERLY INSTRUCTED PRAY DID YOU EVER ATTEND DOCTOR KITE'S LECTURES ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM NO I HAVE NO TIME TO ATTEND LECTURES WHO WOULD SIT ON THE EGGS
8468-295198-0008 O MISSUS MAGPIE PRAY DON'T SPEAK TO MY HUSBAND HE WILL THINK I'VE BEEN COMPLAINING NO NO HE WON'T LET ME ALONE I UNDERSTAND JUST HOW TO SAY THE THING I'VE ADVISED HUNDREDS OF YOUNG HUSBANDS IN MY DAY AND I NEVER GAVE OFFENCE
8468-295198-0009 I SAY MY DEAR IF YOU WILL PERSIST IN GOSSIPING OVER OUR PRIVATE FAMILY MATTERS WITH THAT OLD MOTHER MAGPIE MY DEAR I DON'T GOSSIP SHE COMES AND BORES ME TO DEATH WITH TALKING AND THEN GOES OFF AND MISTAKES WHAT SHE HAS BEEN SAYING FOR WHAT I SAID
8468-295198-0010 BUT YOU MUST CUT HER I TRY TO ALL I CAN BUT SHE WON'T BE CUT IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE A BIRD SWEAR SAID TOMMY ORIOLE TOMMY ORIOLE TO SAY THE TRUTH HAD AS GOOD A HEART AS EVER BEAT UNDER BIRD'S FEATHERS
8468-295198-0011 BUT THEN HE HAD A WEAKNESS FOR CONCERTS AND GENERAL SOCIETY BECAUSE HE WAS HELD TO BE BY ALL ODDS THE HANDSOMEST BIRD IN THE WOODS AND SUNG LIKE AN ANGEL AND SO THE TRUTH WAS HE DIDN'T CONFINE HIMSELF SO MUCH TO THE DOMESTIC NEST AS TOM TITMOUSE OR BILLY WREN
8468-295198-0012 THE FACT IS QUOTH TOMMY I AM A SOCIETY BIRD AND NATURE HAS MARKED OUT FOR ME A COURSE BEYOND THE RANGE OF THE COMMONPLACE AND MY WIFE MUST LEARN TO ACCOMMODATE IF SHE HAS A BRILLIANT HUSBAND
8468-295198-0013 WHOSE SUCCESS GRATIFIES HER AMBITION AND PLACES HER IN A DISTINGUISHED PUBLIC POSITION SHE MUST PAY SOMETHING FOR IT I'M SURE BILLY WREN'S WIFE WOULD GIVE HER VERY BILL TO SEE HER HUSBAND IN THE CIRCLES WHERE I AM QUITE AT HOME TO SAY THE TRUTH
8468-295198-0014 MY WIFE WAS ALL WELL ENOUGH CONTENT TILL OLD MOTHER MAGPIE INTERFERED IT IS QUITE MY DUTY TO TAKE STRONG GROUND AND SHOW THAT I CANNOT BE DICTATED TO
8468-295198-0015 AND SOMETIMES WILL TAKE THE MOST UNREASONABLE COURSES IF A MEDDLESOME MAGPIE GETS HER CLAW INTO THEIR NEST BUT OLD MOTHER MAGPIE HAD NOW GOT A NEW BUSINESS IN HAND IN ANOTHER QUARTER SHE BUSTLED OFF DOWN TO WATER DOCK LANE WHERE AS WE SAID IN A FORMER NARRATIVE
8468-295198-0016 LIVED THE OLD MUSIC TEACHER DOCTOR BULLFROG THE POOR OLD DOCTOR WAS A SIMPLE MINDED GOOD AMIABLE CREATURE WHO HAD PLAYED THE DOUBLE BASS AND LED THE FOREST CHOIR ON ALL PUBLIC OCCASIONS SINCE NOBODY KNOWS WHEN
8468-295198-0017 LATTERLY SOME YOUNGSTERS HAD ARISEN WHO SNEERED AT HIS PERFORMANCES AS BEHIND THE AGE IN FACT SINCE A GREAT CITY HAD GROWN UP IN THE VICINITY OF THE FOREST TRIBES OF WANDERING BOYS BROKE UP THE SIMPLE TASTES AND QUIET HABITS
8468-295198-0018 WHICH OLD MOTHER NATURE HAD ALWAYS KEPT UP IN THOSE PARTS THEY PULLED THE YOUNG CHECKERBERRY BEFORE IT EVEN HAD TIME TO BLOSSOM ROOTED UP THE SASSAFRAS SHRUBS AND GNAWED THEIR ROOTS FIRED OFF GUNS AT THE BIRDS AND ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS
8468-295198-0019 WHEN OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG WAS LEADING A CONCERT HAD DASHED IN AND BROKEN UP THE CHOIR BY THROWING STONES THIS WAS NOT THE WORST OF IT THE LITTLE VARLETS HAD A WAY OF JEERING AT THE SIMPLE OLD DOCTOR AND HIS CONCERTS
8468-295198-0020 THAT OLD BULLFROG WAS A BORE AND THAT IT WAS TIME TO GET UP A NEW STYLE OF MUSIC IN THE PARISH AND TO GIVE THE CHARGE OF IT TO SOME MORE MODERN PERFORMER
8468-295198-0021 POOR OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG KNEW NOTHING OF THIS HOWEVER AND WAS DOING HIS SIMPLE BEST IN PEACE WHEN MOTHER MAGPIE CALLED IN UPON HIM ONE MORNING WELL NEIGHBOUR HOW UNREASONABLE PEOPLE ARE WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT
8468-295198-0022 MADAM SAID DOCTOR BULLFROG WITH ALL THAT ENERGY OF TONE FOR WHICH HE WAS REMARKABLE I DON'T BELIEVE IT I CAN'T BELIEVE IT YOU MUST HAVE MADE A MISTAKE
8468-295198-0023 NO NO MY GOOD FRIEND I NEVER MAKE MISTAKES WHAT I KNOW I KNOW CERTAINLY
8468-295198-0024 AND NANCY NIBBLE WHO ARE MARRIED THIS VERY DAY I KNEW THAT THING SIX WEEKS BEFORE ANY BIRD OR BEAST IN OUR PARTS AND I CAN TELL YOU YOU ARE GOING TO BE SCANDALOUSLY AND UNGRATEFULLY TREATED DOCTOR BULLFROG
8468-295198-0025 BLESS ME WE SHALL ALL BE RUINED SAID MISSUS BULLFROG MY POOR HUSBAND OH AS TO THAT IF YOU TAKE THINGS IN TIME AND LISTEN TO MY ADVICE SAID MOTHER MAGPIE WE MAY YET PULL YOU THROUGH YOU MUST ALTER YOUR STYLE A LITTLE
8468-295198-0026 ADAPT IT TO MODERN TIMES EVERYBODY NOW IS A LITTLE TOUCHED WITH THE OPERATIC FEVER AND THERE'S TOMMY ORIOLE HAS BEEN TO NEW ORLEANS AND BROUGHT BACK A TOUCH OF THE ARTISTIC IF YOU WOULD TRY HIS STYLE A LITTLE SOMETHING TYROLEAN YOU SEE
8468-295198-0027 DEAR MADAM CONSIDER MY VOICE I NEVER COULD HIT THE HIGH NOTES HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S ALL PRACTICE TOMMY ORIOLE SAYS SO JUST TRY THE SCALES AS TO YOUR VOICE YOUR MANNER OF LIVING HAS A GREAT DEAL TO DO WITH IT
8468-295198-0028 I ALWAYS DID TELL YOU THAT YOUR PASSION FOR WATER INJURED YOUR SINGING SUPPOSE TOMMY ORIOLE SHOULD SIT HALF HIS DAYS UP TO HIS HIPS IN WATER AS YOU DO HIS VOICE WOULD BE AS HOARSE AND ROUGH AS YOURS COME UP ON THE BANK AND LEARN TO PERCH AS WE BIRDS DO
8468-295198-0029 WE ARE THE TRUE MUSICAL RACE AND SO POOR MISTER BULLFROG WAS PERSUADED TO FOREGO HIS PLEASANT LITTLE COTTAGE UNDER THE CAT TAILS WHERE HIS GREEN SPECTACLES AND HONEST ROUND BACK HAD EXCITED EVEN IN THE MINDS OF THE BOYS SENTIMENTS OF RESPECT AND COMPASSION
8468-295198-0030 HE CAME UP INTO THE GARDEN AND ESTABLISHED HIMSELF UNDER A BURDOCK AND BEGAN TO PRACTISE ITALIAN SCALES THE RESULT WAS THAT POOR OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG INSTEAD OF BEING CONSIDERED AS A RESPECTABLE OLD BORE
8468-295198-0031 GOT HIMSELF UNIVERSALLY LAUGHED AT FOR APING FASHIONABLE MANNERS EVERY BIRD AND BEAST IN THE FOREST HAD A GIBE AT HIM AND EVEN OLD PARSON TOO WHIT THOUGHT IT WORTH HIS WHILE TO MAKE HIM A PASTORAL CALL
8468-295198-0032 AND ADMONISH HIM ABOUT COURSES UNBEFITTING HIS AGE AND STANDING AS TO MOTHER MAGPIE YOU MAY BE SURE THAT SHE ASSURED EVERY ONE HOW SORRY SHE WAS THAT DEAR OLD DOCTOR BULLFROG HAD MADE SUCH A FOOL OF HIMSELF
8468-295198-0033 BUT THE TRAGEDY FOR THE POOR OLD MUSIC TEACHER GREW EVEN MORE MELANCHOLY IN ITS TERMINATION FOR ONE DAY AS HE WAS SITTING DISCONSOLATELY UNDER A CURRANT BUSH IN THE GARDEN PRACTISING HIS POOR OLD NOTES IN A QUIET WAY THUMP
8580-287363-0000 RAPIDLY THE AIRSHIP ASCENDED AND WHEN IT WAS HIGH OVER THE TOWN OF SHOPTON TOM HEADED THE CRAFT DUE WEST LOOKING DOWN HE TRIED TO DESCRY MARY NESTOR IN HER CARRIAGE BUT THE TREES WERE IN THE WAY
8580-287363-0001 THEIR INTERLOCKING BRANCHES HIDING THE GIRL TOM DID SEE CROWDS OF OTHER PERSONS THOUGH THRONGING THE STREETS OF SHOPTON FOR THOUGH THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD MADE MANY FLIGHTS THERE WAS ALWAYS A NOVELTY ABOUT THEM THAT BROUGHT OUT THE CURIOUS
8580-287363-0002 COMPLIMENTED MISTER PARKER IS IT ALWAYS AS EASY AS THIS STARTING ALWAYS IS WAS THE ANSWER THOUGH AS THE IRISHMAN SAID COMING DOWN ISN'T SOMETIMES QUITE SO COMFORTABLE BLESS MY GIZZARD THAT'S SO
8580-287363-0003 CRIED THE ECCENTRIC MISTER DAMON CAN WE VOL PLANE TO EARTH IN THE RED CLOUD TOM YES BUT NOT AS EASILY AS IN THE BUTTERFLY HOWEVER I HOPE WE WILL NOT HAVE TO
8580-287363-0004 NOW MISTER DAMON IF YOU WILL JUST TAKE CHARGE OF THE STEERING APPARATUS FOR A MINUTE I WANT TO GO AFT WHAT FOR I WISH TO SEE IF EVERYTHING IS ALL RIGHT I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY ERADICATE WAS MAKING THOSE QUEER MOTIONS
8580-287363-0005 MISTER DAMON WHO KNEW HOW TO OPERATE THE RED CLOUD WAS SOON GUIDING HER ON THE COURSE WHILE TOM MADE HIS WAY TO THE REAR COMPARTMENTS THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM WHERE THE STORES OF SUPPLIES AND FOOD WERE KEPT HE MADE A CAREFUL EXAMINATION
8580-287363-0006 LOOKING FROM AN AFTER WINDOW AND EVEN GOING OUT ON A SMALL OPEN PLATFORM BUT COULD DISCOVER NOTHING WRONG I GUESS RAD WAS JUST CAPERING ABOUT WITHOUT ANY SPECIAL OBJECT MUSED TOM
8580-287363-0007 THAT THE COLORED MAN HAD HAD A METHOD IN HIS MADNESS ON HIS WAY BACK THROUGH THE MOTOR ROOM TOM LOOKED TO THE MACHINERY AND ADJUSTED SOME OF THE AUXILIARY OIL FEEDERS THE VARIOUS PIECES OF APPARATUS WERE WORKING WELL
8580-287363-0008 THOUGH THE ENGINE HAD NOT YET BEEN SPEEDED UP TO ITS LIMIT TOM WANTED IT TO WARM UP FIRST EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT ASKED MISTER DAMON AS TOM REJOINED THEM IN THE PILOT HOUSE WHICH WAS JUST FORWARD OF THE LIVING ROOM IN THE MAIN CABIN
8580-287363-0009 YES I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT MADE RAD ACT THAT WAY BUT I'LL SET THE AUTOMATIC STEERING GEAR NOW MISTER DAMON AND THEN YOU WILL BE RELIEVED MISTER JENKS WAS GAZING OFF TOWARD THE WEST
8580-287363-0010 TO WHERE HE HOPED TO DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN HOW DO YOU LIKE IT ASKED TOM IT'S GREAT REPLIED THE DIAMOND MAN I'VE NEVER BEEN IN AN AIRSHIP BEFORE AND IT'S DIFFERENT THAN WHAT I EXPECTED BUT IT'S GREAT
8580-287363-0011 IT'S THE ONLY CRAFT THAT WILL SERVE OUR PURPOSE AMONG THE TOWERING MOUNTAIN PEAKS WHERE THE DIAMOND MAKERS ARE HIDDEN I HOPE WE CAN FIND THEM IN A LITTLE WHILE THE RED CLOUD WAS SKIMMING ALONG AT FASTER SPEED
8580-287363-0012 GUIDED BY THE AUTOMATIC RUDDERS SO THAT NO ONE WAS NEEDED IN THE PILOT HOUSE SINCE THERE WAS NO DANGER OF COLLISIONS AIRSHIPS ARE NOT QUITE NUMEROUS ENOUGH FOR THAT YET THOUGH THEY MAY SOON BECOME SO
8580-287363-0013 TOM AND THE OTHERS DEVOTED SEVERAL HOURS TO ARRANGING THEIR STATEROOMS AND BUNKS AND GETTING THEIR CLOTHING STOWED AWAY AND WHEN THIS WAS DONE MISTER PARKER AND MISTER JENKS SAT GAZING OFF INTO SPACE IT'S HARD TO REALIZE THAT WE ARE REALLY IN AN AIRSHIP
8580-287363-0014 OBSERVED THE DIAMOND MAN AT FIRST I THOUGHT I WOULD BE FRIGHTENED BUT I'M NOT A BIT IT DOESN'T SEEM AS IF ANYTHING COULD HAPPEN SOMETHING IS LIKELY TO HAPPEN SOON SAID MISTER PARKER SUDDENLY
8580-287363-0015 AS HE GAZED AT SOME WEATHER INSTRUMENTS ON THE CABIN WALL BLESS MY SOUL DON'T SAY THAT CRIED MISTER DAMON WHAT IS IT I THINK FROM MY OBSERVATIONS THAT WE WILL SOON HAVE A HURRICANE SAID THE SCIENTIFIC MAN
8580-287363-0016 THERE IS EVERY INDICATION OF IT AND HE SEEMED QUITE DELIGHTED AT THE PROSPECT OF HIS PREDICTION COMING TRUE A HURRICANE CRIED MISTER DAMON I HOPE IT ISN'T LIKE THE ONE THAT BLEW US TO EARTHQUAKE ISLAND
8580-287363-0017 OH I THINK THERE WILL BE NO DANGER SPOKE TOM IF IT COMES ON TO BLOW WE WILL ASCEND OR DESCEND OUT OF THE PATH OF THE STORM THIS CRAFT IS NOT LIKE THE ILL FATED WHIZZER I CAN MORE EASILY HANDLE THE RED CLOUD EVEN IN A BAD STORM
8580-287363-0018 REMARKED MISTER JENKS IT WOULD BE TOO BAD TO BE WRECKED BEFORE WE GOT TO PHANTOM MOUNTAIN WELL I PREDICT THAT WE WILL HAVE A BAD STORM INSISTED MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0019 AND TOM COULD NOT HELP WISHING THAT THE SCIENTIST WOULD KEEP HIS GLOOMY FOREBODINGS TO HIMSELF HOWEVER THE STORM HAD NOT DEVELOPED UP TO NOON WHEN TOM WITH MISTER DAMON'S HELP SERVED A FINE MEAL IN THE DINING ROOM IN THE AFTERNOON THE SPEED OF THE SHIP WAS INCREASED
8580-287363-0020 AND BY NIGHT THEY HAD COVERED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES THROUGH THE DARKNESS THE RED CLOUD KEPT ON MAKING GOOD TIME TOM GOT UP OCCASIONALLY TO LOOK TO THE MACHINERY
8580-287363-0021 AND AN ALARM BELL WOULD SOUND IN HIS STATEROOM WHEN ANYTHING WENT WRONG BLESS MY NAPKIN EXCLAIMED MISTER DAMON THE NEXT MORNING AS THEY SAT DOWN TO A BREAKFAST OF FRUIT HAM AND EGGS AND FRAGRANT COFFEE
8580-287363-0022 AND YET WE ARE HOW FAR ARE WE ABOVE THE EARTH TOM HE ASKED TURNING TO THE YOUNG INVENTOR ABOUT TWO MILES NOW I JUST SENT HER UP AS I THOUGHT I DETECTED THAT STORM MISTER PARKER SPOKE OF I TOLD YOU IT WOULD COME DECLARED THE SCIENTIST
8580-287363-0023 THAT MORNING BUT ONLY THE LOWER EDGE OF IT CAUGHT THE RED CLOUD AND WHEN TOM SENT HER UP STILL HIGHER SHE FOUND A COMPARATIVELY QUIET ZONE WHERE SHE SLID ALONG AT GOOD SPEED
8580-287363-0024 THAT AFTERNOON TOM BUSIED HIMSELF ABOUT SOME WIRES AND A NUMBER OF COMPLICATED PIECES OF APPARATUS WHICH WERE IN ONE CORNER OF THE MAIN CABIN WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW ASKED MISTER JENKS WHO HAD BEEN TALKING WITH MISTER PARKER
8580-287363-0025 AND SHOWING THAT SCIENTIST SOME OF THE MANUFACTURED DIAMONDS GETTING OUR WIRELESS APPARATUS IN SHAPE ANSWERED THE LAD I SHOULD HAVE DONE IT BEFORE BUT I HAD SO MUCH TO DO THAT I COULDN'T GET AT IT
8580-287363-0026 DAD WILL WANT TO KNOW HOW WE ARE DOING AS HE WORKED AWAY HE ALSO MADE UP HIS MIND TO SEND ANOTHER MESSAGE IN CARE OF HIS FATHER FOR THERE WAS A RECEIVING STATION IN THE SWIFT HOME AND TO WHOM THIS MESSAGE WAS ADDRESSED TOM DID NOT SAY
8580-287363-0027 BUT WE FANCY SOME OF OUR READERS CAN GUESS FINALLY AFTER SEVERAL HOURS OF WORK THE WIRELESS WAS IN SHAPE TO SEND AND RECEIVE MESSAGES TOM PULLED OVER THE LEVER AND A CRACKLING SOUND WAS HEARD
8580-287363-0028 AS THE ELECTRICITY LEAPED FROM THE TRANSMITTERS INTO SPACE THEN HE CLAMPED THE RECEIVER ON HIS EAR ALL READY HE ANNOUNCED HAS ANYBODY ANY MESSAGES THEY WISH SENT FOR WITH THE COURTESY OF A TRUE HOST
8580-287363-0029 HE WAS READY TO SERVE HIS GUESTS BEFORE HE FORWARDED HIS OWN WIRELESS NOTES JUST TELL MY WIFE THAT I'M ENJOYING MYSELF REQUESTED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY FOOTSTOOL BUT THIS IS GREAT WE'RE OFF THE EARTH YET
8580-287363-0030 CONNECTED WITH IT MISTER JENKS HAD NO ONE TO WHOM HE WANTED TO SEND ANY WORD BUT MISTER PARKER WISH TO WIRE TO A FELLOW SCIENTIST THE RESULT OF SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE IN THE UPPER AIR TOM NOTED ALL THE MESSAGES DOWN
8580-287363-0031 AND THEN WHEN ALL WAS IN READINESS HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS HOME STATION HE KNEW THAT EITHER HIS FATHER OR MISTER JACKSON THE ENGINEER COULD RECEIVE THE WIRELESS
8580-287363-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD THE YOUNG INVENTOR SENT OFF THE FIRST FEW DOTS AND DASHES REPRESENTING S I HIS HOME STATION CALL THAN HE STARTED AND A LOOK OF SURPRISE CAME OVER HIS FACE THEY'RE CALLING US HE EXCLAIMED WHO IS
8580-287363-0033 ASKED MISTER JENKS MY HOUSE MY FATHER HE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET US EVER SINCE WE STARTED BUT I DIDN'T HAVE THE WIRELESS IN SHAPE TO RECEIVE MESSAGES OH I HOPE IT'S NOT TOO LATE TOO LATE BLESS MY SOUL TOO LATE FOR WHAT
8580-287363-0034 GASPED MISTER DAMON SOMEWHAT ALARMED BY TOM'S MANNER THE LAD DID NOT ANSWER AT ONCE HE WAS INTENTLY LISTENING TO A SERIES OF DOTS AND DASHES THAT CLICKED IN THE TELEPHONE RECEIVER CLAMPED TO HIS LEFT EAR ON HIS FACE
8580-287363-0035 THERE WAS A LOOK OF WORRIMENT FATHER HAS JUST SENT ME A MESSAGE HE SAID IT'S A WARNING FLASHED THROUGH SPACE HE'S BEEN TRYING TO GET IT TO ME SINCE YESTERDAY
8580-287363-0036 ASKED MISTER JENKS RISING FROM HIS SEAT THE MYSTERIOUS MAN IS ABOARD THE AIRSHIP HIDDEN AWAY CRIED TOM THAT'S WHAT ERADICATE WAS TRYING TO CALL TO OUR ATTENTION AS WE STARTED OFF
8580-287364-0000 CHAPTER TEN DROPPING THE STOWAWAY TOM'S EXCITED ANNOUNCEMENT STARTLED MISTER DAMON AND THE OTHERS AS MUCH AS IF THE YOUNG INVENTOR HAD INFORMED THEM THAT THE AIRSHIP HAD EXPLODED
8580-287364-0001 AND WAS ABOUT TO DASH WITH THEM TO THE EARTH THE MEN LEAPED TO THEIR FEET AND STARED AT THE LAD A STOWAWAY ON BOARD CRIED MISTER DAMON BLESS MY SOUL HOW DID HE ARE YOU SURE THAT MESSAGE IS STRAIGHT ASKED MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0002 DID ERADICATE SEE THE MAN HE SAYS HE DID ANSWERED TOM THE MAN IS HIDDEN AWAY ON BOARD NOW PROBABLY AMONG THE STORES AND SUPPLIES BLESS MY TOMATO SAUCE EXPLODED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0003 WE MUST GET HIM OUT AT ONCE DECLARED MISTER JENKS I KNEW SOMETHING WOULD HAPPEN ON THIS VOYAGE CAME FROM MISTER PARKER I PREDICTED IT FROM THE FIRST TOM THOUGHT CONSIDERABLE
8580-287364-0004 BUT HE DID NOT ANSWER THE SCIENTIST JUST THEN ANOTHER COMMUNICATION WAS COMING TO HIM BY WIRELESS HE LISTENED INTENTLY FATHER SAYS THE LAD TOLD HIS COMPANIONS THAT ERADICATE ONLY HAD A GLIMPSE OF THE MAN AT THE LAST MOMENT
8580-287364-0005 HE WAS LOOKING FROM THE REAR STOREROOM WINDOW HE'S THE SAME MAN WHO CALLED ON ME THAT TIME RAD REMEMBERS HIM VERY WELL BLESS MY SHOES WHAT'S TO BE DONE INQUIRED MISTER DAMON LOOKING AROUND HELPLESSLY
8580-287364-0006 DECIDED MISTER JENKS WITH VIGOR GET HIM OUT AND DROP HIM OVERBOARD DROP HIM OVERBOARD CRIED MISTER PARKER IN HORROR NOT EXACTLY BUT GET RID OF HIM
8580-287364-0007 THAT MAN IS ONE OF MY ENEMIES HE HAS BEEN SENT BY THE BAND OF DIAMOND MAKERS HIDDEN AMONG THE MOUNTAINS TO SPY ON ME AND IF POSSIBLE PREVENT ME FROM SEEKING TO DISCOVER THEIR SECRET
8580-287364-0008 HE TRIED TO WORK ON TOM'S SWIFT'S FEARS AND FRIGHTEN HIM FROM USING HIS AIRSHIP ON THIS QUEST THEN WHEN HE FAILED THE MAN MUST HAVE SNEAKED INTO THE SHED AND HIDDEN HIMSELF IN THE SHIP WE MUST GET RID OF HIM OR HE MAY WRECK THE RED CLOUD
8580-287364-0009 THAT'S SO CRIED TOM WE MUST TRY TO CAPTURE HIM I THINK WE HAD BETTER THE LAD PAUSED AND AGAIN LISTENED TO THE WIRELESS MESSAGE FATHER SAYS ERADICATE SAW THE MAN HAVE A GUN SO WE MUST BE CAREFUL
8580-287364-0010 THE YOUNG INVENTOR TRANSLATED THE DOTS AND DASHES BLESS MY POWDER HORN EXPLODED MISTER DAMON WE SHALL HAVE TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY THEN SPOKE MISTER JENKS
8580-287364-0011 IF HE IS LIKE ANY OTHERS IN THE GANG HE IS A DESPERATE MAN BETTER SNEAK UP ON HIM THEN IF WE CAN PROPOSED MISTER PARKER THERE ARE ENOUGH OF US TO COPE WITH ONE MAN EVEN IF HE IS ARMED
8580-287364-0012 HE INQUIRED OF TOM YES WAS THE HESITATING ANSWER BUT I DON'T WANT TO USE THEM IF I CAN HELP IT NOT ONLY BECAUSE OF THE DANGER AND A DISLIKE OF SHEDDING BLOOD BUT
8580-287364-0013 BECAUSE A STRAY BULLET MIGHT PIERCE THE GAS BAG AND DAMAGE THE SHIP THAT'S SO AGREED MISTER JENKS WELL I GUESS IF WE GO AT IT THE RIGHT WAY WE CAN CAPTURE HIM WITHOUT ANY SHOOTING BUT WE MUST TALK MORE QUIETLY
8580-287364-0014 HE MAY HAVE HEARD US I DON'T THINK SO REPLIED TOM THE STOREROOM IS FAR ENOUGH OFF SO THAT HE COULDN'T HEAR US BESIDES THE MOTOR MAKES SUCH A RACKET THAT HE COULDN'T DISTINGUISH WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EVEN IF HE HEARD OUR VOICES
8580-287364-0015 SO UNLESS HE HEARD THE WIRELESS WORKING AND SUSPECTS SOMETHING FROM THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW THAT WE ARE AWARE OF HIS PRESENCE ABOARD BUT WHY DO YOU THINK HE HAS REMAINED QUIET ALL THIS WHILE TOM ASKED MISTER DAMON
8580-287364-0016 PROBABLY HE WANTS TO WAIT UNTIL THE SHIP IS FARTHER OUT WEST SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS THEN HE WILL BE NEARER HIS FRIENDS AND CAN GET HELP IF HE NEEDS IT AND DO YOU REALLY BELIEVE HE WOULD DESTROY THE RED CLOUD ASKED MISTER PARKER
8580-287364-0017 I THINK THAT ALL HE IS WAITING FOR IS A FAVORABLE CHANCE DECLARED THE DIAMOND SEEKER HE WOULD DESTROY THE CRAFT AND US TOO IF HE COULD PREVENT US FROM DISCOVERING THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN I BELIEVE
8580-287364-0018 THEN WE MUST GET AHEAD OF HIM DECIDED TOM QUIETLY I HAVE JUST FLASHED TO DAD A MESSAGE TELLING HIM THAT WE WILL HEED HIS WARNING NOW TO CAPTURE THE STOWAWAY
8580-287364-0019 AND WHILE WE'RE ABOUT IT GIVE HIM A GOOD SCARE WHEN WE DO GET HIM SUGGESTED MISTER JENKS HOW ASKED TOM THREATEN TO DROP HIM OVERBOARD PERHAPS THAT WILL MAKE HIM TELL HOW HE HAPPENED TO GET IN OUR SHIP
8580-287364-0020 AND WHAT ARE THE PLANS OF THE GANG OF DIAMOND MAKERS WE MAY GET VALUABLE INFORMATION THAT WAY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU CAN SCARE SUCH FELLOWS MUCH WAS TOM'S OPINION
8580-287364-0021 HOW ARE YOU GOING TO CAPTURE HIM ASKED MISTER PARKER IF HE HAS A GUN IT WON'T BE ANY TOO EASY TO GO IN THE STOREROOM AND DRAG HIM OUT WE'LL HAVE TO USE A LITTLE STRATEGY DECIDED TOM AND THEN THEY DISCUSSED SEVERAL PLANS
8580-287364-0022 THE ONE FINALLY ADOPTED WAS THAT TOM AND MISTER DAMON SHOULD ENTER THE STOREROOM CASUALLY AS IF IN SEARCH OF FOOD TO COOK FOR SUPPER THEY WOULD DISCUSS VARIOUS DISHES AND MISTER DAMON WAS TO EXPRESS A PREFERENCE FOR SOMETHING IN THE FOOD LINE
8580-287364-0023 THE BOX CONTAINING WHICH WAS WELL BACK IN THE ROOM THIS WOULD GIVE THE TWO A CHANCE TO PENETRATE TO THE FAR END OF THE APARTMENT WITHOUT AROUSING THE SUSPICIONS OF THE HIDDEN MAN WHO DOUBTLESS WOULD BE LISTENING TO THE CONVERSATION AND AS SOON AS WE GET SIGHT OF HIM
8580-287364-0024 SAID TOM JUMP BEFORE HE HAS A CHANCE TO USE HIS GUN MISTER JENKS AND MISTER PARKER WILL BE WAITING OUTSIDE THE ROOM TO CATCH HIM IF HE GETS AWAY FROM US I'LL HAVE SOME ROPES READY AND WE'LL TIE HIM UP AND WELL WE'LL DECIDE LATER WHAT TO DO WITH HIM ALL RIGHT
8580-287364-0025 I'M READY AS SOON AS YOU ARE TOM SAID THE ECCENTRIC MAN COME AHEAD THEY WENT SOFTLY TO THE STOREROOM AND LISTENED AT THE DOOR THERE WAS NO SOUND HEARD SAVE THAT MADE BY THE MACHINERY I WONDER IF HE'S REALLY HERE
8580-287364-0026 WHISPERED MISTER DAMON WE'LL SOON FIND OUT ANSWERED TOM LET'S GO IN THEY ENTERED AND IN PURSUANCE OF THEIR PLAN TOM AND HIS FRIEND TALKED OF VARIOUS FOODS

8580-287364-0030 HE WAS AWARE OF A MOVEMENT IN A LITTLE SPACE FORMED BY ONE BOX WHICH WAS PLACED ON TOP OF TWO OTHERS THE LAD SAW A DARK FIGURE MOVING AS IF TO GET FARTHER OUT OF SIGHT I'VE GOT HIM CRIED TOM MAKING A DIVE FOR THE SHADOW

8580-287364-0044 AND THEN GO ON BEFORE YOU CAN SEND ANY WORD TO YOUR CONFEDERATES WE'LL PUT YOU OFF IN THE MOST LONESOME SPOT WE CAN FIND AND I GUESS YOU'LL BE SOME TIME GETTING BACK TO CIVILIZATION BY THAT TIME WE'LL HAVE THE SECRET OF THE DIAMONDS YOU NEVER WILL
8580-287364-0045 DECLARED THE MAN FIRMLY AND HE WOULD SAY NOTHING MORE THOUGH BY THREATS AND PROMISES MISTER JENKS TRIED TO GET FROM HIM SOMETHING ABOUT THE MEN IN WITH HIM AND WHERE THE CAVE OF THE DIAMONDS WAS LOCATED
8580-287364-0046 HEAVILY BOUND WITH ROPES THE MAN WAS LOCKED IN A SMALL CLOSET TO BE KEPT THERE UNTIL A FAVORABLE SPOT WAS REACHED FOR LETTING HIM GO MISTER JENKS PLAN
8580-287364-0047 WAS CONSIDERED A GOOD ONE THREE DAYS LATER IN CROSSING OVER A LONELY REGION NEAR THE NEBRASKA NATIONAL FOREST FARLEY MUNSON WHICH WAS ONE OF THE NAMES THE SPY WENT BY
8580-287364-0048 WAS DROPPED OFF THE AIRSHIP WHEN IT WAS SENT DOWN TO WITHIN A FEW FEET OF THE EARTH IT WILL TAKE YOU SOME TIME TO GET TO A TELEGRAPH OFFICE SAID MISTER JENKS AS A PACKAGE OF FOOD AND A FLASK OF WATER WAS TOSSED DOWN TO THE STOWAWAY
8580-287364-0049 HE SHOOK HIS FIST AT THOSE IN THE AIRSHIP AND SHOUTED AFTER THEM YOU'LL NEVER DISCOVER THE SECRET OF PHANTOM MOUNTAIN
8609-262281-0000 CHAPTER SIXTEEN MUCH TO ALTER AT THE SAME MOMENT CONSTANCE CHANNING WAS TRAVERSING THE BOUNDARIES ON HER WAY TO LADY AUGUSTA YORKE'S WHERE SHE HAD SOME DAYS SINCE COMMENCED HER DUTIES IT TOOK HER SCARCELY TWO MINUTES TO GET THERE FOR THE HOUSES WERE ALMOST WITHIN VIEW OF EACH OTHER
8609-262281-0001 CONSTANCE WOULD WILLINGLY HAVE COMMENCED THE DAILY ROUTINE AT AN EARLIER HOUR LADY AUGUSTA FREELY CONFESSED THAT TO COME EARLIER WOULD BE USELESS FOR SHE COULD NOT GET HER DAUGHTERS UP STRICTLY SPEAKING LADY AUGUSTA DID NOT PERSONALLY TRY TO GET THEM UP
8609-262281-0002 PREPARING THEIR LESSONS FANNY CAME RUNNING IN HER HAIR IN CURL PAPERS SOME BREAD AND BUTTER IN HER HAND CARRY HAS NOT FINISHED HER BREAKFAST MISS CHANNING QUOTH SHE SHE WAS LAZY THIS MORNING I THINK SOME ONE ELSE WAS LAZY ALSO SAID CONSTANCE GENTLY DRAWING THE CHILD TO HER

8609-262281-0005 BE SO KIND AS TO TAKE THE PAPERS OUT OF MISS FANNY'S HAIR AND LET IT BE DONE IN FUTURE MARTHA BEFORE SHE COMES TO ME GENTLY AS THE WORDS WERE SPOKEN THERE WAS NO MISTAKING THAT THE TONE WAS ONE OF AUTHORITY AND NOT TO BE TRIFLED WITH

8609-262281-0008 IT IS NOT FOR THAT I WISH TO GO SAID CAROLINE I THINK MEETINGS WHERE THERE'S NOTHING BUT TALKING ARE THE DULLEST THINGS IN THE WORLD IF I WERE TO LISTEN IT WOULD SEND ME TO SLEEP THEN WHY DO YOU WISH SO MUCH TO ATTEND THIS ONE BECAUSE I SHALL WEAR MY NEW DRESS
8609-262281-0009 I HAVE NOT HAD IT ON YET

8609-262281-0014 ANNABEL IS FOND OF TALKING NONSENSE BUT SHE IS A GOOD LOVING CHILD AT HEART
8609-262281-0015 I HAVE SO MUCH TO TEACH YOU CAROLINE TO YOUR MIND AND HEART AS WELL AS TO YOUR INTELLECT THAT I FEEL THE HOURS AS AT PRESENT ARRANGED WILL BE INSUFFICIENT FOR ME MY DEAR WHEN YOU GROW UP TO WOMANHOOD I AM SURE YOU WILL WISH TO BE LOVING AND LOVED
8609-262281-0016 CAROLINE BURST INTO TEARS I SHOULD DO BETTER IF MAMMA WERE NOT SO CROSS WITH ME MISS CHANNING I ALWAYS DO ANYTHING THAT WILLIAM YORKE ASKS ME AND I WILL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU CONSTANCE KISSED HER THEN WILL YOU BEGIN BY RISING EARLY AND BEING READY FOR ME AT SEVEN

8609-262281-0018 LADY AUGUSTA CAME IN AND PROFFERED THE INVITATION TO CONSTANCE TO ACCOMPANY THEM CONSTANCE THEN SPOKE OF GIVING THE CHILDREN THE EXTRA TWO HOURS FROM SEVEN TO NINE IT WAS REALLY NECESSARY SHE SAID IF SHE WAS TO DO HER DUTY BY THEM
8609-262281-0019 YOU WILL NEVER PUT UP WITH OUR SCRAMBLING BREAKFAST MISS CHANNING THE BOYS ARE SO UNRULY AND I DO NOT GET UP TO IT HALF MY TIME
8609-262281-0020 NOT VERY EARLY ANSWERED CONSTANCE HITHERTO I HAVE RISEN AT SEVEN SUMMER AND WINTER DRESSING AND READING TAKES ME JUST AN HOUR FOR THE OTHER HOUR I FIND PLENTY OF OCCUPATION WE DO NOT BREAKFAST UNTIL NINE ON ACCOUNT OF TOM AND CHARLEY I SHALL RISE AT SIX NOW
8609-262281-0021 AND COME HERE AT SEVEN VERY WELL SAID LADY AUGUSTA I SUPPOSE THIS WILL ONLY APPLY TO THE SUMMER MONTHS ONE OF THE GIRLS SHALL GO WITH US TO DAY WHICHEVER DESERVES IT BEST YOU ARE NOT LEAVING ONE OF THEM AT HOME TO MAKE ROOM FOR ME I HOPE LADY AUGUSTA
8609-262281-0022 NOT AT ALL ANSWERED LADY AUGUSTA I NEVER CHAPERON TWO CHILDREN TO A CROWDED MEETING PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THEY TOOK UP THE ROOM OF GROWN UP PERSONS YOU WILL LET ME GO NOT CAROLINE MISS CHANNING PLEADED FANNY WHEN HER MOTHER
8609-262281-0023 NO SAID CAROLINE SHARPLY MISS CHANNING WILL FIX UPON ME I SHALL OBEY LADY AUGUSTA
8609-262281-0024 IT WILL BE ONLY RIGHT TO DO SO SUPPOSE WE ARE BOTH GOOD AND MERIT IT EQUALLY SUGGESTED FANNY
8609-262281-0025 YOU MUST NOT BE DISAPPOINTED IF IN THAT CASE I GIVE THE PRIVILEGE TO CAROLINE AS BEING THE ELDER OF THE TWO BUT I WILL MAKE IT UP TO YOU IN SOME OTHER WAY ALAS FOR POOR CAROLINE'S RESOLUTION FOR A SHORT TIME AN HOUR OR SO SHE DID STRIVE TO DO HER BEST
8609-262281-0026 BUT THEN GOOD RESOLUTIONS WERE FORGOTTEN AND IDLENESS FOLLOWED NOT ONLY IDLENESS TEMPER ALSO
8609-262281-0027 SHE EVEN FORGOT HERSELF SO FAR AS TO BE INSOLENT FANNY WAS TAKEN TO THE MEETING YOU SAW HER IN THE CARRIAGE WHEN LADY AUGUSTA DROVE TO MISTER GALLOWAY'S OFFICE AND PERSUADED HAMISH TO JOIN THEM CAROLINE WAS LEFT AT HOME IN A STATE OF OPEN REBELLION WITH THE LESSONS TO LEARN
8609-262281-0028 WHICH SHE HAD NOT LEARNT IN THE DAY HOW SHALL YOU GET ON WITH THEM CONSTANCE THE REV WILLIAM YORKE INQUIRED OF HER THAT SAME EVENING HAVE THE WEEDS DESTROYED THE GOOD SEED NOT QUITE DESTROYED IT REPLIED CONSTANCE THOUGH SHE SIGHED SADLY AS SHE SPOKE
8609-262281-0029 THERE IS SO MUCH ILL TO UNDO CAROLINE IS THE WORST THE WEEDS WITH HER HAVE HAD LONGER TIME TO GET AHEAD I THINK PERHAPS IF I COULD KEEP HER WHOLLY WITH ME FOR A TWELVEMONTH OR SO WATCHING OVER HER CONSTANTLY A GREAT DEAL MIGHT BE EFFECTED
8609-262281-0030 IF THAT ANTICIPATED LIVING WOULD FALL IN WHICH SEEMS VERY FAR AWAY IN THE CLOUDS AND YOU WERE WHOLLY MINE WE MIGHT HAVE CAROLINE WITH US FOR A TIME LAUGHED MISTER YORKE CONSTANCE LAUGHED TOO DO NOT BE IMPATIENT
8609-262281-0031 OR IT WILL SEEM TO BE FURTHER OFF STILL IT WILL COME WILLIAM THEY HAD BEEN SPEAKING IN AN UNDERTONE STANDING TOGETHER AT A WINDOW APART FROM THE REST MISTER CHANNING WAS LYING ON HIS SOFA UNDERNEATH THE OTHER WINDOW AND NOW SPOKE TO MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0032 REPLIED MISTER CHANNING I THINK IT IS POSSIBLE THAT HIS EXPERIENCE IN ANOTHER LINE MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU CONTINUED MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0033 I HAVE HEARD SO HIS COMPLAINT WAS RHEUMATISM VERY MUCH AS I FANCY THE SAME SORT OF RHEUMATISM THAT AFFLICTS YOU HE TOLD ME HE CAME TO EUROPE WITH VERY LITTLE HOPE HE FEARED HIS COMPLAINT HAD BECOME CHRONIC AND INCURABLE
8609-262281-0034 BUT HE HAS BEEN RESTORED IN A WONDERFUL MANNER AND IS IN SOUND HEALTH AGAIN AND WHAT REMEDIES DID HE USE EAGERLY ASKED MISTER CHANNING A THREE MONTHS RESIDENCE AT SOME MEDICINAL SPRINGS IN GERMANY NOTHING ELSE WHEN I SAY NOTHING ELSE OF COURSE I MUST IMPLY THAT HE WAS UNDER MEDICAL TREATMENT THERE
8609-262281-0035 IT IS THE VERY THING YOU SEE SIR THAT HAS BEEN ORDERED FOR YOU AY SIGHED MISTER CHANNING FEELING HOW VERY FAINT APPEARED TO BE THE HOPE THAT HE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF TRYING IT I WAS MENTIONING YOUR CASE TO HIM OBSERVED MISTER YORKE
8609-262281-0036 THE CHANNINGS THEMSELVES WERE SILENT THEY COULD NOT SEE THE WAY AT ALL CLEAR WHEN MISTER YORKE WAS LEAVING HE BECKONED CONSTANCE AND ARTHUR INTO THE HALL
8609-262281-0037 THINK OF ALL THAT IS AT STAKE RENEWED HEALTH EXERTION HAPPINESS ARTHUR
8609-262281-0038 ARTHUR DID NOT FEEL HOPEFUL INDEED HIS HEART SANK WITHIN HIM THE WHOLE TIME THAT THEY WERE TALKING HAMISH AND HIS DIFFICULTIES WERE THE DARK SHADOW THOUGH HE COULD NOT TELL THIS TO MISTER YORKE WERE MISTER CHANNING TO GO ABROAD AND THE ARREST OF HAMISH TO FOLLOW UPON IT
8609-262281-0039 DOCTOR LAMB SAYS THE COST WAS SO TRIFLING AS SCARCELY TO BE CREDITED CONTINUED MISTER YORKE IN A TONE OF REMONSTRANCE ARTHUR DON'T YOU CARE TO HELP TO SAVE HIM I WOULD MOVE HEAVEN AND EARTH TO SAVE MY FATHER IMPULSIVELY SPOKE ARTHUR
8609-262281-0040 STUNG BY THE IMPLIED REPROOF I SHOULD NOT CARE WHAT LABOUR IT COST ME TO PROCURE THE MONEY SO THAT I SUCCEEDED WE ALL WOULD SAID CONSTANCE YOU MUST KNOW WE WOULD WILLIAM FROM HAMISH DOWNWARDS
8609-262281-0041 DID YOU THINK I WAS LOST I WAS SEDUCED INTO JOINING YOUR MISSIONARY MEETING PEOPLE AND HAVE HAD TO STOP LATE AT THE OFFICE TO MAKE UP FOR IT
8609-262281-0042 FRESH HOPE SEEMS TO ARISE DAILY THAT THOSE GERMAN BATHS WOULD RESTORE HIM TO HEALTH THEY CURED DOCTOR LAMB I SAY HAMISH THAT THE MONEY MUST BE FOUND FOR IT SOMEHOW ADDED MISTER YORKE FOUND OF COURSE IT SHALL BE FOUND CRIED GAY HAMISH
8609-262281-0043 I INTEND TO BE A CHIEF CONTRIBUTOR TO IT MYSELF BUT HIS JOKING WORDS AND CARELESS MANNER JARRED AT THAT MOMENT UPON THE SPIRIT BOTH OF ARTHUR AND CONSTANCE CHANNING WHY
8609-283227-0000 HE AND ANOTHER FARMER HIS NEIGHBOUR HAD BEEN SO OFTEN RE ELECTED CHURCHWARDENS THAT AT LAST THEY SEEMED TO HAVE GAINED A PRESCRIPTIVE RIGHT TO THE OFFICE AND THE FORM OF ELECTION FELL INTO DISUSE
8609-283227-0001 BEEN SAID ABOUT THE ELECTION OF A COLLEAGUE SO LITTLE SEEMED TO FALL TO THE DUTY OF THE CHURCHWARDEN THAT I REGARDED THE NEGLECT AS A TRIFLE AND WAS REMISS IN SETTING IT RIGHT I HAD THEREFORE TO SUFFER AS WAS JUST INDEED MISTER BROWNRIGG WAS NOT THE MAN TO HAVE POWER IN HIS HANDS UNCHECKED
8609-283227-0002 I HAD SO FAR RECOVERED THAT I WAS ABLE TO RISE ABOUT NOON AND GO INTO MY STUDY THOUGH I WAS VERY WEAK AND HAD NOT YET BEEN OUT WHEN ONE MORNING MISSUS PEARSON CAME INTO THE ROOM AND SAID PLEASE SIR
8609-283227-0003 CONFIDENT THERE MUST BE A GOOD REASON FOR IT AND SO TOLD MISSUS PEARSON TO SHOW HIM IN OH SIR I KNOW YOU WOULD BE VEXED IF YOU HADN'T BEEN TOLD HE EXCLAIMED AND I AM SURE YOU WILL NOT BE ANGRY WITH ME FOR TROUBLING YOU WHAT IS THE MATTER TOM I SAID
8609-283227-0004 WHICH WERE NECESSARY AND MUST BE DONE BEFORE ANOTHER WINTER I CONFESS I WAS RATHER PLEASED FOR I WANTED MY PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THE CHURCH WAS THEIR PROPERTY AND THAT IT WAS THEIR PRIVILEGE IF THEY COULD REGARD IT AS A BLESSING TO HAVE THE CHURCH TO KEEP IT IN DECENT ORDER AND REPAIR
8609-283227-0005 TO MY CHURCHWARDEN WE MUST CALL A VESTRY BEFORE LONG AND HAVE THIS LOOKED TO NOW MY PREDECESSOR HAD LEFT EVERYTHING OF THE KIND TO HIS CHURCHWARDENS AND THE INHABITANTS FROM THEIR SIDE HAD LIKEWISE LEFT THE WHOLE AFFAIR TO THE CHURCHWARDENS BUT MISTER BROWNRIGG
8609-283227-0006 WHO I MUST SAY HAD TAKEN MORE PAINS THAN MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED OF HIM TO MAKE HIMSELF ACQUAINTED WITH THE LEGALITIES OF HIS OFFICE DID NOT FAIL TO CALL A VESTRY TO WHICH AS USUAL NO ONE HAD RESPONDED WHEREUPON HE IMPOSED A RATE ACCORDING TO HIS OWN UNAIDED JUDGMENT THIS I BELIEVE
8609-283227-0007 HE DID DURING MY ILLNESS WITH THE NOTION OF PLEASING ME BY THE DISCOVERY THAT THE REPAIRS HAD BEEN ALREADY EFFECTED ACCORDING TO MY MIND NOR DID ANY ONE OF MY CONGREGATION THROW THE LEAST DIFFICULTY IN THE CHURCHWARDEN'S WAY AND NOW I MUST REFER TO ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE HISTORY OF MY PARISH
8609-283227-0008 THERE WAS A LITTLE CHAPEL DOWN A LANE LEADING FROM THE MAIN STREET OF THE VILLAGE IN WHICH THERE WAS SERVICE THREE TIMES EVERY SUNDAY
8609-283227-0009 AMONGST WHOM WERE THE FAMILIES OF TWO OR THREE FARMERS OF SUBSTANCE WHILE THE VILLAGE AND ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTRIBUTED A PORTION OF THE POOREST OF THE INHABITANTS A YEAR OR TWO BEFORE I CAME THEIR MINISTER DIED AND THEY HAD CHOSEN ANOTHER A VERY WORTHY MAN OF CONSIDERABLE ERUDITION
8609-283227-0010 BUT OF EXTREME VIEWS AS I HEARD UPON INSIGNIFICANT POINTS AND MOVED BY A GREAT DISLIKE TO NATIONAL CHURCHES AND EPISCOPACY THIS I SAY IS WHAT I HAD MADE OUT ABOUT HIM FROM WHAT I HAD HEARD
8609-283227-0011 AND MY READER WILL VERY PROBABLY BE INCLINED TO ASK BUT WHY WITH PRINCIPLES SUCH AS YOURS SHOULD YOU HAVE ONLY HEARSAY TO GO UPON WHY DID YOU NOT MAKE THE HONEST MAN'S ACQUAINTANCE IN SUCH A SMALL PLACE MEN SHOULD NOT KEEP EACH OTHER AT ARM'S LENGTH
8609-283227-0012 AND ANY READER WHO SAYS SO WILL SAY RIGHT ALL I HAVE TO SUGGEST FOR MYSELF IS SIMPLY A CERTAIN SHYNESS FOR WHICH I CANNOT ENTIRELY ACCOUNT BUT WHICH WAS PARTLY MADE UP OF FEAR TO INTRUDE OR OF BEING SUPPOSED TO ARROGATE TO MYSELF THE RIGHT OF MAKING ADVANCES
8609-283227-0013 PARTLY OF A DREAD LEST WE SHOULD NOT BE ABLE TO GET ON TOGETHER AND SO THE ATTEMPT SHOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING UNPLEASANTLY AWKWARD I DARESAY LIKEWISE THAT THE NATURAL SHELLINESS OF THE ENGLISH HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH IT AT ALL EVENTS I HAD NOT MADE HIS ACQUAINTANCE
8609-283227-0014 MISTER TEMPLETON THEN HAD REFUSED AS A POINT OF CONSCIENCE TO PAY THE CHURCH RATE WHEN THE COLLECTOR WENT ROUND TO DEMAND IT HAD BEEN SUMMONED BEFORE A MAGISTRATE IN CONSEQUENCE HAD SUFFERED A DEFAULT AND PROCEEDINGS BEING PUSHED FROM THE FIRST IN ALL THE PRIDE OF MISTER BROWNRIGG'S LEGALITY
8609-283227-0015 HAD ON THIS VERY DAY BEEN VISITED BY THE CHURCHWARDEN ACCOMPANIED BY A BROKER FROM THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN OF ADDICEHEAD AND AT THE VERY TIME WHEN I WAS HEARING OF THE FACT WAS SUFFERING DISTRAINT OF HIS GOODS THE PORCINE HEAD OF THE CHURCHWARDEN WAS NOT ON HIS SHOULDERS BY ACCIDENT NOR WITHOUT SIGNIFICANCE
8609-283227-0016 BUT I DID NOT WAIT TO UNDERSTAND ALL THIS NOW IT WAS ENOUGH FOR ME THAT TOM BORE WITNESS TO THE FACT THAT AT THAT MOMENT PROCEEDINGS WERE THUS DRIVEN TO EXTREMITY I RANG THE BELL FOR MY BOOTS AND TO THE OPEN MOUTHED DISMAY OF MISSUS PEARSON LEFT THE VICARAGE LEANING ON TOM'S ARM
8609-283227-0017 BUT SUCH WAS THE COMMOTION IN MY MIND THAT I HAD BECOME QUITE UNCONSCIOUS OF ILLNESS OR EVEN FEEBLENESS HURRYING ON IN MORE TERROR THAN I CAN WELL EXPRESS LEST I SHOULD BE TOO LATE I REACHED MISTER TEMPLETON'S HOUSE JUST AS A SMALL MAHOGANY TABLE WAS BEING HOISTED INTO A SPRING CART
8609-283227-0018 WHICH STOOD AT THE DOOR BREATHLESS WITH HASTE I WAS YET ABLE TO CALL OUT PUT THAT TABLE DOWN DIRECTLY AT THE SAME MOMENT MISTER BROWNRIGG APPEARED FROM WITHIN THE DOOR
8609-283227-0019 I THINK HE HAD NOT HEARD ME YOU SEE I'M PROMPT MISTER WALTON HE SAID BUT BLESS MY SOUL HOW ILL YOU LOOK WITHOUT ANSWERING HIM FOR I WAS MORE ANGRY WITH HIM THAN I OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN I REPEATED PUT THAT TABLE DOWN I TELL YOU THEY DID SO
8609-283227-0020 NOW I SAID CARRY IT BACK INTO THE HOUSE WHY SIR INTERPOSED MISTER BROWNRIGG IT'S ALL RIGHT YES I SAID AS RIGHT AS THE DEVIL WOULD HAVE IT
8609-283227-0021 I'M NOT SO SURE OF THAT I BELIEVE I HAD THE RIGHT TO BE CHAIRMAN AT THE VESTRY MEETING BUT INSTEAD OF EVEN LETTING ME KNOW YOU TOOK ADVANTAGE OF MY ILLNESS TO HURRY ON MATTERS TO THIS SHAMEFUL AND WICKED EXCESS I DID THE POOR MAN WRONG IN THIS FOR I BELIEVE HE HAD HURRIED THINGS REALLY TO PLEASE ME
8609-283227-0022 HIS FACE HAD LENGTHENED CONSIDERABLY BY THIS TIME AND ITS RUBICUND HUE DECLINED I DID NOT THINK YOU WOULD STAND UPON CEREMONY ABOUT IT SIR
8609-283227-0023 BEFORE SUCH A THING SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED I FEEL SO DISGRACED I AM ASHAMED TO LOOK MISTER TEMPLETON IN THE FACE CARRY THAT TABLE INTO THE HOUSE AGAIN DIRECTLY IT'S MY PROPERTY NOW INTERPOSED THE BROKER I'VE BOUGHT IT OF THE CHURCHWARDEN AND PAID FOR IT
8609-283227-0024 BUT I TELL YOU THE WHOLE AFFAIR IS ILLEGAL AND IF YOU CARRY AWAY THAT TABLE I SHALL SEE WHAT THE LAW WILL DO FOR ME I ASSURE YOU I WILL PROSECUTE YOU MYSELF YOU TAKE UP THAT MONEY OR I WILL IT WILL GO TO PAY COUNSEL I GIVE YOU MY WORD IF YOU DO NOT TAKE IT TO QUENCH STRIFE
8609-283227-0025 I STRETCHED OUT MY HAND BUT THE BROKER WAS BEFORE ME WITHOUT ANOTHER WORD HE POCKETED THE MONEY JUMPED INTO HIS CART WITH HIS MAN AND DROVE OFF LEAVING THE CHURCHWARDEN AND THE PARSON STANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE DISSENTING MINISTER WITH HIS MAHOGANY TABLE ON THE PATH BETWEEN THEM NOW MISTER BROWNRIGG I SAID
8609-283227-0026 LEND ME A HAND TO CARRY THIS TABLE IN AGAIN HE YIELDED NOT GRACIOUSLY THAT COULD NOT BE EXPECTED BUT IN SILENCE OH SIR INTERPOSED YOUNG TOM WHO HAD STOOD BY DURING THE DISPUTE LET ME TAKE IT YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO LIFT IT
8609-283227-0027 AND SO MISTER BROWNRIGG AND I BLUNDERED INTO THE LITTLE PARLOUR WITH OUR BURDEN NOT A GREAT ONE
8609-283227-0028 MISTER TEMPLETON SAT IN A WINDSOR CHAIR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM EVIDENTLY THE TABLE HAD BEEN CARRIED AWAY FROM BEFORE HIM LEAVING HIS POSITION UNCOVERED THE FLOOR WAS STREWED WITH THE BOOKS WHICH HAD LAIN UPON IT HE SAT READING AN OLD FOLIO AS IF NOTHING HAD HAPPENED
8609-283227-0029 BUT WHEN WE ENTERED HE ROSE HE WAS A MAN OF MIDDLE SIZE ABOUT FORTY WITH SHORT BLACK HAIR AND OVERHANGING BUSHY EYEBROWS HIS MOUTH INDICATED GREAT FIRMNESS NOT UNMINGLED WITH SWEETNESS AND EVEN WITH HUMOUR HE SMILED AS HE ROSE BUT LOOKED EMBARRASSED
8609-283227-0030 GLANCING FIRST AT THE TABLE THEN AT ME AND THEN AT MISTER BROWNRIGG AS IF BEGGING SOMEBODY TO TELL HIM WHAT TO SAY BUT I DID NOT LEAVE HIM A MOMENT IN THIS PERPLEXITY MISTER TEMPLETON I SAID QUITTING THE TABLE AND HOLDING OUT MY HAND
8609-283227-0031 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN ANNOYED LIKE THIS I HAVE MISTER TEMPLETON INTERRUPTED ME I ASSURE YOU IT WAS A MATTER OF CONSCIENCE WITH ME HE SAID ON NO OTHER GROUND I KNOW IT I KNOW IT I SAID INTERRUPTING HIM IN MY TURN
8609-283227-0032 I BEG YOUR PARDON AND I HAVE DONE MY BEST TO MAKE AMENDS FOR IT OFFENCES MUST COME YOU KNOW MISTER TEMPLETON BUT I TRUST I HAVE NOT INCURRED THE WOE THAT FOLLOWS UPON THEM BY MEANS OF WHOM THEY COME FOR I KNEW NOTHING OF IT AND INDEED WAS TOO ILL
8609-283227-0033 MISTER BROWNRIGG I SPOKE IN HEAT WHEN I CAME UP TO YOU AND I AM SURE I DID YOU WRONG I AM CERTAIN YOU HAD NO IMPROPER MOTIVE IN NOT MAKING ME ACQUAINTED WITH YOUR PROCEEDINGS YOU MEANT NO HARM TO ME BUT YOU DID VERY WRONG TOWARDS MISTER TEMPLETON I WILL TRY TO SHOW YOU THAT WHEN I AM WELL AGAIN
8609-283227-0034 BUT BUT YOU MUSTN'T TALK MORE NOW SAID DOCTOR DUNCAN SO I SHOOK HANDS WITH MISTER BROWNRIGG AND WE PARTED I FEAR FROM WHAT I KNOW OF MY CHURCHWARDEN THAT HE WENT HOME WITH THE CONVICTION THAT HE HAD DONE PERFECTLY RIGHT
8609-283227-0035 AND AMONGST THEM BY MISTER TEMPLETON AND HERE I MAY AS WELL SKETCH THE RESULT OF THAT STRANGE INTRODUCTION TO THE DISSENTING MINISTER
8609-283227-0036 THE GIST OF THE LETTER LAY IN THESE WORDS I CONFESS IT PERPLEXES ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO RECONCILE YOUR CHRISTIAN AND FRIENDLY BEHAVIOUR TO ONE WHOM MOST OF YOUR BRETHREN WOULD CONSIDER AS MUCH BENEATH THEIR NOTICE AS INFERIOR TO THEM IN SOCIAL POSITION
8609-283227-0037 WITH YOUR REMAINING THE MINISTER OF A CHURCH IN WHICH SUCH ENORMITIES AS YOU EMPLOYED YOUR PRIVATE INFLUENCE TO COUNTERACT IN MY CASE ARE NOT ONLY POSSIBLE BUT CERTAINLY LAWFUL AND RECOGNIZED BY MOST OF ITS MEMBERS AS LIKEWISE EXPEDIENT TO THIS I REPLIED
8609-283227-0038 MY DEAR SIR I DO NOT LIKE WRITING LETTERS ESPECIALLY ON SUBJECTS OF IMPORTANCE THERE ARE A THOUSAND CHANCES OF MISUNDERSTANDING WHEREAS IN A PERSONAL INTERVIEW THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF CONTROVERSY BEING HALLOWED BY COMMUNION
8609-283227-0039 TO MISSUS TEMPLETON FOR NOT INVITING HER WITH YOU
8609-283227-0040 HOW YOU COULD BELONG TO A CHURCH WHICH AUTHORIZES THINGS OF WHICH YOU YOURSELF SO HEARTILY DISAPPROVE AND I ANSWER YOU I RETURNED THAT JUST TO SUCH A CHURCH OUR LORD BELONGED I DO NOT QUITE UNDERSTAND YOU OUR LORD BELONGED TO THE JEWISH CHURCH
8609-283227-0041 I WANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW ME TO SHOW YOU THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH HE ACTED WITH REGARD TO CHURCH RATES CERTAINLY I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR INTERRUPTING YOU THE PHARISEES DEMANDED A TRIBUTE WHICH IT IS ALLOWED WAS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE TEMPLE AND ITS WORSHIP
8609-283227-0042 OUR LORD DID NOT REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR AUTHORITY NOTWITHSTANDING THE MANY WAYS IN WHICH THEY HAD DEGRADED THE RELIGIOUS OBSERVANCES OF THE JEWISH CHURCH HE ACKNOWLEDGED HIMSELF A CHILD OF THE CHURCH BUT SAID THAT AS A CHILD HE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN LEFT TO CONTRIBUTE AS HE PLEASED
8609-283227-0043 TO THE SUPPORT OF ITS ORDINANCES AND NOT TO BE COMPELLED AFTER SUCH A FASHION THERE I HAVE YOU EXCLAIMED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0044 I GRANT IT IT IS ENTIRELY WRONG A VERY UNCHRISTIAN PROCEEDING BUT OUR LORD DID NOT THEREFORE DESERT THE CHURCH AS YOU WOULD HAVE ME DO HE PAID THE MONEY LEST HE SHOULD OFFEND AND NOT HAVING IT OF HIS OWN HE HAD TO ASK HIS FATHER FOR IT
8609-283227-0045 OR WHAT CAME TO THE SAME THING MAKE A SERVANT OF HIS FATHER NAMELY A FISH IN THE SEA OF GALILEE
8609-283227-0046 IT IS WRONG TO COMPEL AND WRONG TO REFUSE THE PAYMENT OF A CHURCH RATE I DO NOT SAY EQUALLY WRONG IT IS MUCH WORSE TO COMPEL THAN TO REFUSE YOU ARE VERY GENEROUS RETURNED MISTER TEMPLETON
8609-283227-0047 MAY I HOPE THAT YOU WILL DO ME THE CREDIT TO BELIEVE THAT IF I SAW CLEARLY THAT THEY WERE THE SAME THING I WOULD NOT HESITATE A MOMENT TO FOLLOW OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE I BELIEVE IT PERFECTLY THEREFORE HOWEVER WE MAY DIFFER WE ARE IN REALITY AT NO STRIFE
8609-283227-0048 BUT IS THERE NOT THIS DIFFERENCE THAT OUR LORD WAS AS YOU SAY A CHILD OF THE JEWISH CHURCH WHICH WAS INDUBITABLY ESTABLISHED BY GOD NOW IF I CANNOT CONSCIENTIOUSLY BELONG TO THE SO CALLED ENGLISH CHURCH WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO PAY CHURCH RATE OR TRIBUTE
8609-283227-0049 SHALL I TELL YOU THE ARGUMENT THE ENGLISH CHURCH MIGHT THEN USE THE CHURCH MIGHT SAY THEN YOU ARE A STRANGER AND NO CHILD THEREFORE LIKE THE KINGS OF THE EARTH WE MAY TAKE TRIBUTE OF YOU SO YOU SEE IT WOULD COME TO THIS THAT DISSENTERS ALONE SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PAY CHURCH RATES
8609-283227-0050 WE BOTH LAUGHED AT THIS PUSHING OF THE ARGUMENT TO ILLEGITIMATE CONCLUSIONS THEN I RESUMED BUT THE REAL ARGUMENT IS THAT NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS SHOULD WE SEPARATE FROM EACH OTHER NOT FOR SUCH FAULTS OR ANY FAULTS SO LONG AS IT IS THE REPOSITORY OF THE TRUTH SHOULD YOU SEPARATE FROM THE CHURCH
8609-283227-0051 I WILL YIELD THE POINT WHEN YOU CAN SHOW ME THE SAME GROUND FOR BELIEVING THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND THE NATIONAL CHURCH APPOINTED SUCH BY GOD THAT I CAN SHOW YOU AND YOU KNOW ALREADY FOR RECEIVING THE JEWISH CHURCH AS THE APPOINTMENT OF GOD
8609-283227-0052 THAT WOULD INVOLVE A LONG ARGUMENT UPON WHICH THOUGH I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT UPON THE MATTER MYSELF I CANNOT SAY I AM PREPARED TO ENTER AT THIS MOMENT MEANTIME I WOULD JUST ASK YOU WHETHER YOU ARE NOT SUFFICIENTLY A CHILD OF THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
8609-283227-0053 HAVING RECEIVED FROM IT A THOUSAND INFLUENCES FOR GOOD IF IN NO OTHER WAY YET THROUGH YOUR FATHERS TO FIND IT NO GREAT HARDSHIP AND NOT VERY UNREASONABLE TO PAY A TRIFLE TO KEEP IN REPAIR ONE OF THE TABERNACLES IN WHICH OUR FOREFATHERS WORSHIPPED TOGETHER IF
8609-283227-0054 AS I HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW IN SOME IMPERFECT MEASURE GOD IS WORSHIPPED AND THE TRUTH IS PREACHED IN IT MOST WILLINGLY WOULD I PAY THE MONEY I OBJECT SIMPLY BECAUSE THE RATE IS COMPULSORY AND THEREIN YOU HAVE OUR LORD'S EXAMPLE TO THE CONTRARY
8609-283227-0055 A SILENCE FOLLOWED FOR I HAD TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST MAN WHO WAS THINKING I RESUMED A THOUSAND DIFFICULTIES WILL NO DOUBT COME UP TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER DO NOT SUPPOSE I AM ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU I BELIEVE THAT OUR FATHER OUR ELDER BROTHER
8609-283227-0056 AND THE SPIRIT THAT PROCEEDETH FROM THEM IS TEACHING YOU AS I BELIEVE I TOO AM BEING TAUGHT BY THE SAME WHY THEN SHOULD I BE ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE YOU OF ANYTHING WILL YOU NOT IN HIS GOOD TIME COME TO SEE WHAT HE WOULD HAVE YOU SEE
8609-283227-0057 I AM RELIEVED TO SPEAK MY MIND KNOWING HE WOULD HAVE US SPEAK OUR MINDS TO EACH OTHER BUT I DO NOT WANT TO PROSELYTIZE IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND YOU WILL PROBABLY DO SO ON DIFFERENT GROUNDS FROM ANY I GIVE YOU
8609-283227-0058 AND I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A UNIVERSITY LIKE YOU BUT I'M NO FOOL EITHER I HOPE DON'T BE OFFENDED AT MY QUESTION WOULDN'T YOU BE GLAD TO SEE ME OUT OF YOUR PARISH NOW I BEGAN TO SPEAK BUT HE WENT ON
8609-283227-0059 DON'T YOU REGARD ME AS AN INTERLOPER NOW ONE WHO HAS NO RIGHT TO SPEAK BECAUSE HE DOES NOT BELONG TO THE CHURCH GOD FORBID I ANSWERED IF A WORD OF MINE WOULD MAKE YOU LEAVE MY PARISH TO MORROW I DARE NOT SAY IT
8609-283227-0060 I DO NOT WANT TO INCUR THE REBUKE OF OUR LORD FOR SURELY THE WORDS FORBID HIM NOT INVOLVED SOME REBUKE WOULD IT NOT BE A FEARFUL THING THAT ONE SOUL BECAUSE OF A DEED OF MINE SHOULD RECEIVE A LESS PORTION OF ELEVATION OR COMFORT IN HIS JOURNEY TOWARDS HIS HOME
8609-283227-0061 ARE THERE NOT COUNTLESS MODES OF SAYING THE TRUTH YOU HAVE SOME OF THEM I HOPE I HAVE SOME
8609-283227-0062 WHO WILL NOT HEAR ME PREACH TO THEM IN THE NAME AND LOVE OF GOD MISTER TEMPLETON SPEAK THAT YOU DO KNOW AND TESTIFY THAT YOU HAVE SEEN YOU AND I WILL HELP EACH OTHER IN PROPORTION AS WE SERVE THE MASTER
8609-283227-0063 I ONLY SAY THAT IN SEPARATING FROM US YOU ARE IN EFFECT AND BY YOUR CONDUCT SAYING TO US DO NOT PREACH FOR YOU FOLLOW NOT WITH US I WILL NOT BE GUILTY OF THE SAME TOWARDS YOU YOUR FATHERS DID THE CHURCH NO END OF GOOD BY LEAVING IT
8609-283227-0064 BUT IT IS TIME TO UNITE NOW ONCE MORE FOLLOWED A SILENCE IF PEOPLE COULD ONLY MEET AND LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE FACE SAID MISTER TEMPLETON AT LENGTH THEY MIGHT FIND THERE WAS NOT SUCH A GULF BETWEEN THEM AS THEY HAD FANCIED AND SO WE PARTED
8609-283227-0065 NOW I DO NOT WRITE ALL THIS FOR THE SAKE OF THE CHURCH RATE QUESTION I WRITE IT TO COMMEMORATE THE SPIRIT IN WHICH MISTER TEMPLETON MET ME FOR IT IS OF CONSEQUENCE THAT TWO MEN WHO LOVE THEIR MASTER SHOULD RECOGNIZE EACH THAT THE OTHER DOES SO AND THEREUPON IF NOT BEFORE
8609-283227-0066 AND MANY A TIME ERE HIS DEATH WE CONSULTED TOGETHER ABOUT THINGS THAT BEFELL ONCE HE CAME TO ME ABOUT A LEGAL DIFFICULTY IN CONNEXION WITH THE DEED OF TRUST OF HIS CHAPEL AND ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT HELP HIM MYSELF I DIRECTED HIM TO SUCH HELP AS WAS THOROUGH
8609-283227-0067 AND COST HIM NOTHING I NEED NOT SAY HE NEVER BECAME A CHURCHMAN OR THAT I NEVER EXPECTED HE WOULD ALL HIS MEMORIES OF A RELIGIOUS CHILDHOOD ALL THE SOURCES OF THE INFLUENCES WHICH HAD REFINED AND ELEVATED HIM WERE SURROUNDED WITH OTHER ASSOCIATIONS
8609-283227-0068 THAN THOSE OF THE CHURCH AND HER FORMS THE CHURCH WAS HIS GRANDMOTHER NOT HIS MOTHER AND HE HAD NOT MADE ANY ACQUAINTANCE WITH HER TILL COMPARATIVELY LATE IN LIFE BUT WHILE I DO NOT SAY THAT HIS INTELLECTUAL OBJECTIONS TO THE CHURCH WERE LESS STRONG THAN THEY HAD BEEN
8609-283227-0069 I AM SURE THAT HIS FEELINGS WERE MODERATED EVEN CHANGED TOWARDS HER AND THOUGH THIS MAY SEEM OF NO CONSEQUENCE TO ONE WHO LOVES THE CHURCH MORE THAN THE BROTHERHOOD IT DOES NOT SEEM OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE TO ME WHO LOVE THE CHURCH BECAUSE OF THE BROTHERHOOD OF WHICH IT IS THE TYPE AND THE RESTORER
8609-283227-0070 IT WAS LONG BEFORE ANOTHER CHURCH RATE WAS LEVIED IN MARSHMALLOWS AND WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCE DID TAKE PLACE NO ONE DREAMED OF CALLING ON MISTER TEMPLETON FOR HIS SHARE IN IT BUT HAVING HEARD OF IT HE CALLED HIMSELF UPON THE CHURCHWARDEN MISTER BROWNRIGG STILL AND OFFERED THE MONEY CHEERFULLY
8629-261139-0000 ALL THE WITNESSES WHO HAD ANYTHING TO SAY HAD LONG AGO GIVEN IN THEIR TESTIMONY AND WHEN AT OR NEAR NOON
8629-261139-0001 IT WAS TO FIND IN TWO FACES ONLY ANY SIGNS OF THE EAGERNESS AND EXPECTANCY WHICH FILLED HIS OWN BREAST TO SUFFOCATION BUT AS THESE FACES WERE THOSE OF AGNES HALLIDAY AND AMABEL PAGE
8629-261139-0002 HE SOON RECOGNISED THAT HIS OWN JUDGMENT WAS NOT AT FAULT AND THAT NOTWITHSTANDING OUTWARD APPEARANCES AND THE LANGUID INTEREST SHOWN IN THE NOW LAGGING PROCEEDINGS
8629-261139-0003 BUT VITAL CONSEQUENCE FREDERICK WAS NOT VISIBLE IN THE GREAT HALL BUT THAT HE WAS NEAR AT HAND SOON BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE CHANGE SWEETWATER NOW SAW IN AMABEL
8629-261139-0004 FOR WHILE SHE HAD HITHERTO SAT UNDER THE UNIVERSAL GAZE WITH ONLY THE FAINT SMILE OF CONSCIOUS BEAUTY ON HER INSCRUTABLE FEATURES
8629-261139-0005 AND GLANCED AT THE GREAT DOOR OF ENTRANCE WITH AN EVIL EXPECTANCY THAT STARTLED EVEN SWEETWATER SO LITTLE HAD HE REALLY UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THE PASSIONS LABOURING IN THAT VENOMOUS BREAST
8629-261139-0006 SMILED AS SHE MET HIS EYE WITH THAT CURIOUS SLOW DIPPING OF HER DIMPLES WHICH HAD MORE THAN ONCE CONFOUNDED THE CORONER AND RENDERED HER AT ONCE THE ADMIRATION AND ABHORRENCE OF THE CROWD
8629-261139-0007 LOOKED AWAY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
8629-261139-0008 FROM WHICH HE HAD REMOVED THE RING WHICH UP TO THIS HOUR HE HAD INVARIABLY WORN ON HIS THIRD FINGER IN THIS GLANCE OF HERS AND THIS ACTION OF HIS BEGAN THE STRUGGLE THAT WAS TO MAKE THAT DAY MEMORABLE IN MANY HEARTS
8629-261139-0009 AND TO HIM A FULL ATTENTION WAS BEING GIVEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOME REAL ENLIGHTENMENT WOULD COME AT LAST TO SETTLE THE QUESTIONS WHICH HAD BEEN RAISED BY AMABEL'S INCOMPLETE AND UNSATISFACTORY TESTIMONY BUT NO MAN CAN FURNISH WHAT HE DOES NOT POSSESS
8629-261139-0010 AND THE FEW FINAL MINUTES BEFORE NOON PASSED BY WITHOUT ANY ADDITION BEING MADE TO THE FACTS WHICH HAD ALREADY BEEN PRESENTED FOR GENERAL CONSIDERATION AS THE WITNESS SAT DOWN THE CLOCK BEGAN TO STRIKE AS THE SLOW
8629-261139-0011 HESITATING STROKES RANG OUT SWEETWATER SAW FREDERICK YIELD TO A SUDDEN BUT MOST PROFOUND EMOTION THE OLD FEAR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND IF SWEETWATER DID NOT HAD AGAIN SEIZED THE VICTIM OF AMABEL'S AMBITION
8629-261139-0012 WITH A FELL AND STEADY PURPOSE HE FOUND HIS RIGHT HAND STEALING TOWARD THE LEFT IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION SHE EXPECTED BETTER TO YIELD THAN FALL HEADLONG INTO THE PIT ONE WORD OF HERS WOULD OPEN
8629-261139-0013 HE HAD NOT MEANT TO YIELD BUT NOW THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME NOW THAT HE MUST AT ONCE AND FOREVER CHOOSE BETWEEN A COURSE THAT LED SIMPLY TO PERSONAL UNHAPPINESS AND ONE THAT INVOLVED NOT ONLY HIMSELF
8629-261139-0014 BUT THOSE DEAREST TO HIM IN DISGRACE AND SORROW HE FELT HIMSELF WEAKEN TO THE POINT OF CLUTCHING AT WHATEVER WOULD SAVE HIM FROM THE CONSEQUENCES OF CONFESSION MORAL STRENGTH AND THAT TENACITY OF PURPOSE
8629-261139-0015 WHICH ONLY COMES FROM YEARS OF SELF CONTROL WERE TOO LATELY AWAKENED IN HIS BREAST TO SUSTAIN HIM NOW AS STROKE AFTER STROKE FELL ON THE EAR HE FELT HIMSELF YIELDING BEYOND RECOVERY
8629-261139-0016 AND HAD ALMOST TOUCHED HIS FINGER IN THE SIGNIFICANT ACTION OF ASSENT WHICH AMABEL AWAITED WITH BREATHLESS EXPECTATION WHEN WAS IT MIRACLE OR ONLY THE SUGGESTION OF HIS BETTER NATURE
8629-261139-0017 THE MEMORY OF A FACE FULL OF HOLY PLEADING ROSE FROM THE PAST BEFORE HIS EYES AND WITH AN INNER CRY OF MOTHER HE FLUNG HIS HAND OUT AND CLUTCHED HIS FATHER'S ARM IN A WAY TO BREAK THE CHARM OF HIS OWN DREAD
8629-261139-0018 AND END FOREVER THE EFFECTS OF THE INTOLERABLE FASCINATION THAT WAS WORKING UPON HIM NEXT MINUTE THE LAST STROKE OF NOON RANG OUT AND THE HOUR WAS UP WHICH AMABEL HAD SET AS THE LIMIT OF HER SILENCE A PAUSE
8629-261139-0019 WHICH TO THEIR TWO HEARTS IF TO NO OTHERS SEEMED STRANGELY APPROPRIATE FOLLOWED THE CESSATION OF THESE SOUNDS THEN THE WITNESS WAS DISMISSED AND AMABEL
8629-261139-0020 WHEN FREDERICK LEAPING WITH A BOUND TO HIS FEET DREW ALL EYES TOWARDS HIMSELF WITH THE CRY LET ME BE PUT ON MY OATH I HAVE TESTIMONY TO GIVE OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THIS CASE THE CORONER WAS ASTOUNDED
8629-261139-0021 EVERYONE WAS ASTOUNDED NO ONE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING FROM HIM AND INSTINCTIVELY EVERY EYE TURNED TOWARDS AMABEL TO SEE HOW SHE WAS AFFECTED BY HIS ACTION STRANGELY EVIDENTLY
8629-261139-0022 EVER FORGOT THOUGH IT CONVEYED NO HINT OF HER REAL FEELINGS WHICH WERE SOMEWHAT CHAOTIC FREDERICK WHO HAD FORGOTTEN HER NOW THAT HE HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO SPEAK WAITED FOR THE CORONER'S REPLY IF YOU HAVE TESTIMONY
8629-261139-0023 SAID THAT GENTLEMAN AFTER EXCHANGING A FEW HURRIED WORDS WITH MISTER COURTNEY AND THE SURPRISED KNAPP YOU CAN DO NO BETTER THAN GIVE IT TO US AT ONCE MISTER FREDERICK SUTHERLAND WILL YOU TAKE THE STAND
8629-261139-0024 WITH A NOBLE AIR FROM WHICH ALL HESITATION HAD VANISHED FREDERICK STARTED TOWARDS THE PLACE INDICATED BUT STOPPED BEFORE HE HAD TAKEN A HALF DOZEN STEPS
8629-261139-0025 GO HE WHISPERED BUT IN SO THRILLING A TONE IT WAS HEARD TO THE REMOTEST CORNER OF THE ROOM SPARE ME THE ANGUISH OF SAYING WHAT I HAVE TO SAY IN YOUR PRESENCE I COULD NOT BEAR IT YOU COULD NOT BEAR IT LATER
8629-261139-0026 IF YOU WILL WAIT FOR ME IN ONE OF THESE ROOMS I WILL REPEAT MY TALE IN YOUR EARS BUT GO NOW IT IS MY LAST ENTREATY THERE WAS A SILENCE NO ONE VENTURED A DISSENT
8629-261139-0027 NO ONE SO MUCH AS MADE A GESTURE OF DISAPPROVAL THEN MISTER SUTHERLAND STRUGGLED TO HIS FEET CAST ONE LAST LOOK AROUND HIM AND DISAPPEARED THROUGH A DOOR WHICH HAD OPENED LIKE MAGIC BEFORE HIM THEN AND NOT TILL THEN
8629-261139-0028 DID FREDERICK MOVE FORWARD THE MOMENT WAS INTENSE THE CORONER SEEMED TO SHARE THE UNIVERSAL EXCITEMENT
8629-261139-0029 THIS YOU WILL BELIEVE WHEN I TELL YOU THAT I WAS THE PERSON MISS PAGE FOLLOWED INTO MISSUS WEBB'S HOUSE AND WHOM SHE HEARD DESCEND THE STAIRS DURING THE MOMENT SHE CROUCHED BEHIND THE FIGURE OF THE SLEEPING PHILEMON IT WAS MORE
8629-261139-0030 INFINITELY MORE THAN ANYONE THERE HAD EXPECTED
8629-261139-0031 AND THE SHOCK THE SURPRISE
8629-261139-0032 WAS ALMOST APPALLING IN ITS INTENSITY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF MISTER SUTHERLAND'S NEAR PRESENCE THE FEELING WOULD HAVE RISEN TO OUTBREAK AND MANY VOICES WERE HELD IN SUBJECTION BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF THIS VENERATED MAN'S LAST LOOK
8629-261139-0033 THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE MADE THEMSELVES HEARD IN DESPITE OF THE RESTRICTIONS OF THE PLACE AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE POLICE TO FREDERICK IT WAS A MOMENT OF IMMEASURABLE GRIEF AND HUMILIATION
8629-261139-0034 ON EVERY FACE IN EVERY SHRINKING FORM IN SUBDUED MURMURS AND OPEN CRIES HE READ INSTANT AND COMPLETE CONDEMNATION AND YET IN ALL HIS LIFE FROM BOYHOOD UP TO THIS HOUR NEVER HAD HE BEEN SO WORTHY OF THEIR ESTEEM AND CONSIDERATION
8629-261139-0035 HE DID NOT LOSE HIS DETERMINED ATTITUDE HE HAD OBSERVED A CHANGE IN AMABEL AND A CHANGE IN AGNES AND IF ONLY TO DISAPPOINT THE VILE TRIUMPH OF THE ONE
8629-261139-0036 HE WITHSTOOD THE CLAMOUR AND BEGAN SPEAKING AGAIN BEFORE THE CORONER HAD BEEN ABLE TO FULLY RESTORE QUIET I KNOW SAID HE
8629-261139-0037 BUT IF ANYONE WHO LISTENS TO ME THINKS ME GUILTY OF THE DEATH I WAS SO UNFORTUNATE AS TO HAVE WITNESSED
8629-261139-0038 DOCTOR TALBOT AND YOU GENTLEMEN OF THE JURY IN THE FACE OF GOD AND MAN I HERE DECLARE THAT MISSUS WEBB IN MY PRESENCE AND BEFORE MY EYES
8629-261139-0039 GAVE TO HERSELF THE BLOW WHICH HAS ROBBED US ALL OF A MOST VALUABLE LIFE SHE WAS NOT MURDERED IT WAS A SOLEMN ASSERTION BUT IT FAILED TO CONVINCE THE CROWD BEFORE HIM AS BY ONE IMPULSE MEN AND WOMEN BROKE INTO A TUMULT
8629-261139-0040 SHE WAS TOO GOOD IT'S ALL CALUMNY A WRETCHED LIE BROKE IN UNRESTRAINED EXCITEMENT FROM EVERY PART OF THE LARGE ROOM IN VAIN THE CORONER SMOTE WITH HIS GAVEL IN VAIN THE LOCAL POLICE ENDEAVOURED TO RESTORE ORDER
8629-261139-0041 THE TIDE WAS UP AND OVER SWEPT EVERYTHING FOR AN INSTANT
8629-261139-0042 OF AMABEL SMOOTHING OUT THE FOLDS OF HER CRISP WHITE FROCK WITH AN INCREDULOUS ALMOST INSULTING SMILE THAT AT ONCE FIXED ATTENTION AGAIN ON FREDERICK HE SEIZED THE OCCASION AND SPOKE UP IN A TONE OF GREAT RESOLVE
8629-261139-0043 I HAVE MADE AN ASSERTION SAID HE BEFORE GOD AND BEFORE THIS JURY TO MAKE IT SEEM A CREDIBLE ONE I SHALL HAVE TO TELL MY OWN STORY FROM THE BEGINNING AM I ALLOWED TO DO SO MISTER CORONER YOU ARE
8629-261139-0044 WAS THE FIRM RESPONSE THEN GENTLEMEN CONTINUED FREDERICK STILL WITHOUT LOOKING AT AMABEL WHOSE SMILE HAD ACQUIRED A MOCKERY THAT DREW THE EYES OF THE JURY TOWARD HER MORE THAN ONCE DURING THE FOLLOWING RECITAL
8629-261139-0045 YOU KNOW AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY NOW KNOW THAT MISSUS WEBB HAS LEFT ME THE GREATER PORTION OF THE MONEY OF WHICH SHE DIED POSSESSED I HAVE NEVER BEFORE ACKNOWLEDGED TO ANYONE NOT EVEN TO THE GOOD MAN WHO AWAITS THIS JURY'S VERDICT
8629-261139-0046 ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT DOOR YONDER THAT SHE HAD REASONS FOR THIS GOOD REASONS REASONS OF WHICH UP TO THE VERY EVENING OF HER DEATH
8629-261139-0047 OR THAT I WAS THE SPECIAL OBJECT OF HER ATTENTION OR THAT WE WERE UNDER ANY MUTUAL OBLIGATIONS IN ANY WAY WHY THEN I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF GOING TO HER IN THE GREAT STRAIT IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF ON THAT DAY
8629-261139-0048 I CANNOT SAY I KNEW SHE HAD MONEY IN HER HOUSE THIS I HAD UNHAPPILY BEEN MADE ACQUAINTED WITH IN AN ACCIDENTAL WAY
8629-261139-0049 AND QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING A VERY UNSELFISH ACT STILL THIS WOULD NOT SEEM TO BE REASON ENOUGH FOR ME TO INTRUDE UPON HER LATE AT NIGHT WITH A PLEA FOR A LARGE LOAN OF MONEY HAD I NOT BEEN IN A DESPERATE CONDITION OF MIND
8629-261139-0050 WHICH MADE ANY ATTEMPT SEEM REASONABLE THAT PROMISED RELIEF FROM THE UNENDURABLE BURDEN OF A PRESSING AND DISREPUTABLE DEBT I WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE MONEY A GREAT DEAL OF MONEY AND I HAD TO HAVE IT AT ONCE
8629-261139-0051 AS I HAD BEEN TOLD EARLY IN THE EVENING A SMALL ENTERTAINMENT WAS BEING GIVEN WHICH WOULD INSURE ITS BEING OPEN EVEN AT SO LATE AN HOUR AS MIDNIGHT MISS PAGE WHO WILL I AM SURE PARDON THE INTRODUCTION OF HER NAME INTO THIS NARRATIVE
8629-261139-0052 HAS TAKEN PAINS TO DECLARE TO YOU THAT IN THE EXPEDITION SHE HERSELF MADE INTO TOWN THAT EVENING SHE FOLLOWED SOME PERSON'S STEPS DOWN HILL THIS IS VERY LIKELY TRUE AND THOSE STEPS WERE PROBABLY MINE FOR AFTER LEAVING THE HOUSE BY THE GARDEN DOOR
8629-261139-0053 AND SO HASTENED ON TILL I CAME TO THE GATE ON HIGH STREET HERE I HAD A MOMENT OF HESITATION AND THOUGHTS BITTER ENOUGH FOR ME TO RECALL THEM AT THIS MOMENT CAME INTO MY MIND
8629-261139-0054 BUT THEY PASSED THANK GOD AND WITH NO MORE DESPERATE FEELING THAN A SULLEN INTENTION OF HAVING MY OWN WAY ABOUT THIS MONEY I LIFTED THE LATCH OF THE FRONT DOOR AND STEPPED IN
8629-261139-0055 OR AT LEAST TO HEAR THE SOUND OF MERRY VOICES AND LAUGHTER IN THE ROOMS ABOVE BUT NO SOUNDS OF ANY SORT AWAITED ME INDEED THE HOUSE SEEMED STRANGELY SILENT FOR ONE SO FULLY LIGHTED AND ASTONISHED AT THIS
8629-261139-0056 I PUSHED THE DOOR AJAR AT MY LEFT AND LOOKED IN AN UNEXPECTED AND PITIFUL SIGHT AWAITED ME
8629-261139-0057 I SAW THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE WITH HIS HEAD SUNK FORWARD ON HIS ARMS ASLEEP THE EXPECTED GUESTS HAD FAILED TO ARRIVE AND HE TIRED OUT WITH WAITING HAD FALLEN INTO A DOZE AT THE BOARD
8629-261139-0058 THIS WAS A CONDITION OF THINGS FOR WHICH I WAS NOT PREPARED MISSUS WEBB WHOM I WISHED TO SEE WAS PROBABLY UP STAIRS AND WHILE I MIGHT SUMMON HER BY A STURDY RAP ON THE DOOR BESIDE WHICH I STOOD I HAD SO LITTLE DESIRE TO WAKE HER HUSBAND
8629-261139-0059 OF WHOSE MENTAL CONDITION I WAS WELL AWARE THAT I COULD NOT BRING MYSELF TO MAKE ANY LOUD NOISE WITHIN HIS HEARING YET I HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RETREAT ALL MY HOPE OF RELIEF FROM THE MANY DIFFICULTIES THAT MENACED ME
8629-261139-0060 LAY IN THE GENEROSITY OF THIS GREAT HEARTED WOMAN AND IF OUT OF PUSILLANIMITY
8629-261139-0061 NOTHING BUT SHAME AND DISASTER AWAITED ME YET HOW COULD I HOPE TO LURE HER DOWN STAIRS WITHOUT NOISE I COULD NOT AND SO YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE MOMENT WITHOUT ANY REALISATION
8629-261139-0062 I SLIPPED UP THE NARROW STAIRCASE
8629-261139-0063 FOR SHE ROSE AND MEETING MY EYE WITH A GAZE IN WHICH SHOCK AND SOME STRANGE AND POIGNANT AGONY TOTALLY INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO ME WERE STRANGELY BLENDED SHE CRIED OUT NO NO FREDERICK YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
8629-261139-0064 IF YOU WANT MY MONEY TAKE IT IF YOU WANT MY LIFE
8629-261139-0065 DON'T STAIN YOURS DON'T I DID NOT UNDERSTAND HER I DID NOT KNOW UNTIL I THOUGHT IT OVER AFTERWARD THAT MY HAND WAS THRUST CONVULSIVELY INTO MY BREAST IN A WAY WHICH TAKEN WITH MY WILD MIEN
8629-261139-0066 GIVE THEN I WANT HUNDREDS THOUSANDS NOW NOW TO SAVE MYSELF DISGRACE SHAME PRISON AWAIT ME IF I DON'T HAVE THEM GIVE GIVE AND MY HAND WENT OUT TOWARD IT NOT TOWARD HER
8629-261139-0067 BUT SHE MISTOOK THE ACTION MISTOOK MY PURPOSE AND
8629-261139-0068 MORE THAN THE OUTWARD SEEMING OF HER LIFE CAN HARDLY MEASURE PLUNGED AGAINST IT AND I CAN TELL YOU NO MORE HER BLOOD AND BATSY'S SHRIEK FROM THE ADJOINING ROOM SWAM THROUGH MY CONSCIOUSNESS AND THEN SHE FELL AS I SUPPOSED
8629-261139-0069 AND I IN SCARCELY BETTER CASE FELL ALSO THIS AS GOD LIVES IS THE TRUTH CONCERNING THE WOUND FOUND IN THE BREAST OF THIS NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN WOMAN THE FEELING THE PATHOS THE ANGUISH EVEN TO BE FOUND IN HIS TONE MADE THIS STORY
8629-261139-0070 SEEMED APPEAR FOR THE MOMENT PLAUSIBLE AND BATSY ASKED THE CORONER MUST HAVE FALLEN WHEN WE DID FOR I NEVER HEARD HER VOICE AFTER THE FIRST SCREAM BUT I SHALL SPEAK OF HER AGAIN
8629-261139-0071 WHAT I MUST NOW EXPLAIN IS HOW THE MONEY IN MISSUS WEBB'S DRAWER CAME INTO MY POSSESSION AND HOW THE DAGGER SHE HAD PLANTED IN HER BREAST CAME TO BE FOUND ON THE LAWN OUTSIDE WHEN I CAME TO MYSELF AND THAT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY SOON I FOUND
8629-261139-0072 THAT THE BLOW OF WHICH I HAD BEEN SUCH A HORRIFIED WITNESS HAD NOT YET PROVED FATAL THE EYES I HAD SEEN CLOSE AS I HAD SUPPOSED FOREVER WERE NOW OPEN AND SHE WAS LOOKING AT ME WITH A SMILE THAT HAS NEVER LEFT MY MEMORY AND NEVER WILL
8629-261139-0073 THERE IS NO BLOOD ON YOU SHE MURMURED YOU DID NOT STRIKE THE BLOW
8629-261139-0074 THERE ARE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS ON THAT TABLE TAKE THEM AND LET THEM PAVE YOUR WAY TO A BETTER LIFE
8629-261139-0075 DO THESE WORDS THIS ACTION OF HERS SEEM INCREDIBLE TO YOU SIRS ALAS ALAS THEY WILL NOT WHEN I TELL YOU AND HERE HE CAST ONE ANXIOUS DEEPLY ANXIOUS GLANCE AT THE ROOM IN WHICH MISTER SUTHERLAND WAS HIDDEN
8629-261139-0076 THAT UNKNOWN TO ME UNKNOWN TO ANYONE LIVING BUT HERSELF UNKNOWN TO THAT GOOD MAN FROM WHOM IT CAN NO LONGER BE KEPT HIDDEN AGATHA WEBB WAS MY MOTHER
8629-261140-0000 AND GRADUALLY SUBSIDE SO THIS CROWD YIELDED TO ITS AWE AND MAN BY MAN SANK BACK INTO HIS SEAT TILL QUIET WAS AGAIN RESTORED AND ONLY A CIRCLE OF LISTENING FACES CONFRONTED THE MAN WHO HAD JUST STIRRED A WHOLE ROOMFUL TO ITS DEPTHS
8629-261140-0001 SEEING THIS AND REALISING HIS OPPORTUNITY FREDERICK AT ONCE ENTERED INTO THE EXPLANATIONS FOR WHICH EACH HEART THERE PANTED THIS WILL BE OVERWHELMING NEWS TO HIM WHO HAS CARED FOR ME SINCE INFANCY
8629-261140-0002 YOU HAVE HEARD HIM CALL ME SON WITH WHAT WORDS SHALL I OVERTHROW HIS CONFIDENCE IN THE TRUTH AND RECTITUDE OF HIS LONG BURIED WIFE AND MAKE HIM KNOW IN HIS OLD AGE THAT HE HAS WASTED YEARS OF PATIENCE UPON ONE WHO WAS NOT OF HIS BLOOD
8629-261140-0003 OR LINEAGE THE WONDER THE INCREDULITY YOU MANIFEST ARE MY BEST EXCUSE FOR MY LONG DELAY IN REVEALING THE SECRET ENTRUSTED TO ME BY THIS DYING WOMAN AN AWED SILENCE GREETED THESE WORDS
8629-261140-0004 THE ASTOUNDING FACT WHICH I HAVE JUST COMMUNICATED TO YOU WAS MADE KNOWN BY MY MOTHER WITH THE DAGGER STILL PLUNGED IN HER BREAST SHE WOULD NOT LET ME DRAW IT OUT SHE KNEW THAT DEATH WOULD FOLLOW THAT ACT
8629-261140-0005 AND SHE PRIZED EVERY MOMENT REMAINING TO HER BECAUSE OF THE BLISS SHE ENJOYED OF SEEING
8629-261140-0006 THE LOVE THE PASSION
8629-261140-0007 TRANSFORMED ME IN AN INSTANT FROM A SELFISH BRUTE INTO A DEEPLY REPENTANT MAN I KNELT BEFORE HER IN ANGUISH I MADE HER FEEL THAT WICKED AS I HAD BEEN I WAS NOT
8629-261140-0008 AND WHEN I SAW BY HER CLEARING BROW AND PEACEFUL LOOK THAT I HAD FULLY PERSUADED HER OF THIS I LET HER SPEAK WHAT WORDS SHE WOULD AND TELL AS SHE WAS ABLE
8629-261140-0009 IT IS A SACRED STORY TO ME AND IF YOU MUST KNOW IT LET IT BE FROM HER OWN WORDS IN THE LETTERS SHE LEFT BEHIND HER SHE ONLY TOLD ME THAT TO SAVE ME FROM THE FATE OF THE CHILDREN WHO HAD PRECEDED ME
8629-261140-0010 AND UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES CALCULATED TO DECEIVE MISTER SUTHERLAND CONSEQUENTLY HE HAD NEVER KNOWN I WAS NOT HIS OWN CHILD
8629-261140-0011 SHE ENJOINED ME NOT TO ENLIGHTEN HIM NOW IF BY ANY SACRIFICE ON MY PART I COULD RIGHTFULLY AVOID IT THAT SHE WAS HAPPY IN HAVING ME HEAR THE TRUTH BEFORE SHE DIED THAT THE JOY WHICH THIS GAVE HER WAS SO GREAT
8629-261140-0012 SHE DID NOT REGRET HER FATAL ACT VIOLENT AND UNCALLED FOR AS IT WAS FOR IT HAD SHOWED HER MY HEART AND ALLOWED ME TO READ HERS
8629-261140-0013 AND SHE MADE ME PROMISE I WOULD CARE FOR HIM TO THE LAST WITH TENDERNESS SAYING THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THIS WITHOUT SEEMING IMPROPRIETY SINCE SHE HAD WILLED ME ALL HER FORTUNE UNDER THIS PROVISO FINALLY
8629-261140-0014 AND THOUGH HER STRENGTH AND BREATH WERE FAST FAILING HER SHE MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS WORRIED ABOUT THE ZABELS WHO HAD NOT COME ACCORDING TO A SACRED CUSTOM BETWEEN THEM TO CELEBRATE THE ANNIVERSARY OF HER WEDDING
8629-261140-0015 AND PRAYED ME TO SEE THE TWO OLD GENTLEMEN BEFORE I SLEPT SINCE NOTHING BUT DEATH OR DIRE DISTRESS WOULD HAVE KEPT THEM FROM GRATIFYING THE ONE WHIM OF MY FATHER'S FAILING MIND I PROMISED
8629-261140-0016 SHE POINTED TO THE DAGGER IN HER BREAST BUT BEFORE I COULD LAY MY HAND UPON IT SHE CALLED FOR BATSY I WANT HER TO HEAR ME DECLARE BEFORE I GO SAID SHE THAT THIS STROKE WAS DELIVERED BY MYSELF UPON MYSELF
8629-261140-0017 BUT WHEN I ROSE TO LOOK FOR BATSY I FOUND THAT THE SHOCK OF HER MISTRESS'S FATAL ACT HAD KILLED HER
8629-261140-0018 IN CASE MY PRESENCE IN THIS HOUSE OF DEATH SHOULD BECOME KNOWN
8629-261140-0019 FOR FEAR IT WOULD MAKE HER LAST MOMENTS MISERABLE
8629-261140-0020 BUT WAS TOO TERRIFIED TO MOVE OR SPEAK AND THIS SATISFIED MY MOTHER AND MADE HER LAST BREATH ONE OF TRUST AND CONTENTED LOVE SHE DIED AS I DREW THE DAGGER FROM HER BREAST
8629-261140-0021 AND FLUNG IT WILDLY FROM THE WINDOW THEN I LIFTED HER AND LAID HER WHERE YOU FOUND HER ON THE SOFA
8629-261140-0022 JAMES ZABEL MUCH LESS THAT IT BORE HIS INITIALS ON THE HANDLE HE PAUSED AND THE AWE OCCASIONED BY THE SCENE HE HAD DESCRIBED WAS SO DEEP AND THE SILENCE SO PROLONGED THAT A SHUDDER PASSED OVER THE WHOLE ASSEMBLAGE
8629-261140-0023 WHEN FROM SOME UNKNOWN QUARTER A SINGLE CUTTING VOICE AROSE IN THIS ONE SHORT MOCKING COMMENT OH THE FAIRY TALE WAS IT AMABEL WHO SPOKE SOME THOUGHT SO AND LOOKED HER WAY
8629-261140-0024 AS IF BEGGING PARDON FOR THE WICKED DOUBTS WHICH HAD DRIVEN HIM TO THIS DEFENCE FREDERICK MET THAT LOOK WITH ONE SO SEVERE IT PARTOOK OF HARSHNESS THEN RESUMING HIS TESTIMONY HE SAID
8629-261140-0025 AND OF HOW ONE OF THEM JAMES BY NAME CAME TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS AFFAIR WHEN I LEFT MY DEAD MOTHER'S SIDE I WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF MIND THAT I PASSED WITH SCARCELY SO MUCH AS A GLANCE THE ROOM WHERE MY NEW FOUND FATHER SAT SLEEPING
8629-261140-0026 BUT AS I HASTENED ON TOWARD THE QUARTER WHERE THE ZABELS LIVED I WAS SEIZED BY SUCH COMPUNCTION FOR HIS DESOLATE STATE THAT I FALTERED IN MY RAPID FLIGHT AND DID NOT ARRIVE AT THE PLACE OF MY DESTINATION AS QUICKLY AS I INTENDED WHEN I DID
8629-261140-0027 BUT I DID NOT TURN AWAY REMEMBERING MY MOTHER'S ANXIETY AN ANXIETY SO EXTREME IT DISTURBED HER FINAL MOMENTS I APPROACHED THE FRONT DOOR AND WAS ABOUT TO KNOCK WHEN I FOUND IT OPEN GREATLY ASTONISHED I AT ONCE PASSED IN
8629-261140-0028 AND SEEING MY WAY PERFECTLY IN THE MOONLIGHT ENTERED THE ROOM ON THE LEFT THE DOOR OF WHICH ALSO STOOD OPEN IT WAS THE SECOND HOUSE I HAD ENTERED UNANNOUNCED THAT NIGHT AND IN THIS AS IN THE OTHER
8629-261140-0029 I ENCOUNTERED A MAN SITTING ASLEEP BY THE TABLE IT WAS JOHN THE ELDER OF THE TWO AND PERCEIVING THAT HE WAS SUFFERING FOR FOOD AND IN A CONDITION OF EXTREME MISERY I TOOK OUT THE FIRST BILL MY HAND ENCOUNTERED
8629-261140-0030 AS I DID SO HE GAVE A SIGH BUT DID NOT WAKE
8629-261140-0031 I HASTENED AWAY AND TOOK THE SHORTEST PATH HOME HAD I BEEN MORE OF A MAN OR IF MY VISIT TO MISSUS WEBB HAD BEEN ACTUATED BY A MORE COMMUNICABLE MOTIVE I WOULD HAVE GONE AT ONCE TO THE GOOD MAN WHO BELIEVED ME TO BE OF HIS OWN FLESH AND BLOOD
8629-261140-0032 AND TOLD HIM OF THE STRANGE AND HEART RENDING ADVENTURE WHICH HAD CHANGED THE WHOLE TENOR OF MY THOUGHTS AND LIFE
8629-261140-0033 IN WHICH I FOUND MYSELF PLACED BUT THE MEMORY OF A THOUSAND PAST INGRATITUDES TOGETHER WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE SHOCK WHICH HE COULD NOT FAIL TO RECEIVE ON LEARNING AT THIS LATE DAY
8629-261140-0034 WAS NEITHER OF HER BLOOD NOR HIS ROSE UP BETWEEN US AND CAUSED ME NOT ONLY TO ATTEMPT SILENCE BUT TO SECRETE IN THE ADJOINING WOODS THE MONEY I HAD RECEIVED IN THE VAIN HOPE THAT ALL VISIBLE CONNECTION BETWEEN MYSELF AND MY MOTHER'S TRAGIC DEATH
8629-261140-0035 WOULD THUS BE LOST YOU SEE I HAD NOT CALCULATED ON MISS AMABEL PAGE
8629-261140-0036 STARTLED THE CROWD AND GAVE SWEETWATER ALREADY SUFFERING UNDER SHOCK AFTER SHOCK OF MINGLED SURPRISE AND WONDER
8629-261140-0037 AND THAT SOMETHING BESIDES JUSTICE HAD ACTUATED AMABEL IN HER TREATMENT OF THIS YOUNG MAN THIS FEELING WAS SHARED BY OTHERS AND A REACTION SET IN IN FREDERICK'S FAVOUR WHICH EVEN AFFECTED THE OFFICIALS WHO WERE CONDUCTING THE INQUIRY
8629-261140-0038 FREDERICK HIMSELF FELT THE CHANGE AND SHOWED IT BY THE LOOK OF RELIEF AND GROWING CONFIDENCE HE CAST AT AGNES OF THE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS WHICH NOW PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE VARIOUS MEMBERS OF THE JURY I NEED GIVE NO ACCOUNT
8629-261140-0039 THEY BUT EMPHASISED FACTS ALREADY KNOWN AND PRODUCED BUT LITTLE CHANGE IN THE GENERAL FEELING
8629-261140-0040 WHEN HE WAS ALLOWED TO RESUME HIS SEAT
8629-261140-0041 SHE ROSE WITH A BOUND NOUGHT THAT SHE HAD ANTICIPATED HAD OCCURRED FACTS OF WHICH SHE COULD KNOW NOTHING HAD CHANGED THE ASPECT OF AFFAIRS AND MADE THE POSITION OF FREDERICK SOMETHING SO REMOTE FROM ANY SHE COULD HAVE IMAGINED
8629-261140-0042 THAT SHE WAS STILL IN THE MAZE OF THE NUMBERLESS CONFLICTING EMOTIONS WHICH THESE REVELATIONS WERE CALCULATED TO CALL OUT IN ONE WHO HAD RISKED ALL ON THE HAZARD OF A DIE AND LOST SHE DID NOT EVEN KNOW AT THIS MOMENT WHETHER SHE WAS GLAD OR SORRY HE COULD EXPLAIN SO CLEVERLY
8629-261140-0043 SHE HAD NOT A PURE ENOUGH HEART TO DO SO TO HER ALL SELF SACRIFICE WAS AN ANOMALY NO WOMAN OF THE MENTAL OR PHYSICAL STRENGTH OF AGATHA WEBB WOULD PLANT A DAGGER IN HER OWN BREAST JUST TO PREVENT ANOTHER PERSON FROM COMMITTING A CRIME
8629-261140-0044 WERE HE LOVER HUSBAND OR SON SO AMABEL BELIEVED AND SO WOULD THESE OTHERS BELIEVE ALSO WHEN ONCE RELIEVED OF THE MAGNETIC PERSONALITY OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY WITNESS
8629-261140-0045 YET HOW THRILLING IT HAD BEEN TO HEAR HIM PLEAD HIS CAUSE SO WELL IT WAS ALMOST WORTH THE LOSS OF HER REVENGE TO MEET HIS LOOK OF HATE AND DREAM OF THE POSSIBILITY OF TURNING IT LATER INTO THE OLD LOOK OF LOVE YES YES SHE LOVED HIM NOW
8629-261140-0046 NOT EVEN FOR HIS MONEY FOR SHE COULD CONTEMPLATE ITS LOSS BUT FOR HIMSELF WHO HAD SO BOLDLY SHOWN THAT HE WAS STRONGER THAN SHE AND COULD TRIUMPH OVER HER BY THE SHEER FORCE OF HIS MASCULINE DARING
8629-261140-0047 WITH SUCH FEELINGS
8629-261140-0048 HOW CONDUCT HERSELF UNDER QUESTIONS WHICH WOULD BE MUCH MORE SEARCHING NOW THAN BEFORE SHE COULD NOT EVEN DECIDE IN HER OWN MIND SHE MUST LET IMPULSE HAVE ITS WAY HAPPILY SHE TOOK THE RIGHT STAND AT FIRST
8629-261140-0049 SHE DID NOT ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE ANY CORRECTIONS IN HER FORMER TESTIMONY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE FLOWER WHOSE PRESENCE ON THE SCENE OF DEATH HAD BEEN SUCH A MYSTERY HAD FALLEN FROM HER HAIR AT THE BALL AND THAT SHE HAD SEEN FREDERICK PICK IT UP AND PUT IT IN HIS BUTTONHOLE
8629-261140-0050 BEYOND THIS AND THE INFERENCES IT AFTERWARD AWAKENED IN HER MIND SHE WOULD NOT GO
8630-305212-0000 CHAPTER FIVE HOW AUGUSTINE WENT TO CARTHAGE AND HOW PATRICIUS DIED A CHRISTIAN DEATH AUGUSTINE'S YEAR AT HOME DID NOT DO FOR HIM WHAT MONICA HAD HOPED
8630-305212-0001 HIS OLD PAGAN SCHOOLFELLOWS GATHERED ROUND HIM HE WAS ALWAYS WITH THEM THE HAPPY HOME LIFE SEEMED TO HAVE LOST ITS CHARM THE WANT OF PRINCIPLE AND OF HONOUR IN MOST OF THEM
8630-305212-0002 DISGUSTED HIM IN HIS BETTER MOMENTS NEVERTHELESS HE WAS CONTENT TO ENJOY HIMSELF IN THEIR COMPANY HE WAS EVEN ASHAMED WHEN THEY BOASTED OF THEIR MISDOINGS TO SEEM MORE INNOCENT THAN THEY
8630-305212-0003 AND WOULD PRETEND TO BE WORSE THAN HE REALLY WAS LEST HIS PRESTIGE SHOULD SUFFER IN THEIR EYES THERE WERE MOMENTS WHEN HE LOATHED IT ALL AND LONGED FOR THE OLD LIFE WITH ITS INNOCENT PLEASURES
8630-305212-0004 BUT IT IS HARD TO TURN BACK ON THE DOWNHILL ROAD HE TELLS US HOW HE WENT ONE NIGHT WITH A BAND OF THESE WILD COMPANIONS TO ROB THE FRUIT TREE OF A POOR NEIGHBOUR IT WAS LADEN WITH PEARS
8630-305212-0005 BUT THEY WERE NOT VERY GOOD THEY DID NOT CARE TO EAT THEM AND THREW THEM TO THE PIGS IT WAS NOT SCHOOLBOY GREED THAT PROMPTED THE THEFT BUT THE PURE DELIGHT OF DOING EVIL
8630-305212-0006 OF TRICKING THE OWNER OF THE GARDEN THERE WAS THE WILD EXCITEMENT TOO OF THE DARING THE FEAR THAT THEY MIGHT BE CAUGHT IN THE ACT HE WAS CAREFUL TO KEEP SUCH ESCAPADES A SECRET FROM HIS MOTHER BUT MONICA WAS UNEASY
8630-305212-0007 KNOWING WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE COMPANIONS HER SON HAD CHOSEN PATRICIUS WAS ALTOGETHER UNABLE TO GIVE AUGUSTINE THE HELP THAT HE NEEDED THE CHRISTIAN IDEALS OF LIFE AND CONDUCT WERE NEW TO HIM AS YET
8630-305212-0008 THE OLD PAGAN WAYS SEEMED ONLY NATURAL HE WAS SCARCELY LIKELY TO BE ASTONISHED AT THE FACT THAT HIS SON'S BOYHOOD WAS RATHER LIKE WHAT HIS OWN HAD BEEN HE WAS STANDING IT IS TRUE ON THE THRESHOLD OF THE CHURCH
8630-305212-0009 BUT HER TEACHING WAS NOT YET CLEAR TO HIM HIS OWN FEET WERE NOT FIRM ENOUGH IN THE WAYS OF CHRIST TO ENABLE HIM TO STRETCH A STEADYING HAND TO ANOTHER HIS MOTHER WAS FAILING FAST
8630-305212-0010 THE END COULD NOT BE FAR OFF MONICA WAS DEVOTING HERSELF HEART AND SOUL TO THE OLD WOMAN WHO CLUNG TO HER WITH TENDER AFFECTION AND WAS NEVER HAPPY IN HER ABSENCE PATRICIUS WATCHED THEM TOGETHER
8630-305212-0011 AND MARVELLED AT THE EFFECTS OF THE GRACE OF BAPTISM WAS THAT INDEED HIS MOTHER HE ASKED HIMSELF THAT GENTLE PATIENT OLD WOMAN SO THOUGHTFUL FOR OTHERS SO READY TO GIVE UP HER OWN WILL
8630-305212-0012 SHE HAD USED TO BE VIOLENT AND HEADSTRONG LIKE HIMSELF RESENTFUL AND IMPLACABLE IN HER DISLIKES BUT NOW SHE WAS MORE LIKE MONICA THAN LIKE HIM THAT WAS MONICA'S WAY THOUGH HER SWEETNESS AND PATIENCE
8630-305212-0013 SEEMED TO BE CATCHING SHE WAS LIKE THE SUNSHINE PENETRATING EVERYWHERE WITH ITS LIGHT AND WARMTH HE ALAS WAS FAR BEHIND HIS MOTHER CATECHUMEN THOUGH HE WAS THE OLD TEMPER WOULD OFTEN FLASH OUT STILL
8630-305212-0014 SELF CONQUEST WAS THE HARDEST TASK THAT HE HAD EVER UNDERTAKEN AND SOMETIMES HE ALMOST LOST HEART AND WAS INCLINED TO GIVE IT UP ALTOGETHER THEN MONICA WOULD GENTLY REMIND HIM
8630-305212-0015 THAT WITH GOD'S HELP THE HARDEST THINGS WERE POSSIBLE AND THEY WOULD KNEEL AND PRAY TOGETHER AND PATRICIUS WOULD TAKE HEART AGAIN FOR THE FIGHT SHE HAD A WONDERFUL GIFT FOR GIVING PEOPLE COURAGE PATRICIUS HAD NOTICED THAT BEFORE
8630-305212-0016 HE SUPPOSED IT WAS BECAUSE SHE WAS SO FULL OF SYMPATHY AND ALWAYS MADE ALLOWANCES AND THEN SHE SEEMED TO THINK TO BE SURE EVEN THAT IF ONE WENT ON TRYING FAILURES DID NOT MATTER
8630-305212-0017 GOD DID NOT MIND THEM AND THAT WAS A VERY COMFORTING REFLECTION FOR POOR WEAK PEOPLE LIKE HIMSELF TO GO ON TRYING WAS POSSIBLE EVEN FOR HIM ALTHOUGH HE KNEW HE COULD NOT ALWAYS PROMISE HIMSELF SUCCESS
8630-305212-0018 PATRICIUS WAS ANXIOUS ABOUT AUGUSTINE'S FUTURE ALL HIS EFFORTS HAD NOT SUCCEEDED IN SAVING THE SUM REQUIRED FOR HIS FIRST YEAR AT CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0019 HE HAD DISCOVERED THAT IT WOULD COST A GOOD DEAL MORE THAN HE HAD AT FIRST SUPPOSED AND IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHERE THE MONEY WAS TO COME FROM IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT ROMANIANUS
8630-305212-0020 WHO KNEW THE POVERTY OF HIS FRIEND CAME FORWARD GENEROUSLY AND PUT HIS PURSE AT PATRICIUS'S DISPOSAL THE SUM REQUIRED WAS OFFERED WITH SUCH DELICACY THAT IT COULD NOT BE DECLINED AUGUSTINE WAS SURE TO BRING GLORY ON HIS NATIVE TOWN
8630-305212-0021 SAID ROMANIANUS IT WAS AN HONOUR TO BE ALLOWED TO HELP IN HIS EDUCATION MONICA WAS ALMOST GLAD TO SEE HER SON DEPART THE OLD BOYISH LAZINESS HAD GIVEN WAY
8630-305212-0022 TO A REAL ZEAL FOR LEARNING AND THIRST AFTER KNOWLEDGE THE IDLE LIFE AT HOME WAS CERTAINLY THE WORST THING FOR HIM HARD WORK AND THE PURSUIT OF WISDOM MIGHT STEADY HIS WILD NATURE AND BRING HIM BACK TO GOD
8630-305212-0023 IT WAS HER ONLY HOPE NOW AS WITH PRAYERS AND TEARS SHE BESOUGHT OF HIM TO WATCH OVER HER SON BUT MONICA DID NOT KNOW CARTHAGE
8630-305212-0024 IF IT WAS SECOND ONLY TO ROME FOR ITS CULTURE AND ITS SCHOOLS IT ALMOST RIVALLED ROME IN ITS CORRUPTION THERE ALL THAT WAS WORST IN THE CIVILIZATION OF THE EAST AND OF THE WEST MET AND MINGLED
8630-305212-0025 THE BLOODY COMBATS BETWEEN MEN AND BEASTS THE GLADIATORIAL SHOWS THAT DELIGHTED THE ROMANS WERE FREE TO ALL WHO CHOSE TO FREQUENT THE AMPHITHEATRE OF CARTHAGE SUCH PLAYS AS THE ROMANS DELIGHTED IN
8630-305212-0026 IMPOSSIBLE TO DESCRIBE WERE ACTED IN THE THEATRE THE HORRIBLE RITES OF THE EASTERN RELIGIONS WERE PRACTISED OPENLY THERE WAS NEITHER DISCIPLINE NOR ORDER IN THE SCHOOLS
8630-305212-0027 THE WEALTHIER STUDENTS GLORIED IN THEIR BAD REPUTATION THEY WERE YOUNG MEN OF FASHION WHO WERE CAPABLE OF ANYTHING AND WHO WERE CAREFUL TO LET OTHERS KNOW IT THEY WENT BY THE NAME OF SMASHERS OR UPSETTERS
8630-305212-0028 FROM THEIR HABIT OF RAIDING THE SCHOOLS OF PROFESSORS WHOSE TEACHING THEY DID NOT APPROVE AND BREAKING EVERYTHING ON WHICH THEY COULD LAY HANDS THEY TREATED NEW COMERS WITH COARSE BRUTALITY BUT AUGUSTINE SEEMS IN SOME MANNER
8630-305212-0029 TO HAVE ESCAPED THEIR ENMITY PERHAPS A CERTAIN DIGNITY IN THE YOUNG MAN'S BEARING OR PERHAPS HIS BRILLIANT GIFTS WON THEIR RESPECT FOR HE SURPASSED THEM ALL IN INTELLIGENCE AND SPEEDILY OUTSTRIPPED THEM IN CLASS
8630-305212-0030 AUGUSTINE WAS EAGER FOR KNOWLEDGE AND EAGER FOR ENJOYMENT HE FREQUENTED THE THEATRE HIS PLEASURE LOVING NATURE SNATCHED AT EVERYTHING THAT LIFE COULD GIVE YET HE WAS NOT HAPPY
8630-305212-0031 MY GOD HE CRIED IN LATER YEARS WITH WHAT BITTER GALL DIDST THOU IN THY GREAT MERCY SPRINKLE THOSE PLEASURES OF MINE HE COULD NOT FORGET
8630-305212-0032 PATRICIUS PRAYED WITH HER HE UNDERSTOOD AT LAST EVERY DAY THE GERMS OF A NOBLE NATURE THAT HAD LAIN SO LONG DORMANT WITHIN HIM WERE GAINING STRENGTH AND LIFE
8630-305212-0033 EVERY DAY HIS SOUL WAS OPENING MORE AND MORE TO THE UNDERSTANDING OF SPIRITUAL THINGS WHILE MONICA WATCHED THE TRANSFORMATION WITH A HEART THAT OVERFLOWED WITH GRATITUDE AND LOVE
8630-305212-0034 THE SORROWS OF THE PAST WERE ALL FORGOTTEN IN THE JOY OF THE PRESENT THAT HAPPY UNION AT THE FEET OF CHRIST THERE WAS BUT ONE CAUSE FOR SADNESS PATRICIUS'S HEALTH WAS FAILING
8630-305212-0035 HIS MOTHER HAD ALREADY SHOWN HIM THE JOYS OF A CHRISTIAN DEATHBED SHE HAD PASSED AWAY SMILING WITH THEIR HANDS IN HERS AND THE NAME OF JESUS ON HER LIPS
8630-305212-0036 THE BEAUTIFUL PRAYERS OF THE CHURCH HAD GONE DOWN WITH THE DEPARTING SOUL TO THE THRESHOLD OF THE NEW LIFE AND HAD FOLLOWED IT INTO ETERNITY SHE SEEMED CLOSE TO THEM STILL IN THE LIGHT OF THAT WONDERFUL NEW FAITH
8630-305212-0037 AND TO BE WAITING FOR THEM IN THEIR EVERLASTING HOME BUT MONICA'S HAPPINESS WAS TO BE SHORT LIVED FOR IT SEEMED THAT PATRICIUS WOULD SOON REJOIN HIS MOTHER
8630-305212-0038 HE DID NOT DECEIVE HIMSELF HE SPOKE OF HIS APPROACHING DEATH TO MONICA AND ASKED HER TO HELP HIM TO MAKE A WORTHY PREPARATION FOR BAPTISM WHICH HE DESIRED TO RECEIVE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE
8630-305212-0039 WITH THE SIMPLICITY AND TRUSTFULNESS OF A CHILD HE LOOKED TO HER FOR GUIDANCE AND DID ALL THAT SHE DESIRED THE CEREMONY OVER HE TURNED TO HIS WIFE AND SMILED
8630-305212-0040 A WONDERFUL PEACE POSSESSED HIM THE OLD LIFE WITH ALL ITS STAINS HAD PASSED FROM HIM IN THOSE CLEANSING WATERS THE NEW LIFE WAS AT HAND ONCE MORE HE ASKED HER
8630-305212-0041 TO FORGIVE HIM ALL THE PAIN HE HAD CAUSED HER ALL THAT HE HAD MADE HER SUFFER NO SHE MUST NOT GRIEVE HE TOLD HER THE PARTING WOULD BE BUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE THE MEETING FOR ALL ETERNITY
8630-305212-0042 SHE HAD BEEN HIS ANGEL HE SAID HE OWED ALL HIS JOY TO HER IT WAS HER LOVE HER PATIENCE THAT HAD DONE IT ALL SHE HAD SHOWN HIM THE BEAUTY OF GOODNESS AND MADE HIM LOVE IT
8630-305212-0043 HE THANKED HER FOR ALL THAT SHE HAD BEEN TO HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD SHOWN HIM ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE FOR HIM HER TEARS FELL ON HIS FACE HER LOVING ARMS SUPPORTED HIM HER SWEET VOICE BROKEN WITH WEEPING
8630-305212-0044 SPOKE WORDS OF HOPE AND COMFORT ON THE THRESHOLD OF THAT OTHER WORLD MONICA BADE FAREWELL TO HER HUSBAND
8630-305213-0000 CHAPTER SIX HOW SAINT MONICA LIVED IN THE DAYS OF HER WIDOWHOOD AND HOW SHE PUT ALL HER TRUST IN GOD PATRICIUS HAD NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WORLDLY GOODS TO LEAVE TO HIS WIFE
8630-305213-0001 SHE NEEDED LITTLE IT IS TRUE FOR HERSELF BUT THERE WAS AUGUSTINE WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR HER EVEN IF SHE PRACTISED THE STRICTEST ECONOMY TO KEEP HIM AT CARTHAGE WHERE HE WAS DOING SO WELL
8630-305213-0002 ROMANIANUS DIVINED HER ANXIETY AND HASTENED TO SET IT AT REST HE HAD A HOUSE IN CARTHAGE HE SAID IT SHOULD BE AUGUSTINE'S AS LONG AS HE REQUIRED IT
8630-305213-0003 THIS WOULD SETTLE THE QUESTION OF LODGING FOR THE REST CONTINUED ROMANIANUS AS AN OLD FRIEND OF PATRICIUS HE HAD THE RIGHT TO BEFRIEND HIS SON AND MONICA MUST GRANT HIM THE PRIVILEGE
8630-305213-0004 OF ACTING A FATHER'S PART TO AUGUSTINE UNTIL HE WAS FAIRLY LAUNCHED IN LIFE HE HAD A CHILD OF HIS OWN
8630-305213-0005 IF MONICA WOULD BEFRIEND HIS BOY THEY WOULD BE QUITS THE GRATITUDE OF BOTH MOTHER AND SON TOWARDS THIS GENEROUS FRIEND AND BENEFACTOR LASTED THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES
8630-305213-0006 YOU IT WAS ROMANIANUS WROTE AUGUSTINE IN HIS CONFESSIONS WHO WHEN I WAS A POOR YOUNG STUDENT IN CARTHAGE OPENED TO ME YOUR HOUSE YOUR PURSE AND STILL MORE YOUR HEART
8630-305213-0007 YOU IT WAS WHO WHEN I HAD THE SORROW TO LOSE MY FATHER COMFORTED ME BY YOUR FRIENDSHIP HELPED ME WITH YOUR ADVICE AND ASSISTED ME WITH YOUR FORTUNE
8630-305213-0008 MONICA MOURNED HER HUSBAND'S DEATH WITH TRUE DEVOTION BUT HERS WAS NOT A SELFISH SORROW SHE HAD LOVE AND SYMPATHY FOR ALL WHO NEEDED THEM
8630-305213-0009 AND FORGOT HER OWN GRIEF IN SOLACING THAT OF OTHERS THERE WERE CERTAIN GOOD WORKS WHICH THE CHURCH GAVE TO CHRISTIAN WIDOWS TO PERFORM THE HOSPITALS FOR INSTANCE WERE ENTIRELY IN THEIR HANDS
8630-305213-0010 THEY WERE SMALL AS YET BUILT ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF THE MOMENT FROM THE FUNDS OF THE FAITHFUL AND HELD BUT FEW PATIENTS THESE DEVOTED WOMEN SUCCEEDED EACH OTHER AT INTERVALS
8630-305213-0011 IN THEIR TASK OF WASHING AND ATTENDING TO THE SICK WATCHING BY THEIR BEDS AND CLEANING THEIR ROOMS THEIR MINISTRATIONS DID NOT EVEN CEASE THERE WITH REVERENT CARE THEY PREPARED THE DEAD FOR BURIAL
8630-305213-0012 THINKING THE WHILE OF THE PREPARATION OF CHRIST'S BODY FOR THE TOMB AND OF HIM WHO SAID INASMUCH AS YE DO IT TO THE LEAST OF MY BRETHREN YE DO IT UNTO ME
8630-305213-0013 IT WAS A HAPPY MOMENT FOR MONICA WHEN HER TURN CAME TO SERVE THE SICK SHE WOULD KISS THEIR SORES FOR VERY PITY AS SHE WASHED AND DRESSED THEM AND THEIR FACES GREW BRIGHT AT HER COMING
8630-305213-0014 THEY CALLED HER MOTHER IT SEEMED SUCH A NATURAL NAME TO GIVE HER FOR SHE WAS A MOTHER TO THEM ALL AND GAVE THEM A MOTHER'S LOVE TO SOME OF THE POOR CREATURES FRIENDLESS SLAVES AS THEY OFTEN WERE
8630-305213-0015 WHO HAD KNOWN LITTLE SYMPATHY OR TENDERNESS IN THEIR HARD LIVES IT WAS A REVELATION OF CHRISTIANITY WHICH TAUGHT THEM MORE THAN HOURS OF PREACHING COULD HAVE DONE BUT THERE WAS OTHER WORK BESIDES THAT AT THE HOSPITAL
8630-305213-0016 THERE WERE THE POOR TO BE HELPED THE HUNGRY TO BE FED THE NAKED TO BE CLOTHED SHE WOULD GATHER THE ORPHAN CHILDREN AT HER KNEE TO TEACH THEM THE TRUTHS OF THEIR FAITH WHEN THEY WERE VERY POOR
8630-305213-0017 SHE WOULD KEEP THEM IN HER OWN HOUSE FEED THEM AT HER OWN TABLE AND CLOTHE THEM WITH HER OWN HANDS IF I AM A MOTHER TO THESE MOTHERLESS ONES SHE WOULD SAY TO HERSELF HE WILL HAVE MERCY AND GIVE ME BACK MY BOY
8630-305213-0018 IF I TEACH THEM TO KNOW AND LOVE HIM AS A FATHER HE WILL WATCH OVER MY SON IT WAS A CUSTOM OF THE TIME ON THE FEASTS OF SAINTS AND MARTYRS TO MAKE A PILGRIMAGE TO THEIR TOMBS
8630-305213-0019 WITH A LITTLE BASKET OF FOOD AND WINE THIS WAS LAID ON THE GRAVE AFTER WHICH THE FAITHFUL WOULD PARTAKE OF WHAT THEY HAD BROUGHT WHILE THEY THOUGHT AND SPOKE OF THE NOBLE LIVES OF GOD'S SERVANTS WHO HAD GONE BEFORE
8630-305213-0020 THE CUSTOM WAS ABOLISHED NOT LONG AFTER ON ACCOUNT OF THE ABUSES WHICH HAD ARISEN BUT MONICA OBSERVED IT TO THE END SHE SCARCELY TASTED OF HER OFFERING HERSELF
8630-305213-0021 BUT GAVE IT ALL AWAY TO THE POOR OFTEN INDEED SHE WENT COLD AND HUNGRY THAT THEY MIGHT BE CLOTHED AND FED HER LOVE OF PRAYER TOO COULD NOW FIND FULL SCOPE
8630-305213-0022 EVERY MORNING FOUND HER IN HER PLACE IN CHURCH FOR THE HOLY SACRIFICE EVERY EVENING SHE WAS THERE AGAIN SILENT ABSORBED IN GOD THE PLACE WHERE SHE KNELT WAS OFTEN WET WITH HER TEARS
8630-305213-0023 THE TIME PASSED BY UNHEEDED PATRICIUS HER HUSBAND WAS SAFE IN GOD'S HANDS BUT AUGUSTINE HER ELDEST BORN HER DARLING IN WHAT DARK PATHS WAS HE WANDERING
8630-305213-0024 AND YET IN HER HEART OF HEARTS THERE WAS A DEEP CONVICTION THAT NO SAD NEWS OF HIS LIFE AT CARTHAGE COULD SHAKE HIS WAS NOT THE NATURE TO FIND CONTENTMENT IN THE THINGS OF EARTH
8630-305213-0025 HE WAS BORN TO SOMETHING HIGHER HIS NOBLE HEART HIS STRONG INTELLIGENCE WOULD BRING HIM BACK TO GOD AND YET AND YET
8630-305213-0026 HER HEART SANK AS SHE THOUGHT OF GRACES WASTED OF CONSCIENCE TRAMPLED UNDERFOOT OF LIGHT REJECTED NO THERE WAS NO HOPE ANYWHERE BUT WITH GOD IN HIM SHE WOULD TRUST AND IN HIM ALONE
8630-305213-0027 HE WAS INFINITE IN MERCY AND STRONG TO SAVE HE HAD PROMISED THAT HE WOULD NEVER FAIL THOSE WHO PUT THEIR TRUST IN HIM AT HIS FEET AND AT HIS FEET ALONE
8630-305213-0028 MONICA POURED OUT HER TEARS AND HER SORROW WITH OTHERS SHE WAS SERENE AND HOPEFUL AS OF OLD EVEN JOYOUS ALWAYS READY TO HELP AND COMFORT IT WAS SAID OF HER AFTER HER DEATH
8630-305213-0029 THAT NO ONE HAD SUCH A GIFT OF HELPING OTHERS AS SHE SHE NEVER PREACHED AT PEOPLE MOST PEOPLE HAVE AN INSURMOUNTABLE DISLIKE TO BEING PREACHED AT BUT EVERY WORD SHE SAID HAD A STRANGE POWER OF DRAWING SOULS TO GOD
8630-305213-0030 OF MAKING THEM WISH TO BE BETTER AUGUSTINE MEANWHILE AT CARTHAGE WAS JUSTIFYING ALL THE HOPES THAT HAD BEEN FORMED OF HIM HE HAD EVEN GREATER GIFTS IT SEEMED THAN ELOQUENCE FEELING AND WIT
8630-305213-0031 HE WAS AT THE HEAD OF HIS CLASS IN RHETORIC HIS MASTER HAD SPOKEN TO HIM OF A CERTAIN TREATISE OF ARISTOTLE WHICH HE WOULD SOON BE CALLED UPON TO STUDY IT WAS SO PROFOUND HE SAID THAT FEW COULD UNDERSTAND IT
8630-305213-0032 EVEN WITH THE HELP OF THE MOST LEARNED PROFESSORS AUGUSTINE EAGER TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THIS WONDERFUL WORK PROCURED IT AT ONCE AND READ IT IT SEEMED TO HIM PERFECTLY SIMPLE IT WAS UNNECESSARY HE FOUND
8630-305213-0033 TO ASK A SINGLE EXPLANATION IT WAS THE SAME WITH GEOMETRY MUSIC EVERY SCIENCE HE TOOK UP THIS YOUNG GENIUS OF NINETEEN ONLY DISCOVERED THERE WERE DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY
8630-305213-0034 WHEN HE HAD TO TEACH OTHERS AND REALIZED HOW HARD IT WAS TO MAKE THEM UNDERSTAND WHAT WAS SO EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE TO HIMSELF THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGELY SYMPATHETIC AND ATTRACTIVE ABOUT AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0035 HE SEEMED MODEST AND RESERVED ABOUT HIS OWN GIFTS ALTHOUGH HE HIMSELF TELLS US IN HIS CONFESSIONS THAT HE WAS FULL OF PRIDE AND AMBITION HE HAD A GIFT OF MAKING TRUE AND FAITHFUL FRIENDS A CHARM IN CONVERSATION
8630-305213-0036 THAT DREW HIS YOUNG COMPANIONS AND EVEN OLDER MEN TO HIS SIDE A MORE WORLDLY MOTHER THAN MONICA WOULD HAVE BEEN THOROUGHLY PROUD OF HER SON FAITH AND VIRTUE WERE ALONE WEAK AND FAINT IN THAT SOUL
8630-305213-0037 THAT COULD SO ILL DO WITHOUT THEM BUT TO HER THEY WERE THE ONE ESSENTIAL THING THE REST DID NOT MATTER YET MONICA WITH TRUE INSIGHT BELIEVED THAT WITH NOBLE MINDS KNOWLEDGE MUST DRAW MEN TO GOD
8630-305213-0038 SHE HOPED MUCH THEREFORE THAT AUGUSTINE'S BRILLIANCE OF INTELLECT WOULD SAVE HIM IN THE END AND HER HOPES WERE NOT DECEIVED ALREADY THE NOBLE PHILOSOPHY OF CICERO
8630-305213-0039 PAGAN THOUGH HE WAS HAD AWAKENED A THIRST FOR WISDOM IN THE YOUNG STUDENT'S SOUL ALREADY HE FELT THE EMPTINESS OF EARTHLY JOYS I LONGED MY GOD HE WRITES
8630-305213-0040 AND I KNEW NOT THAT IT WAS THOU THAT WAST WORKING IN ME ONE THING COOLED MY ARDOUR HE GOES ON TO SAY IT WAS THAT THE NAME OF CHRIST WAS NOT THERE AND THIS NAME BY THY MERCY LORD
8630-305213-0041 OF THY SON MY SAVIOUR MY HEART HAD DRAWN IN WITH MY MOTHER'S MILK AND KEPT IN ITS DEPTHS AND EVERY DOCTRINE WHERE THIS NAME DID NOT APPEAR FLUENT ELEGANT AND TRUTH LIKE THOUGH IT MIGHT BE
8630-305213-0042 COULD NOT MASTER ME ALTOGETHER HE THEN TURNED TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES BUT THEY APPEARED TO HIM INFERIOR IN STYLE TO CICERO MY PRIDE HE WRITES
8630-305213-0043 DESPISED THE MANNER IN WHICH THE THINGS ARE SAID AND MY INTELLIGENCE COULD NOT DISCOVER THE HIDDEN SENSE
8630-305213-0044 AND I DISDAINED TO HUMBLE MYSELF AND INFLATED WITH VAINGLORY I BELIEVED MYSELF GREAT IT WAS AT THIS MOMENT THAT HE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE MANICHEANS WHOSE ERRORS ATTRACTED HIM AT ONCE
8630-305213-0045 THIS EXTRAORDINARY HERESY HAD BEGUN IN THE EAST AND HAD SPREAD ALL OVER THE CIVILIZED WORLD ITS FOLLOWERS FORMED A SECRET SOCIETY WITH SIGNS AND PASSWORDS GRADES AND INITIATIONS
8630-305213-0046 TO IMPOSE ON CHRISTIANS THEY USED CHRISTIAN WORDS FOR DOCTRINES THAT WERE THOROUGHLY UNCHRISTIAN PERHAPS THE MOST REMARKABLE THING ABOUT THEM WAS THEIR HATRED OF THE CHURCH AUGUSTINE
8630-305213-0047 WHO REMAINED AMONGST THEM FOR NINE YEARS THUS DESCRIBES THEM WHEN WRITING TO A FRIEND THOU KNOWEST HONORATUS THAT FOR THIS REASON ALONE DID WE FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THESE MEN
8630-305213-0048 NAMELY THAT THEY PROFESSED TO FREE US FROM ALL ERRORS AND BRING US TO GOD BY PURE REASON ALONE WITHOUT THAT TERRIBLE PRINCIPLE OF AUTHORITY FOR WHAT ELSE INDUCED ME TO ABANDON THE FAITH OF MY CHILDHOOD
8630-305213-0049 AND FOLLOW THESE MEN FOR ALMOST NINE YEARS BUT THEIR ASSERTION THAT WE WERE TERRIFIED BY SUPERSTITION INTO A FAITH BLINDLY IMPOSED UPON OUR REASON WHILE THEY URGED NO ONE TO BELIEVE
8630-305213-0050 UNTIL THE TRUTH WAS FULLY DISCUSSED AND PROVED WHO WOULD NOT BE SEDUCED BY SUCH PROMISES ESPECIALLY IF HE WERE A PROUD CONTENTIOUS YOUNG MAN THIRSTING FOR TRUTH SUCH AS THEY THEN FOUND ME
8630-305213-0051 THAT WAS WHAT THE MANICHEANS PROMISED WHAT AUGUSTINE FOUND AMONGST THEM HE ALSO TELLS US THEY INCESSANTLY REPEATED TO ME TRUTH TRUTH BUT THERE WAS NO TRUTH IN THEM
8630-305213-0052 THEY TAUGHT WHAT WAS FALSE NOT ONLY ABOUT THEE MY GOD WHO ART THE VERY TRUTH BUT EVEN ABOUT THE ELEMENTS OF THIS WORLD THY CREATURES SO MUCH FOR THEIR DOCTRINES AS FOR THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES
8630-305213-0053 HE FOUND THEM CARNAL AND LOQUACIOUS FULL OF INSANE PRIDE THE GREAT CHARM OF MANICHEISM TO AUGUSTINE WAS THAT IT TAUGHT THAT A MAN WAS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR HIS SINS THIS DOCTRINE WAS CONVENIENT TO ONE
8630-305213-0054 WHO COULD NOT FIND THE STRENGTH TO BREAK WITH HIS BAD HABITS SUCH WAS MY MIND HE SUMS UP LATER LOOKING BACK ON THIS PERIOD OF HIS LIFE SO WEIGHED DOWN SO BLINDED BY THE FLESH
87-121553-0000 AND IN ITS GYRE HAD NOT TURNED WHOLLY ROUND BEFORE ANOTHER IN A RING ENCLOSED IT AND MOTION JOINED TO MOTION SONG TO SONG SONG THAT AS GREATLY DOTH TRANSCEND OUR MUSES OUR SIRENS IN THOSE DULCET CLARIONS AS PRIMAL SPLENDOUR THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED
87-121553-0001 WHEN JUNO TO HER HANDMAID GIVES COMMAND THE ONE WITHOUT BORN OF THE ONE WITHIN LIKE TO THE SPEAKING OF THAT VAGRANT ONE WHOM LOVE CONSUMED AS DOTH THE SUN THE VAPOURS
87-121553-0002 AFTER THE DANCE AND OTHER GRAND REJOICINGS BOTH OF THE SINGING AND THE FLAMING FORTH EFFULGENCE WITH EFFULGENCE BLITHE AND TENDER TOGETHER AT ONCE WITH ONE ACCORD HAD STOPPED EVEN AS THE EYES THAT AS VOLITION MOVES THEM MUST NEEDS TOGETHER SHUT AND LIFT THEMSELVES
87-121553-0003 OUT OF THE HEART OF ONE OF THE NEW LIGHTS THERE CAME A VOICE THAT NEEDLE TO THE STAR MADE ME APPEAR IN TURNING THITHERWARD AND IT BEGAN THE LOVE THAT MAKES ME FAIR DRAWS ME TO SPEAK ABOUT THE OTHER LEADER BY WHOM SO WELL IS SPOKEN HERE OF MINE
87-121553-0004 TIS RIGHT WHERE ONE IS TO BRING IN THE OTHER THAT AS THEY WERE UNITED IN THEIR WARFARE TOGETHER LIKEWISE MAY THEIR GLORY SHINE THE SOLDIERY OF CHRIST WHICH IT HAD COST SO DEAR TO ARM AGAIN BEHIND THE STANDARD MOVED SLOW AND DOUBTFUL AND IN NUMBERS FEW
87-121553-0005 WHEN THE EMPEROR WHO REIGNETH EVERMORE PROVIDED FOR THE HOST THAT WAS IN PERIL THROUGH GRACE ALONE AND NOT THAT IT WAS WORTHY AND AS WAS SAID HE TO HIS BRIDE BROUGHT SUCCOUR WITH CHAMPIONS TWAIN AT WHOSE DEED AT WHOSE WORD THE STRAGGLING PEOPLE WERE TOGETHER DRAWN
87-121553-0006 WITHIN THAT REGION WHERE THE SWEET WEST WIND RISES TO OPEN THE NEW LEAVES WHEREWITH EUROPE IS SEEN TO CLOTHE HERSELF AFRESH NOT FAR OFF FROM THE BEATING OF THE WAVES BEHIND WHICH IN HIS LONG CAREER THE SUN SOMETIMES CONCEALS HIMSELF FROM EVERY MAN
87-121553-0007 IS SITUATE THE FORTUNATE CALAHORRA UNDER PROTECTION OF THE MIGHTY SHIELD IN WHICH THE LION SUBJECT IS AND SOVEREIGN THEREIN WAS BORN THE AMOROUS PARAMOUR OF CHRISTIAN FAITH THE ATHLETE CONSECRATE KIND TO HIS OWN AND CRUEL TO HIS FOES
87-121553-0008 AND WHEN IT WAS CREATED WAS HIS MIND REPLETE WITH SUCH A LIVING ENERGY THAT IN HIS MOTHER HER IT MADE PROPHETIC AS SOON AS THE ESPOUSALS WERE COMPLETE BETWEEN HIM AND THE FAITH AT HOLY FONT WHERE THEY WITH MUTUAL SAFETY DOWERED EACH OTHER
87-121553-0009 THE WOMAN WHO FOR HIM HAD GIVEN ASSENT SAW IN A DREAM THE ADMIRABLE FRUIT THAT ISSUE WOULD FROM HIM AND FROM HIS HEIRS AND THAT HE MIGHT BE CONSTRUED AS HE WAS A SPIRIT FROM THIS PLACE WENT FORTH TO NAME HIM WITH HIS POSSESSIVE WHOSE HE WHOLLY WAS
87-121553-0010 DOMINIC WAS HE CALLED AND HIM I SPEAK OF EVEN AS OF THE HUSBANDMAN WHOM CHRIST ELECTED TO HIS GARDEN TO ASSIST HIM ENVOY AND SERVANT SOOTH HE SEEMED OF CHRIST FOR THE FIRST LOVE MADE MANIFEST IN HIM WAS THE FIRST COUNSEL THAT WAS GIVEN BY CHRIST
87-121553-0011 SILENT AND WAKEFUL MANY A TIME WAS HE DISCOVERED BY HIS NURSE UPON THE GROUND AS IF HE WOULD HAVE SAID FOR THIS I CAME O THOU HIS FATHER FELIX VERILY O THOU HIS MOTHER VERILY JOANNA IF THIS INTERPRETED MEANS AS IS SAID
87-121553-0012 NOT FOR THE WORLD WHICH PEOPLE TOIL FOR NOW IN FOLLOWING OSTIENSE AND TADDEO BUT THROUGH HIS LONGING AFTER THE TRUE MANNA HE IN SHORT TIME BECAME SO GREAT A TEACHER THAT HE BEGAN TO GO ABOUT THE VINEYARD WHICH FADETH SOON IF FAITHLESS BE THE DRESSER
87-121553-0013 NOT THROUGH ITSELF BUT HIM WHO SITS THERE AND DEGENERATES NOT TO DISPENSE OR TWO OR THREE FOR SIX NOT ANY FORTUNE OF FIRST VACANCY NON DECIMAS QUAE SUNT PAUPERUM DEI
87-121553-0014 HE ASKED FOR BUT AGAINST THE ERRANT WORLD PERMISSION TO DO BATTLE FOR THE SEED OF WHICH THESE FOUR AND TWENTY PLANTS SURROUND THEE THEN WITH THE DOCTRINE AND THE WILL TOGETHER WITH OFFICE APOSTOLICAL HE MOVED LIKE TORRENT WHICH SOME LOFTY VEIN OUT PRESSES
87-121553-0015 AND IN AMONG THE SHOOTS HERETICAL HIS IMPETUS WITH GREATER FURY SMOTE WHEREVER THE RESISTANCE WAS THE GREATEST OF HIM WERE MADE THEREAFTER DIVERS RUNNELS WHEREBY THE GARDEN CATHOLIC IS WATERED SO THAT MORE LIVING ITS PLANTATIONS STAND
87-121553-0016 IN WHICH THE HOLY CHURCH ITSELF DEFENDED AND IN THE FIELD ITS CIVIC BATTLE WON TRULY FULL MANIFEST SHOULD BE TO THEE THE EXCELLENCE OF THE OTHER UNTO WHOM THOMAS SO COURTEOUS WAS BEFORE MY COMING
87-121553-0017 BUT STILL THE ORBIT WHICH THE HIGHEST PART OF ITS CIRCUMFERENCE MADE IS DERELICT SO THAT THE MOULD IS WHERE WAS ONCE THE CRUST HIS FAMILY THAT HAD STRAIGHT FORWARD MOVED WITH FEET UPON HIS FOOTPRINTS ARE TURNED ROUND SO THAT THEY SET THE POINT UPON THE HEEL
87-121553-0018 I AM AS I AM WONT TWILL NOT BE FROM CASAL NOR ACQUASPARTA FROM WHENCE COME SUCH UNTO THE WRITTEN WORD THAT ONE AVOIDS IT AND THE OTHER NARROWS
87-121553-0019 WHO ALWAYS IN GREAT OFFICES POSTPONED CONSIDERATIONS SINISTER HERE ARE ILLUMINATO AND AGOSTINO WHO OF THE FIRST BAREFOOTED BEGGARS WERE THAT WITH THE CORD THE FRIENDS OF GOD BECAME HUGH OF SAINT VICTOR IS AMONG THEM HERE
87-121553-0020 AND PETER MANGIADOR AND PETER OF SPAIN WHO DOWN BELOW IN VOLUMES TWELVE IS SHINING NATHAN THE SEER AND METROPOLITAN CHRYSOSTOM
87-121553-0021 HERE IS RABANUS AND BESIDE ME HERE SHINES THE CALABRIAN ABBOT JOACHIM HE WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROPHECY ENDOWED TO CELEBRATE SO GREAT A PALADIN HAVE MOVED ME THE IMPASSIONED COURTESY AND THE DISCREET DISCOURSES OF FRIAR THOMAS
87-121553-0022 LET HIM IMAGINE WHO WOULD WELL CONCEIVE WHAT NOW I SAW AND LET HIM WHILE I SPEAK RETAIN THE IMAGE AS A STEADFAST ROCK THE FIFTEEN STARS THAT IN THEIR DIVERS REGIONS THE SKY ENLIVEN WITH A LIGHT SO GREAT
87-121553-0023 THAT IN THE POINT BEGINNETH OF THE AXIS ROUND ABOUT WHICH THE PRIMAL WHEEL REVOLVES TO HAVE FASHIONED OF THEMSELVES TWO SIGNS IN HEAVEN
87-121553-0024 THE MOMENT WHEN SHE FELT THE FROST OF DEATH AND ONE TO HAVE ITS RAYS WITHIN THE OTHER AND BOTH TO WHIRL THEMSELVES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT ONE SHOULD FORWARD GO THE OTHER BACKWARD
87-121553-0025 AND HE WILL HAVE SOME SHADOWING FORTH OF THAT TRUE CONSTELLATION AND THE DOUBLE DANCE THAT CIRCLED ROUND THE POINT AT WHICH I WAS BECAUSE IT IS AS MUCH BEYOND OUR WONT AS SWIFTER THAN THE MOTION OF THE CHIANA MOVETH THE HEAVEN THAT ALL THE REST OUTSPEEDS
87-121553-0026 THEN BROKE THE SILENCE OF THOSE SAINTS CONCORDANT THE LIGHT IN WHICH THE ADMIRABLE LIFE OF GOD'S OWN MENDICANT WAS TOLD TO ME AND SAID
87-121553-0027 THAT IT WEIGHS DOWN THE BALANCE OF ALL SIN WHATE'ER OF LIGHT IT HAS TO HUMAN NATURE BEEN LAWFUL TO POSSESS WAS ALL INFUSED BY THE SAME POWER THAT BOTH OF THEM CREATED AND HENCE AT WHAT I SAID ABOVE DOST WONDER
87-121553-0028 WHEN I NARRATED THAT NO SECOND HAD THE GOOD WHICH IN THE FIFTH LIGHT IS ENCLOSED NOW OPE THINE EYES TO WHAT I ANSWER THEE AND THOU SHALT SEE THY CREED AND MY DISCOURSE FIT IN THE TRUTH AS CENTRE IN A CIRCLE THAT WHICH CAN DIE
87-121553-0029 AND THAT WHICH DIETH NOT ARE NOTHING BUT THE SPLENDOUR OF THE IDEA WHICH BY HIS LOVE OUR LORD BRINGS INTO BEING BECAUSE THAT LIVING LIGHT WHICH FROM ITS FOUNT EFFULGENT FLOWS SO THAT IT DISUNITES NOT FROM HIM NOR FROM THE LOVE IN THEM INTRINED
87-121553-0030 ITSELF ETERNALLY REMAINING ONE THENCE IT DESCENDS TO THE LAST POTENCIES DOWNWARD FROM ACT TO ACT BECOMING SUCH THAT ONLY BRIEF CONTINGENCIES IT MAKES AND THESE CONTINGENCIES I HOLD TO BE THINGS GENERATED
87-121553-0031 WHICH THE HEAVEN PRODUCES BY ITS OWN MOTION WITH SEED AND WITHOUT NEITHER THEIR WAX NOR THAT WHICH TEMPERS IT REMAINS IMMUTABLE AND HENCE BENEATH THE IDEAL SIGNET MORE AND LESS SHINES THROUGH THEREFORE IT HAPPENS THAT THE SELFSAME TREE
87-121553-0032 AFTER ITS KIND BEARS WORSE AND BETTER FRUIT AND YE ARE BORN WITH CHARACTERS DIVERSE IF IN PERFECTION TEMPERED WERE THE WAX AND WERE THE HEAVEN IN ITS SUPREMEST VIRTUE THE BRILLIANCE OF THE SEAL WOULD ALL APPEAR BUT NATURE GIVES IT EVERMORE DEFICIENT
87-121553-0033 IN THE LIKE MANNER WORKING AS THE ARTIST WHO HAS THE SKILL OF ART AND HAND THAT TREMBLES IF THEN THE FERVENT LOVE THE VISION CLEAR OF PRIMAL VIRTUE DO DISPOSE AND SEAL PERFECTION ABSOLUTE IS THERE ACQUIRED
87-121553-0034 NOW IF NO FARTHER FORTH I SHOULD PROCEED THEN IN WHAT WAY WAS HE WITHOUT A PEER
87-121553-0035 THINK WHO HE WAS AND WHAT OCCASION MOVED HIM TO MAKE REQUEST WHEN IT WAS TOLD HIM ASK I'VE NOT SO SPOKEN THAT THOU CANST NOT SEE CLEARLY HE WAS A KING WHO ASKED FOR WISDOM THAT HE MIGHT BE SUFFICIENTLY A KING TWAS NOT TO KNOW THE NUMBER IN WHICH ARE THE MOTORS HERE ABOVE
87-121553-0036 OR IF IN SEMICIRCLE CAN BE MADE TRIANGLE SO THAT IT HAVE NO RIGHT ANGLE WHENCE IF THOU NOTEST THIS AND WHAT I SAID A REGAL PRUDENCE IS THAT PEERLESS SEEING IN WHICH THE SHAFT OF MY INTENTION STRIKES AND IF ON ROSE THOU TURNEST THY CLEAR EYES
87-121553-0037 AND THE GOOD ARE RARE WITH THIS DISTINCTION TAKE THOU WHAT I SAID AND THUS IT CAN CONSIST WITH THY BELIEF OF THE FIRST FATHER AND OF OUR DELIGHT AND LEAD SHALL THIS BE ALWAYS TO THY FEET TO MAKE THEE LIKE A WEARY MAN MOVE SLOWLY
87-121553-0038 BOTH TO THE YES AND NO THOU SEEST NOT FOR VERY LOW AMONG THE FOOLS IS HE WHO AFFIRMS WITHOUT DISTINCTION OR DENIES AS WELL IN ONE AS IN THE OTHER CASE BECAUSE IT HAPPENS THAT FULL OFTEN BENDS CURRENT OPINION IN THE FALSE DIRECTION
87-121553-0039 AND THEN THE FEELINGS BIND THE INTELLECT FAR MORE THAN USELESSLY HE LEAVES THE SHORE SINCE HE RETURNETH NOT THE SAME HE WENT WHO FISHES FOR THE TRUTH AND HAS NO SKILL
87-121553-0040 THUS DID SABELLIUS ARIUS AND THOSE FOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN EVEN AS SWORDS UNTO THE SCRIPTURES IN RENDERING DISTORTED THEIR STRAIGHT FACES NOR YET SHALL PEOPLE BE TOO CONFIDENT IN JUDGING EVEN AS HE IS WHO DOTH COUNT THE CORN IN FIELD OR EVER IT BE RIPE
87-121553-0041 FOR I HAVE SEEN ALL WINTER LONG THE THORN FIRST SHOW ITSELF INTRACTABLE AND FIERCE AND AFTER BEAR THE ROSE UPON ITS TOP AND I HAVE SEEN A SHIP DIRECT AND SWIFT RUN O'ER THE SEA THROUGHOUT ITS COURSE ENTIRE TO PERISH AT THE HARBOUR'S MOUTH AT LAST
87-121553-0042 AS FROM WITHOUT TIS STRUCK OR FROM WITHIN INTO MY MIND UPON A SUDDEN DROPPED WHAT I AM SAYING AT THE MOMENT WHEN SILENT BECAME THE GLORIOUS LIFE OF THOMAS BECAUSE OF THE RESEMBLANCE THAT WAS BORN OF HIS DISCOURSE AND THAT OF BEATRICE WHOM AFTER HIM IT PLEASED THUS TO BEGIN
87-121553-0043 THIS MAN HAS NEED AND DOES NOT TELL YOU SO NOR WITH THE VOICE NOR EVEN IN HIS THOUGHT OF GOING TO THE ROOT OF ONE TRUTH MORE DECLARE UNTO HIM IF THE LIGHT WHEREWITH BLOSSOMS YOUR SUBSTANCE SHALL REMAIN WITH YOU ETERNALLY THE SAME THAT IT IS NOW
87-121553-0044 AND IF IT DO REMAIN SAY IN WHAT MANNER AFTER YE ARE AGAIN MADE VISIBLE IT CAN BE THAT IT INJURE NOT YOUR SIGHT AS BY A GREATER GLADNESS URGED AND DRAWN THEY WHO ARE DANCING IN A RING SOMETIMES UPLIFT THEIR VOICES AND THEIR MOTIONS QUICKEN
87-121553-0045 SO AT THAT ORISON DEVOUT AND PROMPT THE HOLY CIRCLES A NEW JOY DISPLAYED IN THEIR REVOLVING AND THEIR WONDROUS SONG WHOSO LAMENTETH HIM THAT HERE WE DIE THAT WE MAY LIVE ABOVE HAS NEVER THERE SEEN THE REFRESHMENT OF THE ETERNAL RAIN
87-121553-0046 THE ONE AND TWO AND THREE WHO EVER LIVETH AND REIGNETH EVER IN THREE AND TWO AND ONE NOT CIRCUMSCRIBED AND ALL THINGS CIRCUMSCRIBING THREE SEVERAL TIMES WAS CHANTED BY EACH ONE AMONG THOSE SPIRITS WITH SUCH MELODY THAT FOR ALL MERIT IT WERE JUST REWARD
87-121553-0047 ITS BRIGHTNESS IS PROPORTIONED TO THE ARDOUR THE ARDOUR TO THE VISION AND THE VISION EQUALS WHAT GRACE IT HAS ABOVE ITS WORTH WHEN GLORIOUS AND SANCTIFIED OUR FLESH IS REASSUMED THEN SHALL OUR PERSONS BE MORE PLEASING BY THEIR BEING ALL COMPLETE
87-121553-0048 FOR WILL INCREASE WHATE'ER BESTOWS ON US OF LIGHT GRATUITOUS THE GOOD SUPREME LIGHT WHICH ENABLES US TO LOOK ON HIM THEREFORE THE VISION MUST PERFORCE INCREASE INCREASE THE ARDOUR WHICH FROM THAT IS KINDLED INCREASE THE RADIANCE WHICH FROM THIS PROCEEDS
87-121553-0049 NOR CAN SO GREAT A SPLENDOUR WEARY US FOR STRONG WILL BE THE ORGANS OF THE BODY TO EVERYTHING WHICH HATH THE POWER TO PLEASE US SO SUDDEN AND ALERT APPEARED TO ME BOTH ONE AND THE OTHER CHOIR TO SAY AMEN THAT WELL THEY SHOWED DESIRE FOR THEIR DEAD BODIES
87-121553-0050 NOR SOLE FOR THEM PERHAPS BUT FOR THE MOTHERS THE FATHERS AND THE REST WHO HAD BEEN DEAR OR EVER THEY BECAME ETERNAL FLAMES AND LO ALL ROUND ABOUT OF EQUAL BRIGHTNESS AROSE A LUSTRE OVER WHAT WAS THERE LIKE AN HORIZON THAT IS CLEARING UP
87-121553-0051 SO THAT THE SIGHT SEEMS REAL AND UNREAL IT SEEMED TO ME THAT NEW SUBSISTENCES BEGAN THERE TO BE SEEN AND MAKE A CIRCLE OUTSIDE THE OTHER TWO CIRCUMFERENCES O VERY SPARKLING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT HOW SUDDEN AND INCANDESCENT IT BECAME UNTO MINE EYES THAT VANQUISHED BORE IT NOT
87-121553-0052 BUT BEATRICE SO BEAUTIFUL AND SMILING APPEARED TO ME THAT WITH THE OTHER SIGHTS THAT FOLLOWED NOT MY MEMORY I MUST LEAVE HER THEN TO UPLIFT THEMSELVES MINE EYES RESUMED THE POWER AND I BEHELD MYSELF TRANSLATED TO HIGHER SALVATION WITH MY LADY ONLY
87-121553-0053 WELL WAS I WARE THAT I WAS MORE UPLIFTED BY THE ENKINDLED SMILING OF THE STAR THAT SEEMED TO ME MORE RUDDY THAN ITS WONT WITH ALL MY HEART AND IN THAT DIALECT WHICH IS THE SAME IN ALL SUCH HOLOCAUST TO GOD I MADE AS THE NEW GRACE BESEEMED
87-121553-0054 AND NOT YET FROM MY BOSOM WAS EXHAUSTED THE ARDOUR OF SACRIFICE BEFORE I KNEW THIS OFFERING WAS ACCEPTED AND AUSPICIOUS FOR WITH SO GREAT A LUSTRE AND SO RED SPLENDOURS APPEARED TO ME IN TWOFOLD RAYS I SAID O HELIOS WHO DOST SO ADORN THEM
87-121553-0055 EVEN AS DISTINCT WITH LESS AND GREATER LIGHTS GLIMMERS BETWEEN THE TWO POLES OF THE WORLD THE GALAXY THAT MAKETH WISE MEN DOUBT THUS CONSTELLATED IN THE DEPTHS OF MARS THOSE RAYS DESCRIBED THE VENERABLE SIGN THAT QUADRANTS JOINING IN A CIRCLE MAKE
87-121553-0056 HERE DOTH MY MEMORY OVERCOME MY GENIUS FOR ON THAT CROSS AS LEVIN GLEAMED FORTH CHRIST SO THAT I CANNOT FIND ENSAMPLE WORTHY BUT HE WHO TAKES HIS CROSS AND FOLLOWS CHRIST AGAIN WILL PARDON ME WHAT I OMIT SEEING IN THAT AURORA LIGHTEN CHRIST
87-121553-0057 SO FROM THE LIGHTS THAT THERE TO ME APPEARED UPGATHERED THROUGH THE CROSS A MELODY WHICH RAPT ME NOT DISTINGUISHING THE HYMN WELL WAS I WARE IT WAS OF LOFTY LAUD BECAUSE THERE CAME TO ME ARISE AND CONQUER AS UNTO HIM WHO HEARS AND COMPREHENDS NOT
87-121553-0058 SO MUCH ENAMOURED I BECAME THEREWITH THAT UNTIL THEN THERE WAS NOT ANYTHING THAT E'ER HAD FETTERED ME WITH SUCH SWEET BONDS PERHAPS MY WORD APPEARS SOMEWHAT TOO BOLD POSTPONING THE DELIGHT OF THOSE FAIR EYES INTO WHICH GAZING MY DESIRE HAS REST
87-121553-0059 BUT WHO BETHINKS HIM THAT THE LIVING SEALS OF EVERY BEAUTY GROW IN POWER ASCENDING AND THAT I THERE HAD NOT TURNED ROUND TO THOSE CAN ME EXCUSE IF I MYSELF ACCUSE TO EXCUSE MYSELF AND SEE THAT I SPEAK TRULY FOR HERE THE HOLY JOY IS NOT DISCLOSED
87-121553-0060 A WILL BENIGN IN WHICH REVEALS ITSELF EVER THE LOVE THAT RIGHTEOUSLY INSPIRES AS IN THE INIQUITOUS CUPIDITY SILENCE IMPOSED UPON THAT DULCET LYRE AND QUIETED THE CONSECRATED CHORDS
87-121553-0061 THAT HEAVEN'S RIGHT HAND DOTH TIGHTEN AND RELAX HOW UNTO JUST ENTREATIES SHALL BE DEAF THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH TO GIVE ME DESIRE OF PRAYING THEM WITH ONE ACCORD GREW SILENT TIS WELL THAT WITHOUT END HE SHOULD LAMENT
87-121553-0062 WHO FOR THE LOVE OF THING THAT DOTH NOT LAST ETERNALLY DESPOILS HIM OF THAT LOVE AS THROUGH THE PURE AND TRANQUIL EVENING AIR THERE SHOOTS FROM TIME TO TIME A SUDDEN FIRE MOVING THE EYES THAT STEADFAST WERE BEFORE
87-121553-0063 AND SEEMS TO BE A STAR THAT CHANGETH PLACE EXCEPT THAT IN THE PART WHERE IT IS KINDLED NOTHING IS MISSED AND THIS ENDURETH LITTLE SO FROM THE HORN THAT TO THE RIGHT EXTENDS UNTO THAT CROSS'S FOOT THERE RAN A STAR OUT OF THE CONSTELLATION SHINING THERE
87-121553-0064 SO THAT FIRE SEEMED IT BEHIND ALABASTER THUS PITEOUS DID ANCHISES SHADE REACH FORWARD IF ANY FAITH OUR GREATEST MUSE DESERVE WHEN IN ELYSIUM HE HIS SON PERCEIVED
87-121553-0065 THEN PLEASANT TO THE HEARING AND THE SIGHT THE SPIRIT JOINED TO ITS BEGINNING THINGS I UNDERSTOOD NOT SO PROFOUND IT SPAKE NOR DID IT HIDE ITSELF FROM ME BY CHOICE BUT BY NECESSITY FOR ITS CONCEPTION ABOVE THE MARK OF MORTALS SET ITSELF
87-121553-0066 AND WHEN THE BOW OF BURNING SYMPATHY WAS SO FAR SLACKENED THAT ITS SPEECH DESCENDED TOWARDS THE MARK OF OUR INTELLIGENCE THE FIRST THING THAT WAS UNDERSTOOD BY ME WAS BENEDIGHT BE THOU O TRINE AND ONE
87-121553-0067 WHO HAST UNTO MY SEED SO COURTEOUS BEEN AND IT CONTINUED HUNGER LONG AND GRATEFUL DRAWN FROM THE READING OF THE MIGHTY VOLUME WHEREIN IS NEVER CHANGED THE WHITE NOR DARK THOU HAST APPEASED MY SON WITHIN THIS LIGHT IN WHICH I SPEAK TO THEE
87-121553-0068 BY GRACE OF HER WHO TO THIS LOFTY FLIGHT WITH PLUMAGE CLOTHED THEE THOU THINKEST THAT TO ME THY THOUGHT DOTH PASS FROM HIM WHO IS THE FIRST AS FROM THE UNIT IF THAT BE KNOWN RAY OUT THE FIVE AND SIX AND THEREFORE
87-121553-0069 WHO I AM THOU ASKEST NOT AND WHY I SEEM MORE JOYOUS UNTO THEE THAN ANY OTHER OF THIS GLADSOME CROWD THOU THINK'ST THE TRUTH BECAUSE THE SMALL AND GREAT OF THIS EXISTENCE LOOK INTO THE MIRROR WHEREIN BEFORE THOU THINK'ST THY THOUGHT THOU SHOWEST
87-121553-0070 BUT THAT THE SACRED LOVE IN WHICH I WATCH WITH SIGHT PERPETUAL AND WHICH MAKES ME THIRST WITH SWEET DESIRE MAY BETTER BE FULFILLED NOW LET THY VOICE SECURE AND FRANK AND GLAD PROCLAIM THE WISHES THE DESIRE PROCLAIM TO WHICH MY ANSWER IS DECREED ALREADY
87-121553-0071 OF THE SAME WEIGHT FOR EACH OF YOU BECAME FOR IN THE SUN WHICH LIGHTED YOU AND BURNED WITH HEAT AND RADIANCE THEY SO EQUAL ARE THAT ALL SIMILITUDES ARE INSUFFICIENT BUT AMONG MORTALS WILL AND ARGUMENT FOR REASON THAT TO YOU IS MANIFEST
87-121553-0072 DIVERSELY FEATHERED IN THEIR PINIONS ARE WHENCE I WHO MORTAL AM FEEL IN MYSELF THIS INEQUALITY SO GIVE NOT THANKS SAVE IN MY HEART FOR THIS PATERNAL WELCOME TRULY DO I ENTREAT THEE LIVING TOPAZ SET IN THIS PRECIOUS JEWEL AS A GEM
87-121553-0073 THAT THOU WILT SATISFY ME WITH THY NAME O LEAF OF MINE IN WHOM I PLEASURE TOOK E'EN WHILE AWAITING I WAS THINE OWN ROOT SUCH A BEGINNING HE IN ANSWER MADE ME THEN SAID TO ME THAT ONE FROM WHOM IS NAMED THY RACE
87-121553-0074 AND WHO A HUNDRED YEARS AND MORE HAS CIRCLED ROUND THE MOUNT ON THE FIRST CORNICE A SON OF MINE AND THY GREAT GRANDSIRE WAS WELL IT BEHOVES THEE THAT THE LONG FATIGUE THOU SHOULDST FOR HIM MAKE SHORTER WITH THY WORKS FLORENCE WITHIN THE ANCIENT BOUNDARY
87-121553-0075 FROM WHICH SHE TAKETH STILL HER TIERCE AND NONES ABODE IN QUIET TEMPERATE AND CHASTE NO GOLDEN CHAIN SHE HAD NOR CORONAL NOR LADIES SHOD WITH SANDAL SHOON NOR GIRDLE THAT CAUGHT THE EYE MORE THAN THE PERSON DID
87-121553-0076 NOT YET THE DAUGHTER AT HER BIRTH STRUCK FEAR INTO THE FATHER FOR THE TIME AND DOWER DID NOT O'ERRUN THIS SIDE OR THAT THE MEASURE NO HOUSES HAD SHE VOID OF FAMILIES NOT YET HAD THITHER COME SARDANAPALUS TO SHOW WHAT IN A CHAMBER CAN BE DONE
87-121553-0077 WHICH SURPASSED SHALL IN ITS DOWNFALL BE AS IN ITS RISE
87-121553-0078 AND FROM THE MIRROR HIS DAME DEPART WITHOUT A PAINTED FACE AND HIM OF NERLI SAW AND HIM OF VECCHIO CONTENTED WITH THEIR SIMPLE SUITS OF BUFF AND WITH THE SPINDLE AND THE FLAX THEIR DAMES O FORTUNATE WOMEN
87-121553-0079 ANOTHER DRAWING TRESSES FROM HER DISTAFF TOLD O'ER AMONG HER FAMILY THE TALES OF TROJANS AND OF FESOLE AND ROME AS GREAT A MARVEL THEN WOULD HAVE BEEN HELD A LAPO SALTERELLO
87-121553-0080 AS CINCINNATUS OR CORNELIA NOW TO SUCH A QUIET SUCH A BEAUTIFUL LIFE OF THE CITIZEN TO SUCH A SAFE COMMUNITY AND TO SO SWEET AN INN DID MARY GIVE ME WITH LOUD CRIES INVOKED AND IN YOUR ANCIENT BAPTISTERY AT ONCE CHRISTIAN AND CACCIAGUIDA I BECAME
87-121553-0081 MORONTO WAS MY BROTHER AND ELISEO FROM VAL DI PADO CAME TO ME MY WIFE AND FROM THAT PLACE THY SURNAME WAS DERIVED I FOLLOWED AFTERWARD THE EMPEROR CONRAD AND HE BEGIRT ME OF HIS CHIVALRY SO MUCH I PLEASED HIM WITH MY NOBLE DEEDS
87-121553-0082 I FOLLOWED IN HIS TRAIN AGAINST THAT LAW'S INIQUITY WHOSE PEOPLE DOTH USURP YOUR JUST POSSESSION THROUGH YOUR PASTOR'S FAULT THERE BY THAT EXECRABLE RACE WAS I RELEASED FROM BONDS OF THE FALLACIOUS WORLD
87-121553-0083 O THOU OUR POOR NOBILITY OF BLOOD IF THOU DOST MAKE THE PEOPLE GLORY IN THEE DOWN HERE WHERE OUR AFFECTION LANGUISHES A MARVELLOUS THING IT NE'ER WILL BE TO ME FOR THERE WHERE APPETITE IS NOT PERVERTED
87-121553-0084 I SAY IN HEAVEN OF THEE I MADE A BOAST TRULY THOU ART A CLOAK THAT QUICKLY SHORTENS SO THAT UNLESS WE PIECE THEE DAY BY DAY TIME GOETH ROUND ABOUT THEE WITH HIS SHEARS WITH YOU WHICH ROME WAS FIRST TO TOLERATE
87-121553-0085 WHEREIN HER FAMILY LESS PERSEVERES YET ONCE AGAIN MY WORDS BEGINNING MADE WHENCE BEATRICE WHO STOOD SOMEWHAT APART SMILING APPEARED LIKE UNTO HER WHO COUGHED
87-121553-0086 AND I BEGAN YOU ARE MY ANCESTOR YOU GIVE TO ME ALL HARDIHOOD TO SPEAK YOU LIFT ME SO THAT I AM MORE THAN I SO MANY RIVULETS WITH GLADNESS FILL MY MIND THAT OF ITSELF IT MAKES A JOY BECAUSE IT CAN ENDURE THIS AND NOT BURST
87-121553-0087 THEN TELL ME MY BELOVED ROOT ANCESTRAL WHO WERE YOUR ANCESTORS AND WHAT THE YEARS THAT IN YOUR BOYHOOD CHRONICLED THEMSELVES TELL ME ABOUT THE SHEEPFOLD OF SAINT JOHN HOW LARGE IT WAS AND WHO THE PEOPLE WERE WITHIN IT WORTHY OF THE HIGHEST SEATS
87-121553-0088 AS AT THE BLOWING OF THE WINDS A COAL QUICKENS TO FLAME SO I BEHELD THAT LIGHT BECOME RESPLENDENT AT MY BLANDISHMENTS AND AS UNTO MINE EYES IT GREW MORE FAIR WITH VOICE MORE SWEET AND TENDER BUT NOT IN THIS MODERN DIALECT IT SAID TO ME
87-121553-0089 FROM UTTERING OF THE AVE TILL THE BIRTH IN WHICH MY MOTHER WHO IS NOW A SAINT OF ME WAS LIGHTENED WHO HAD BEEN HER BURDEN
87-121553-0090 FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY TIMES AND THIRTY MORE TO REINFLAME ITSELF BENEATH HIS PAW MY ANCESTORS AND I OUR BIRTHPLACE HAD WHERE FIRST IS FOUND THE LAST WARD OF THE CITY BY HIM WHO RUNNETH IN YOUR ANNUAL GAME SUFFICE IT OF MY ELDERS TO HEAR THIS
87-121553-0091 BUT WHO THEY WERE AND WHENCE THEY THITHER CAME SILENCE IS MORE CONSIDERATE THAN SPEECH ALL THOSE WHO AT THAT TIME WERE THERE BETWEEN MARS AND THE BAPTIST FIT FOR BEARING ARMS WERE A FIFTH PART OF THOSE WHO NOW ARE LIVING BUT THE COMMUNITY THAT NOW IS MIXED
87-121553-0092 AND HIM OF SIGNA WHO HAS SHARP EYES FOR TRICKERY ALREADY HAD NOT THE FOLK WHICH MOST OF ALL THE WORLD DEGENERATES BEEN A STEP DAME UNTO CAESAR
87-121553-0093 SOME WHO TURN FLORENTINES AND TRADE AND DISCOUNT WOULD HAVE GONE BACK AGAIN TO SIMIFONTE THERE WHERE THEIR GRANDSIRES WENT ABOUT AS BEGGARS AT MONTEMURLO STILL WOULD BE THE COUNTS THE CERCHI IN THE PARISH OF ACONE PERHAPS IN VALDIGRIEVE
87-121553-0094 THE BUONDELMONTI EVER THE INTERMINGLING OF THE PEOPLE HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF MALADY IN CITIES AS IN THE BODY FOOD IT SURFEITS ON AND A BLIND BULL MORE HEADLONG PLUNGES DOWN THAN A BLIND LAMB AND VERY OFTEN CUTS BETTER AND MORE A SINGLE SWORD THAN FIVE
87-121553-0095 IF LUNI THOU REGARD AND URBISAGLIA HOW THEY HAVE PASSED AWAY AND HOW ARE PASSING CHIUSI AND SINIGAGLIA AFTER THEM TO HEAR HOW RACES WASTE THEMSELVES AWAY WILL SEEM TO THEE NO NOVEL THING NOR HARD
87-121553-0096 SEEING THAT EVEN CITIES HAVE AN END ALL THINGS OF YOURS HAVE THEIR MORTALITY EVEN AS YOURSELVES BUT IT IS HIDDEN IN SOME THAT A LONG WHILE ENDURE AND LIVES ARE SHORT AND AS THE TURNING OF THE LUNAR HEAVEN COVERS AND BARES THE SHORES WITHOUT A PAUSE
87-121553-0097 IN THE LIKE MANNER FORTUNE DOES WITH FLORENCE THEREFORE SHOULD NOT APPEAR A MARVELLOUS THING WHAT I SHALL SAY OF THE GREAT FLORENTINES OF WHOM THE FAME IS HIDDEN IN THE PAST I SAW THE UGHI
87-121553-0098 EVEN IN THEIR FALL ILLUSTRIOUS CITIZENS AND SAW AS MIGHTY AS THEY ANCIENT WERE WITH HIM OF LA SANNELLA HIM OF ARCA AND SOLDANIER ARDINGHI AND BOSTICHI NEAR TO THE GATE THAT IS AT PRESENT LADEN WITH A NEW FELONY OF SO MUCH WEIGHT
87-121553-0099 THAT SOON IT SHALL BE JETSAM FROM THE BARK THE RAVIGNANI WERE FROM WHOM DESCENDED THE COUNTY GUIDO AND WHOE'ER THE NAME OF THE GREAT BELLINCIONE SINCE HATH TAKEN HE OF LA PRESSA KNEW THE ART OF RULING ALREADY
87-121553-0100 AND ALREADY GALIGAJO HAD HILT AND POMMEL GILDED IN HIS HOUSE MIGHTY ALREADY WAS THE COLUMN VAIR SACCHETTI GIUOCHI FIFANT AND BARUCCI AND GALLI AND THEY WHO FOR THE BUSHEL BLUSH
87-121553-0101 THE STOCK FROM WHICH WERE THE CALFUCCI BORN WAS GREAT ALREADY AND ALREADY CHOSEN TO CURULE CHAIRS THE SIZII AND ARRIGUCCI O HOW BEHELD I THOSE WHO ARE UNDONE BY THEIR OWN PRIDE AND HOW THE BALLS OF GOLD FLORENCE ENFLOWERED IN ALL THEIR MIGHTY DEEDS
87-121553-0102 SO LIKEWISE DID THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE WHO EVERMORE WHEN VACANT IS YOUR CHURCH FATTEN BY STAYING IN CONSISTORY THE INSOLENT RACE THAT LIKE A DRAGON FOLLOWS WHOEVER FLEES AND UNTO HIM THAT SHOWS HIS TEETH OR PURSE IS GENTLE AS A LAMB
87-121553-0103 ALREADY RISING WAS BUT FROM LOW PEOPLE SO THAT IT PLEASED NOT UBERTIN DONATO THAT HIS WIFE'S FATHER SHOULD MAKE HIM THEIR KIN ALREADY HAD CAPONSACCO TO THE MARKET FROM FESOLE DESCENDED AND ALREADY GIUDA AND INFANGATO WERE GOOD BURGHERS
87-121553-0104 I'LL TELL A THING INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE ONE ENTERED THE SMALL CIRCUIT BY A GATE WHICH FROM THE DELLA PERA TOOK ITS NAME EACH ONE THAT BEARS THE BEAUTIFUL ESCUTCHEON OF THE GREAT BARON WHOSE RENOWN AND NAME THE FESTIVAL OF THOMAS KEEPETH FRESH
87-121553-0105 KNIGHTHOOD AND PRIVILEGE FROM HIM RECEIVED THOUGH WITH THE POPULACE UNITES HIMSELF TO DAY THE MAN WHO BINDS IT WITH A BORDER ALREADY WERE GUALTEROTTI AND IMPORTUNI AND STILL MORE QUIET WOULD THE BORGO BE IF WITH NEW NEIGHBOURS IT REMAINED UNFED
87-121553-0106 MANY WOULD BE REJOICING WHO ARE SAD IF GOD HAD THEE SURRENDERED TO THE EMA THE FIRST TIME THAT THOU CAMEST TO THE CITY BUT IT BEHOVED THE MUTILATED STONE WHICH GUARDS THE BRIDGE THAT FLORENCE SHOULD PROVIDE A VICTIM IN HER LATEST HOUR OF PEACE
87-121553-0107 WITH ALL THESE FAMILIES AND OTHERS WITH THEM FLORENCE BEHELD I IN SO GREAT REPOSE THAT NO OCCASION HAD SHE WHENCE TO WEEP
8747-293952-0000 THINGS WENT VERY SMOOTHLY AT GORE HALL AFTER DURHAM HAD ESTABLISHED LUCY AS ITS MISTRESS DURING THE ABSENCE OF BERNARD THE GIRL HERSELF FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT HER COUSIN WAS DEAD AND ASSUMED DEEP MOURNING
8747-293952-0001 AND FELT HIS LOSS DEEPLY IT WAS HER OUTSPOKEN AFFECTION THAT PROVOKED A QUARREL BETWEEN HER AND JULIUS AND WHICH LED TO THE BREAKING OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT LUCY HAD A HIGH TEMPER WHICH HAD BEEN KEPT IN SUBJECTION DURING THE LIFE OF SIR SIMON
8747-293952-0002 BUT NOW THAT SHE TASTED THE SWEETS OF POWER SHE WAS NOT DISPOSED TO ALLOW JULIUS TO TREAT HER AS HE CHOSE MISSUS GILROY CAME BACK FROM HER VISIT TO THE LAWYER
8747-293952-0003 SHE SAW THAT SHE HAD GONE TOO FAR AND HAD GIVEN DURHAM AN INKLING AS TO THE POSSIBILITY OF MICHAEL HAVING MASQUERADED AS BERNARD
8747-293952-0004 KNOWING THAT SHE HAD MARRIED WALTER GORE AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS A FLAW IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES UPON WHICH SHE BUILT HER CLAIM YET SHE TRUSTED TO HER OWN CLEVERNESS TO CONCEAL THIS FROM THE TOO CLEVER LAWYER BUT APART FROM THIS
8747-293952-0005 THE FACT THAT HE SUSPECTED SOMEONE OF PASSING HIMSELF OFF AS BERNARD STARTLED HER AND OPENED AN ABYSS AT HER FEET ON LEAVING THE OFFICE SHE JUDGED IT BEST TO LOWER HER CREST FOR THE MOMENT AND TO WAIT PATIENTLY TO SEE WHAT WOULD TRANSPIRE
8747-293952-0006 MISSUS GILROY WAS A WELL EDUCATED WOMAN AND VERY ASTUTE THEREFORE SHE HOPED TO GAIN HER ENDS BY CRAFT IF NOT BY FORCE SO FAR SHE HAD FAILED BUT SHE DID NOT INTEND TO ABANDON HER CLAIM
8747-293952-0007 FOR ONE FAILURE AS IT WAS SHE CAME BACK TO THE HALL AND BEHAVED HERSELF MUCH BETTER THAN SHE HAD EVER DONE BEFORE SHE WAS RESPECTFUL TO LUCY AND DID NOT DISPLAY HER IMPATIENCE OF COMMANDS THAT
8747-293952-0008 SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE NO ONE COULD HAVE BEEN MEEKER AND ALTHOUGH MISS RANDOLPH DID NOT LIKE OR TRUST THE WOMAN SHE HAD NO FAULT TO FIND WITH HER IN ANY WAY LUCY SUFFERED SEVERELY FROM THE SHOCK OF SIR SIMON'S TRAGIC DEATH
8747-293952-0009 AND FROM THE SUPPOSED DEATH OF SIR BERNARD IN FACT THE MATTER SO PREYED ON HER NERVES THAT SHE BECAME PROSTRATE AND DOCTOR PAYNE HAD TO BE CALLED IN HE WAS A HANDSOME AND POPULAR YOUNG DOCTOR WHO HAD PRACTICED IN HURSETON
8747-293952-0010 HE WAS NATURALLY VERY PLEASED AND WAS VERY ATTENTIVE A COMPLETE REST IS WHAT YOU NEED HE SAID TO MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0011 AND I WILL GIVE YOU A TONIC NATURALLY YOU SUFFER FROM THE TERRIBLE CIRCUMSTANCES OF SIR SIMON'S DEATH HE THOUGHT A MOMENT
8747-293952-0012 A CHEERFUL COMPANION WOULD DO YOU GOOD SHALL I ASK MISS MALLESON TO COME OVER IS SHE CHEERFUL ASKED LUCY LANGUIDLY I FEAR NOT DOCTOR SHE WAS ENGAGED TO MY COUSIN AND HIS DEATH HAS MADE HER SAD
8747-293952-0013 PROBABLY BUT SHE BEARS UP WONDERFULLY BUT THAT SHE IS IN MOURNING ONE WOULD HARDLY GUESS SHE HAD SUSTAINED SUCH A LOSS WAS SHE VERY MUCH ATTACHED TO MISTER GORE YES
8747-293952-0014 I NEVER SAW A MORE ATTACHED COUPLE DID YOU EVER MEET HIM ONCE AT MISS PLANTAGENET'S YOU KNOW I AM GREAT FRIENDS WITH THE OLD LADY I OFTEN VISIT HER NOT PROFESSIONALLY FOR SHE IS AS HEALTHY AS A TROUT IN A POND
8747-293952-0015 IS ALICE MISS MALLESON ALSO WELL IN VERY GOOD HEALTH AND APPEARS RESIGNED TO HER LOSS I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT SHE WOULD HAVE FELT IT MORE SAID LUCY PERPLEXED
8747-293952-0016 ALICE HAS SUCH A TENDER HEART DOCTOR PAYNE WAS DOUBTFUL SO FAR AS HE SAW MISS MALLESON WAS REMARKABLY CHEERFUL UNDER HER SORROW SHE IS PHILOSOPHIC MISS RANDOLPH
8747-293952-0017 I THINK HOWEVER IF YOU WOULD HAVE HER OVER TO SEE YOU IT WOULD DO BOTH HER AND YOURSELF GOOD I SHALL WRITE A NOTE TO HER TO DAY SAID LUCY I AM VERY FOND OF HER AND WE GET ON VERY WELL TOGETHER
8747-293952-0018 POOR ALICE I WISH BERNARD HAD LIVED
8747-293952-0019 RISING TO TAKE HIS LEAVE IF HE WAS GUILTY AH SAID LUCY RAISING HERSELF WITH ANIMATION FROM THE SOFA UPON WHICH SHE WAS LYING IF HE WAS GUILTY
8747-293952-0020 I DO NOT BELIEVE HE WAS
8747-293952-0021 BUT HE COULD NOT ALWAYS CONTROL IT AND WAS A KIND HEARTED BOY HE IS INNOCENT I AM SURE HOW ARE YOU SURE MY DEAR LUCY ASKED A THIRD VOICE AND SHE LOOKED UP TO SEE JULIUS STANDING IN THE DOORWAY
8747-293952-0022 HE CAME FORWARD FORGIVE ME IF I HEARD A FEW WORDS OF YOUR CONVERSATION BUT I HAVE JUST COME IN DOCTOR PAYNE I HOPE I SEE YOU WELL QUITE WELL SAID THE DOCTOR WHO DID NOT LIKE BERYL THINKING HIM
8747-293952-0023 IN SCHOOLBOY PHRASE A SNEAK I AM JUST GOING MISTER BERYL ARE YOU ILL LUCY ASKED BERYL WITH AFFECTION I HAVE AN ATTACK OF NERVES SHE REPLIED PETTISHLY
8747-293952-0024 POOR BERNARD'S DEATH HAS SHAKEN ME IT IS JUST AS WELL HE DID DIE THOUGH I HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT SAID PAYNE BUT I MUST TAKE MY LEAVE I WILL COME AND SEE YOU AGAIN MISS RANDOLPH AND REMEMBER WHAT I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0025 REST AND CHEERFUL COMPANY MISS MALLESON'S FOR CHOICE HE DEPARTED SMILING AND THEY HEARD HIM GALLOP OFF WHEN THE SOUND OF THE HORSE'S HOOFS DIED AWAY
8747-293952-0026 WHY DO YOU THINK BERNARD IS INNOCENT HE ASKED BECAUSE IF HE IS GUILTY HIS ACTION GIVES THE LIE TO HIS WHOLE LIFE JULIUS SHE REPLIED RAISING HERSELF ON HER ELBOW I CAN'T BELIEVE HE KILLED MY UNCLE
8747-293952-0027 SIR SIMON IS NOT YOUR UNCLE SAID BERYL JEALOUSLY YOU ARE ONLY A DISTANT RELATIVE PERHAPS MY MARRIAGE WITH YOU MAY MAKE ME A NEARER ONE
8747-293952-0028 IF WE EVER DO MARRY SAID JULIUS GLOOMILY SO FAR AS I AM CONCERNED I SHOULD LIKE TO BREAK THE ENGAGEMENT JULIUS WE WERE NEVER SUITED TO ONE ANOTHER BERYL'S VANITY WAS HURT
8747-293952-0029 WHY DID YOU ACCEPT ME THEN WHAT ELSE COULD I DO IT WAS SIR SIMON'S WISH THAT WE SHOULD MARRY AND OWING TO MY CIRCUMSTANCES I HAD NO CHOICE IN THE MATTER DURING HIS LIFE I WAS MERELY A PUPPET
8747-293952-0030 ALTHOUGH YOU SWORE FOR AN HOUR
8747-293952-0031 YOU TOLD SIR SIMON ABOUT BERNARD BEING IN LOVE WITH ALICE THAT THE POOR BOY MIGHT BE DISINHERITED BERYL DID NOT DENY THE CHARGE I BELIEVE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH BERNARD YOURSELF HE SAID
8747-293952-0032 NO BERNARD AND I ARE LIKE BROTHER AND SISTER BUT HE IS DEAD
8747-293952-0033 LUCY SAT UP ON THE SOFA AND PUSHED THE LOOSE HAIR BACK FROM HER FOREHEAD WHY DO YOU SAY THAT SHE ASKED SHARPLY JULIUS STARED AT THE FIRE I CAN'T UNDERSTAND DURHAM'S ATTITUDE HE SAID EVASIVELY
8747-293952-0034 HE MUST KNOW THAT BERNARD IS DEAD SEEING THAT THE COAT AND HAT WERE FOUND ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER NO MAN COULD HAVE LIVED IN THE COLD AND THE FOG YET IF DURHAM WAS SURE HE WOULD NOT HOLD THE ESTATE AGAINST BERNARD'S COMING
8747-293952-0035 MISTER DURHAM REQUIRES PROOF OF THE DEATH REJOINED LUCY SHARPLY AND UNTIL THEN HE IS BOUND TO ADMINISTER THE ESTATE ACCORDING TO THE WILL AS BERNARD'S BODY HAS NOT BEEN FOUND
8747-293952-0036 THERE IS ALWAYS A CHANCE THAT HE MAY HAVE ESCAPED I SINCERELY TRUST NOT AH YOU ALWAYS HATED BERNARD ON THE CONTRARY I SPEAK FOR HIS GOOD
8747-293952-0037 WHAT'S THE USE OF HIS COMING TO LIFE WHEN HE MUST SUFFER FOR HIS CRIME
8747-293952-0038 YOU HAVE NO GROUNDS FOR SAYING THAT SAID JULIUS PALE WITH RAGE I DON'T NEED GROUNDS RETORTED THE GENUINE WOMAN BERNARD ALWAYS WAS AS KIND HEARTED AS YOU WERE AND ARE THE REVERSE
8747-293952-0039 I AM NOT HARD HEARTED SNAPPED BERYL I ALWAYS DO GOOD
8747-293952-0040 NOT ALWAYS FOR INSTANCE I AM DOWN HERE TO GET A SMALL BOY A POST WITH MISS PLANTAGENET AS A PAGE THAT IS VERY GOOD OF YOU SAID LUCY SCORNFULLY AH YOU SEE I CAN DO A KIND ACTION
8747-293952-0041 THIS BOY IS A GRANDSON OF LORD CONNISTON'S HOUSEKEEPER MISSUS MOON AT COVE CASTLE SAID LUCY WITH SOME COLOR IN HER FACE I KNOW DO YOU KNOW LORD CONNISTON ASKED JULIUS SUSPICIOUSLY I HAVE MET HIM ONCE
8747-293952-0042 HE SEEMS TO BE A MOST DELIGHTFUL FELLOW WHAT A DELIGHTFUL SPEECH FOR A LADY SAID BERYL CONNISTON IS A SCAMP I HEARD HE ENLISTED IN THE LANCERS IT SHOWS HOW BRAVE HE IS EVERY MAN WORTH CALLING A MAN
8747-293952-0043 SHOULD GO TO THE FRONT PERHAPS YOU WOULD LIKE ME TO GO SNEERED JULIUS YOU WOULD NEVER HAVE THE PLUCK SAID LUCY QUICKLY ALL YOUR ENDS IN LIFE ARE GAINED BY CUNNING
8747-293952-0044 LUCY IF YOU TALK TO ME LIKE THAT BEGAN BERYL AND THEN RESTRAINED HIMSELF WITH AN EFFORT IT IS NO USE OUR QUARRELLING LET ME SHOW YOU THAT I AM NOT SO CARELESS OF OTHERS OR SO HARD HEARTED AS I SEEM TO BE
8747-293952-0045 MISS PLANTAGENET WANTS A PAGE I FOUND THIS LAD IN LONDON SELLING MATCHES HE WAS A MESSENGER BOY AT A TOBACCONIST CALLED TABERLEY AND LORD CONNISTON GOT HIM TURNED OUT OF THE SITUATION
8747-293952-0046 THE BOY TOLD ME HIMSELF HE WILL TELL YOU IF YOU LIKE TO SEE HIM I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM LORD CONNISTON IS TOO KIND A MAN TO BEHAVE IN THAT WAY HE WAS FOND OF BERNARD
8747-293952-0047 AND THAT MAKES HIM PERFECT IN YOUR EYES SAID BERYL LOOKING SAVAGE SEE HERE LUCY CONNISTON HAS LEFT THE ARMY SO YOU SEE HE IS NOT SO BRAVE AS YOU THINK
8747-293952-0048 HE LEFT SO AS TO SEEK AFTER BERNARD SAID LUCY QUICKLY MISTER DURHAM TOLD ME SO
8747-293952-0049 AND I BELIEVE BERNARD MAY BE ALIVE AFTER ALL IN WHICH CASE YOU WOULD GIVE HIM UP TO THE POLICE NO SAID JULIUS WITH AN EMOTION WHICH DID HIM CREDIT I SHOULD NEVER BETRAY HIM
8747-293952-0050 LUCY IF YOU CAN FIND OUT FROM LORD CONNISTON OR DURHAM THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE LET ME KNOW AND I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO TO HELP HIM HOW CAN YOU HELP HIM WHEN YOU BELIEVE HIM GUILTY I MIGHT HELP HIM TO ESCAPE
8747-293952-0051 I DON'T WANT TO SEE HIM HANGED HE WON'T BE HANGED IF LORD CONNISTON AND MISTER DURHAM CAN SAVE HIM AH JULIUS STARTED TO HIS FEET THEN HE IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0052 I CAN'T SAY I HAVE NO REASON TO THINK HE IS BUT I AM HOPING AGAINST HOPE SAID LUCY RISING I MERELY STATE WHAT WAS SAID MISTER DURHAM AND LORD CONNISTON BOTH TOLD ALICE THAT BERNARD WAS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0053 THEY WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT SNEERED BERYL WITH A WHITE FACE I BELIEVE THE FELLOW IS ALIVE AFTER ALL
8747-293952-0054 AND THEN ASKED LUCY STARTING UP AND FACING BERYL
8747-293952-0055 AH YOU WOULD MAKE HIM PAY MONEY TO SAVE HIMSELF I HAVE A RIGHT TO A PORTION OF THE ESTATE YOU HAVE NOT SAID MISS RANDOLPH CLENCHING HER FISTS AND ALL HER LANGUOR GONE BERNARD IS THE OWNER OF GORE HALL
8747-293952-0056 AND OF ALL THE PROPERTY AND OF THE TITLE ALSO
8747-293952-0057 HIS NAME WILL BE CLEARED AND THEN YOU WILL THROW ME OVER AND TRY TO BECOME LADY GORE I THROW YOU OVER NOW SAID LUCY LOSING HER TEMPER AND COLORING HOTLY HOW DARE YOU SPEAK TO ME LIKE THIS JULIUS
8747-293952-0058 I WILL NO LONGER BE BOUND TO YOU I NEVER LOVED YOU BUT I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO SEE THE BEST SIDE OF YOU BUT YOU HAVE NO GOOD SIDE YOU ARE A MEAN COWARDLY SERPENT AND IF BERNARD IS ALIVE I SHALL DO MY BEST TO DEFEND HIM
8747-293952-0059 FROM YOUR SNARES BUT LUCY DON'T SPEAK TO ME
8747-293952-0060 I GIVE YOU BACK YOUR RING HERE IT IS SHE WRENCHED IT FROM HER FINGER NOW LEAVE THE HOUSE MISTER BERYL I AM MISTRESS HERE JULIUS LOOKED AT THE RING WHICH SHE HAD THROWN AT HIS FEET AND LAUGHED
8747-293952-0061 YOU TAKE A HIGH TONE HE SAID SNEERINGLY BUT REMEMBER THAT IF BERNARD IS DEAD THE MONEY GOES TO CHARITIES SO MUCH THE BETTER YOU DO NOT GET IT NOR YOU EITHER
8747-293952-0062 YOU WILL HAVE TO TURN OUT OF THIS LUXURIOUS HOME AND LIVE ON THE PITTANCE SIR SIMON LEFT YOU WOULD I BE BETTER OFF IF I MARRIED YOU I THINK YOU WOULD I HAVE NOT MUCH MONEY NOW BUT I WILL HAVE SOME
8747-293952-0063 A GREAT DEAL SOME DAY BY BLACKMAILING BERNARD SAID LUCY INDIGNANTLY JULIUS PICKED UP THE RING AND SLIPPED IT INTO HIS WAISTCOAT POCKET CALMLY WE DON'T KNOW THAT BERNARD IS ALIVE
8747-293952-0064 BUT THE FACT OF CONNISTON LEAVING THE ARMY AND FROM DURHAM'S ATTITUDE I SHREWDLY SUSPECT HE IS AND IN HIDING
8747-293952-0065 AND THEN IT DEPENDS UPON HIM WHETHER HE IS HANGED OR PREFERS TO LIVE ABROAD ON A PORTION OF HIS MONEY THE LESSER PORTION I KNOW THE PRICE OF YOUR SILENCE SAID LUCY VEHEMENTLY YOU WILL WANT THE HALL AND A LARGE INCOME
8747-293952-0066 ALL I CAN GET REJOINED BERYL QUIETLY AND YOU HAVE REFUSED TO SHARE MY FORTUNE WITH ME YES I WILL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU AND REMEMBER THAT IF I CATCH YOU PLOTTING I WILL TELL MISTER DURHAM
8747-293952-0067 YOU CAN TELL HIM THE WHOLE OF THIS CONVERSATION SNARLED BERYL I AM NOT AFRAID OF DURHAM IF BERNARD IS ALIVE HE'LL HAVE TO PAY UP OR BE HANGED HE IS INNOCENT
8747-293952-0068 JULIUS SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS AND WALKED TO THE DOOR THERE HE PAUSED TO UTTER A FINAL INSULTING SPEECH I DON'T KNOW WHETHER YOU INTEND TO MARRY BERNARD OR LORD CONNISTON HE SAID BUT I WISH
8747-293952-0069 WHICH EVER IT IS JOY OF A SPITFIRE AND AN HONEST WOMAN SAID MISS RANDOLPH WRATHFULLY FOR THE REFERENCE TO CONNISTON TOUCHED HER NEARLY
8747-293952-0070 BUT YOU GO TOO FAST YOU CAN'T YET PROVE THAT BERNARD LIVES I GO TO DO SO SNEERED JULIUS AND BOWED HIMSELF IRONICALLY OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING LUCY FURIOUS BOTH WITH HIM AND WITH HERSELF
8747-293952-0071 SHE WAS ANGRY WITH HERSELF BECAUSE SHE FELT THAT IN SPEAKING OF CONNISTON SHE HAD COLORED AND AS A MATTER OF FACT SHE GREATLY ADMIRED THE YOUNG LORD EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD ONLY MET ONCE
8747-293952-0072 FOR CONNISTON WAS ONE OF THOSE IRRESISTIBLE MEN WHO APPEAL TO WOMEN LUCY THOUGHT BUT IT MATTERS LITTLE WHAT SHE THOUGHT ALL SHE KNEW WAS THAT HER ENGAGEMENT TO JULIUS WHICH HAD ALWAYS WEIGHED ON HER CONSCIENCE WAS AT AN END
8747-293952-0073 I AM FREE NOW FREE SHE SAID STRETCHING HER HANDS OH WHAT AN ESCAPE I HAVE HAD FROM THAT WICKED MAN HE HAS SHOWN HIS HAND TOO PLAINLY I WILL PUT MISTER DURHAM ON HIS GUARD AND
8747-293952-0074 HERE SHE BLUSHED AND LORD CONNISTON JULIUS WALKING TOWARDS THE BOWER WAS ALSO ANGRY WITH HIMSELF AS LUCY THOUGHT HE HAD SHOWN HIS HAND TOO CLEARLY
8747-293952-0075 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER HE CONSIDERED TO HAVE HELD MY TONGUE I SHOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD SHE NOT GOADED ME INTO SPEECH SHE WILL TELL DURHAM AND THAT INTERFERING CONNISTON AND PUT THEM ON THEIR GUARD WELL
8747-293952-0076 HE LAUGHED AND LOOKED AT THE SMALL BOY TROTTING BESIDE HIM I AM EQUAL TO BOTH THE BOY WAS A HANDSOME INNOCENT LOOKING LITTLE FELLOW RATHER UNDERSIZED
8747-293952-0077 WITH HIS CLEAR SKIN HIS FAIR HAIR AND WIDE BLUE EYES HE LOOKED LIKE THE CONVENTIONAL PICTURE OF A CHERUB
8747-293952-0078 BUT HIS MIND HAD NOT YET HAD TIME TO WORK ON HIS FACE AND THE MASK OF HIS CHILDHOOD FOR HE WAS ONLY THIRTEEN CONCEALED HIS EVIL NATURE SUCCESSFULLY IN A FEW YEARS WHEN HIS PASSIONS WORKED THEIR WAY THROUGH THE MASK HIS FACE
8747-293952-0079 WOULD BE WRINKLED AND SINFUL HIS MIND WOULD HAVE MARKED PLAINLY ITS SIGNET ON THE SMOOTH SURFACE BUT AT PRESENT HE LOOKED CHARMINGLY INNOCENT ALTHOUGH HE ALREADY KNEW MUCH MORE ABOUT LIFE THAN WAS GOOD FOR HIM
8747-293952-0080 JULIUS IN ORDER THAT THE LAD MIGHT MAKE AN IMPRESSION ON MISS PLANTAGENET HAD DRESSED HIM IN A NEW SUIT AND PLEASED WITH HIMSELF FOR MUCH OF THE BOY REMAINED IN THIS PRECOCIOUS CRIMINAL YOUNG JERRY TROTTED ALONG SMILING
8747-293952-0081 JERRY SAID BERYL LOOKING DOWN MIND YOU ARE NICE TO THE OLD LADY JERRY TOSSED HIS FAIR CURLS AND LOOKED ROGUISH OH THAT'S ALL RIGHT MISTER BERYL ALL OLD LADIES TAKE TO ME
8747-293952-0082 THEY THINK I'M A KIND OF HOLY BILL AND I LET THEM THINK SO IT PAYS JERRY YOU ARE A YOUNG SCAMP OF THE WORST THE BOY CHUCKLED AS THOUGH HE HAD RECEIVED A COMPLIMENT I LIKE DOING THINGS HE EXPLAINED FRANKLY IT'S FUN
8747-293952-0083 IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR VICTORIA
8747-293952-0084 YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT SUCH THINGS CORRECTED THE RESPECTABLE MISTER BERYL SEVERELY I KNOW A JOLLY SIGHT MORE THAN YOU THINK SAID THE URCHIN UNDER HIS BREATH AND PRODUCING A CIGARETTE JULIUS TOOK IT FROM HIM
8747-293952-0085 AND DULL SAID JERRY PUTTING HIS HANDS IN HIS POCKETS LORD WHAT A BORE STOPPING WITH HER WILL BE BUT I CAN NIP OVER AND SEE VICTORIA WHEN I LIKE AND KEEP AN EYE ON LORD CONNISTON AS I TOLD YOU
8747-293952-0086 I'M FLY SAID MASTER MOON AND BEGAN WHISTLING JULIUS LOOKED AT HIM WITH SATISFACTION HE INTENDED THAT THE BOY SHOULD REMAIN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD SO AS TO KEEP WATCH ON CONNISTON
8747-293952-0087 ON DURHAM AND ON ALICE MALLESON FOR THIS LAST REASON HE WAS INTRODUCING HIM INTO THE HOUSE IF BERNARD WERE ALIVE AS JULIUS BEGAN TO SUSPECT HE WOULD COME TO ONE OF THESE THREE PEOPLE AND THEN JERRY WOULD AT ONCE BECOME AWARE OF THE FACT
8747-293952-0088 MISS BERENGARIA WAS AS USUAL IN THE GARDEN LOOKING AFTER THE WELL BEING OF SOME WHITE CHRYSANTHEMUMS SHE RAISED HER HEAD WHEN SHE SAW HER VISITORS AND A LOOK OF ANNOYANCE CROSSED HER FACE WHEN SHE SAW MISTER BERYL
8747-293952-0089 AND BUT FOR THE SAKE OF ALICE SHE WOULD HAVE REFUSED TO LET HIM ENTER THE BOWER AS IT WAS AND WITH GREAT DIPLOMACY SO GREAT THAT IT DECEIVED EVEN THE ASTUTE BERYL SHE ASKED HIM TO COME INTO THE HOUSE
8747-293952-0090 LUCKILY ALICE WAS OUT OF THE WAY HAVING GONE TO PAY A VISIT BUT SHE WAS EXPECTED BACK MOMENTARILY AND MISS BERENGARIA WISHED TO GET RID OF JULIUS BEFORE THE GIRL RETURNED SHE MIGHT BE ABLE TO CONCEAL HER REAL FEELINGS BUT
8747-293952-0091 ALICE BEING SO YOUNG AND IMPULSIVE MIGHT SHOW HER DISLIKE TOO PLAINLY AND PUT BERYL ON HIS GUARD WHO IS THIS YOU HAVE HERE ASKED MISS PLANTAGENET PUTTING ON HER SPECTACLES AND SURVEYING JERRY WITH ADMIRATION WHAT A PRETTY LAD
8747-293952-0092 HE IS A LAD I WISH YOU TO HELP SAID BERYL BLANDLY LAST TIME WE MET MISS PLANTAGENET YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WANTED A PAGE NOT EXACTLY A PAGE SAID THE OLD DAME RUBBING HER NOSE
8747-293952-0093 A SURE SIGN SHE WAS PERPLEXED MERELY A BOY TO SEE AFTER THE FOWLS AND TO WAIT ABOUT THE HOUSE WHEN NECESSARY I LOVE FOWLS SAID JERRY SWEETLY AND LOOKING AS INNOCENT AS A BABE AND DOGS AND THINGS LIKE THAT
8747-293952-0094 YOU SEEM A NICE LAD WHO IS HE MISTER BERYL A POOR BOY WHO SOLD MATCHES IN LONDON BUT I DIDN'T ALWAYS PIPED JERRY SHIFTING FROM ONE LEG TO THE OTHER IN FEIGNED EMBARRASSMENT AND PLAYING HIS PART PERFECTLY
8747-293952-0095 I LIVED WITH GRANDMOTHER AT COVE CASTLE THAT'S LORD CONNISTON'S PLACE SAID MISS BERENGARIA MORE PERPLEXED THAN EVER WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE I LIVED WITH GRANDMOTHER MY NAME IS JERRY MOON
8747-293952-0096 HIS LORDSHIP GOT ME A SITUATION AT A TOBACCONIST'S SAID THE CHILD LIKE MOON AND THEN HE GOT ME TURNED OFF WHY THAT IS NOT LIKE LORD CONNISTON
8747-293952-0097 IT IS NOT TO LORD CONNISTON'S CREDIT BUT I MUST KNOW THE REASON SAID THE OLD DAME SHARPLY IF YOU WANT ME TO TAKE THE LAD INTO MY SERVICE JERRY IN ANSWER TO A LOOK OF BERYL'S BEGAN TO WEEP OSTENTATIOUSLY
8747-293952-0098 I SAW HIS LORDSHIP DRESSED AS A SOLDIER HE SNUFFLED AND I TOLD MISTER BERYL HIS LORDSHIP WAS SO ANGRY THAT HE GOT ME TURNED OFF SAYING I WAS UNGRATEFUL
8747-293952-0099 YOU SHOULD ALWAYS HOLD YOUR TONGUE SAID MISS BERENGARIA ANGRILY YOU HAD NO RIGHT TO TELL WHAT LORD CONNISTON WISHED KEPT SECRET IT WAS ONLY A FREAK ON HIS PART HE LEFT THE ARMY AT MY REQUEST
8747-293952-0100 AT YOUR REQUEST SAID JULIUS LOOKING AT HER DIRECTLY FOREARMED AS SHE WAS MISS BERENGARIA WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF BERNARD'S SECRET FLUSHED THROUGH HER WITHERED SKIN
8747-293952-0101 BUT TURNED THE CONVERSATION DEFIANTLY
8747-293952-0102 YES SWEET LADY DON'T TALK LIKE THAT CHILD CALL ME MA'AM
8747-293952-0103 MISTER BERYL SUCH A KIND GENTLEMAN MA'AM SAID YOU WOULD HELP ME I WILL SO LONG AS YOU ARE HONEST JERRY THRUST HIS TONGUE IN HIS CHEEK BUT JULIUS ANSWERED
8747-293952-0104 I CAN VOUCH FOR HIS HONESTY HE SAID BUT HE TALKS TOO MUCH HE MUST HOLD HIS TONGUE HERE SAID THE OLD DAME SEVERELY AND SHAKING HER TROWEL AT THE BOY WHERE ARE HIS CLOTHES I HAVE NONE BUT WHAT'S ON CRIED JERRY
8747-293952-0105 THE KIND GENTLEMAN GOT THEM FOR ME MA'AM YOU ARE A BETTER CHRISTIAN THAN I THOUGHT SAID MISS BERENGARIA LOOKING AT BERYL WELL YOU CAN STAY HERE BOY GO TO THE KITCHEN AND TELL THE SERVANTS TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING TO EAT
8747-293952-0106 JERRY GRINNED AND DUCKED TOWARDS THE DOOR GOOD BYE JERRY SAID BERYL KINDLY DON'T FORGET ME IF I DO MAY I BE OH NO KIND LADY I MEAN MA'AM I WON'T SWEAR
8747-293952-0107 I NEVER DID HAVING BEEN TO SUNDAY SCHOOL YES MA'AM I'M GOING AND JERRY IN ANSWER TO AN IMPERATIVE WAVE OF HIS NEW MISTRESS'S HAND DISAPPEARED MISS BERENGARIA TURNED TO BERYL
8747-293952-0108 I MUST SEE THAT HE DOESN'T SWEAR OR SMOKE OR INDULGE IN ANY OF THOSE WICKED THINGS I HOPE HE WILL DO YOUR RECOMMENDATION CREDIT MISTER BERYL I HOPE HE WILL SAID JULIUS AND FELT A STRONG INCLINATION
8747-293952-0109 THEN HE TOOK HIS LEAVE AND THE OLD LADY WATCHED HIM GO
8770-295462-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN HOW EMANCIPATION CAME TO PASS WHEN ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS A SMALL BOY HE BEGAN TO SHOW THE KEENEST SYMPATHY FOR THE HELPLESS AND OPPRESSED THE ONLY TIME HE BETRAYED ANGER AS A CHILD
8770-295462-0001 WHEN HE SAW THE OTHER BOYS HURTING A MUD TURTLE IN HIS FIRST SCHOOL COMPOSITION ON CRUELTY TO ANIMALS HIS STEPSISTER REMEMBERS THIS SENTENCE AN ANT'S LIFE IS AS SWEET TO IT
8770-295462-0002 AS OURS IS TO US AS YOU HAVE READ ON AN EARLIER PAGE WHEN ABE GREW TO BE A BIG STRONG BOY HE SAVED A DRUNKEN MAN FROM FREEZING IN THE MUD BY CARRYING HIM TO A CABIN
8770-295462-0003 NOT ONLY FROM MUD AND COLD BUT ALSO FROM A DRUNKARD'S GRAVE FOR THAT TALL LAD'S LOVE AND MERCY REVEALED TO THE POOR CREATURE THE TERRIBLE SLAVERY OF WHICH HE WAS THE VICTIM
8770-295462-0004 HE DELIVERED AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE WASHINGTONIAN TEMPERANCE SOCIETY IN WHICH HE COMPARED WHITE SLAVERY WITH BLACK IN WHICH HE SAID AND WHEN THE VICTORY SHALL BE COMPLETE
8770-295462-0005 THIS IS THE ONE HUNDRED AND TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE BIRTH OF WASHINGTON WE ARE MET TO CELEBRATE THIS DAY WASHINGTON IS THE MIGHTIEST NAME OF EARTH LONG SINCE THE MIGHTIEST IN THE CAUSE OF CIVIL LIBERTY
8770-295462-0006 STILL MIGHTIEST IN MORAL REFORMATION ON THAT NAME NO EULOGY IS EXPECTED IT CANNOT BE TO ADD TO THE BRIGHTNESS OF THE SUN OR GLORY TO THE NAME OF WASHINGTON IS ALIKE IMPOSSIBLE
8770-295462-0007 WHICH DID SO MUCH TO BRING ABOUT IN TIME A DOUBLE EMANCIPATION FROM WHITE SLAVERY AND BLACK ONCE AS PRESIDENT HE SAID TO A BOY WHO HAD JUST SIGNED THE TEMPERANCE PLEDGE NOW SONNY
8770-295462-0008 KEEP THAT PLEDGE AND IT WILL BE THE BEST ACT OF YOUR LIFE PRESIDENT LINCOLN WAS TRUE AND CONSISTENT IN HIS TEMPERANCE PRINCIPLES IN MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY FOUR HE WENT BY STEAMBOAT WITH HIS WIFE
8770-295462-0009 AND LITTLE TAD TO VISIT GENERAL GRANT AT HIS HEADQUARTERS AT CITY POINT VIRGINIA WHEN ASKED HOW HE WAS DURING THE RECEPTION WHICH FOLLOWED HIS ARRIVAL THERE THE PRESIDENT SAID AS RELATED BY GENERAL HORACE PORTER
8770-295462-0010 THAT'S THE BEST REMEDY I KNOW OF FOR SEA SICKNESS NO NO MY YOUNG FRIEND REPLIED THE PRESIDENT I'VE SEEN MANY A MAN IN MY TIME SEASICK ASHORE FROM DRINKING THAT VERY ARTICLE
8770-295462-0011 AND THE BITTEREST NAME HIS ENEMIES CALLED HIM WORSE IN THEIR MINDS THAN FOOL CLOWN IMBECILE OR GORILLA WAS A BLACK REPUBLICAN
8770-295462-0012 THE MORE THEY NEEDED HIS SYMPATHETIC HELP THE MORE CERTAIN THEY WERE TO RECEIVE IT MY SYMPATHIES ARE WITH THE UNDER DOG SAID MISTER LINCOLN ONE DAY THOUGH IT IS OFTEN THAT DOG THAT STARTS THE FUSS
8770-295462-0013 DID NOT MAKE HIM FORFEIT ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S SYMPATHY THAT WAS ONLY A GOOD LESSON TO HIM TO LOOK OUT AND DO BETTER NEXT TIME THE QUESTION OF EMANCIPATION
8770-295462-0014 IF THE GOVERNMENT COULD NOT BACK UP SUCH A DECLARATION THE OTHER PARTY DID NOT WISH THE MATTER TAMPERED WITH AS CHEAP LABOR WAS NECESSARY FOR RAISING COTTON SUGAR AND OTHER PRODUCTS ON WHICH THE LIVING OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE DEPENDED
8770-295462-0015 THE EXTREME ABOLITIONISTS WHO WISHED SLAVERY ABOLISHED WHETHER OR NO SENT MEN TO TELL THE PRESIDENT THAT IF HE DID NOT FREE THE SLAVES HE WAS A COWARD AND A TURNCOAT
8770-295462-0016 AND THEY WOULD WITHHOLD THEIR SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND THE ARMY DELEGATIONS OF ABOLITIONISTS FROM ALL OVER THE NORTH ARRIVED ALMOST DAILY FROM DIFFERENT CITIES TO URGE COAX AND THREATEN THE PRESIDENT
8770-295462-0017 WASHINGTON THE NATIONAL CAPITAL WOULD HAVE BEEN SURROUNDED AND FORCED TO SURRENDER BESIDES AT THIS TIME THE ARMIES OF THE NORTH WERE LOSING NEARLY ALL THE BATTLES
8770-295462-0018 IT WOULD BE LIKE THE POPE'S BULL OR DECREE AGAINST THE COMET A DELEGATION OF CHICAGO MINISTERS CAME TO BEG MISTER LINCOLN TO FREE THE SLAVES HE PATIENTLY EXPLAINED TO THEM
8770-295462-0019 COMPELS ME TO SAY TO YOU IN REPLY THAT IT IS A MESSAGE FROM OUR DIVINE MASTER THROUGH ME COMMANDING YOU SIR TO OPEN THE DOORS OF BONDAGE
8770-295462-0020 NOW ISN'T THAT STRANGE THE PRESIDENT REPLIED INSTANTLY HERE I AM STUDYING THIS QUESTION DAY AND NIGHT AND GOD HAS PLACED IT UPON ME TOO
8770-295462-0021 DON'T YOU THINK IT'S RATHER ODD THAT HE SHOULD SEND SUCH A MESSAGE BY WAY OF THAT AWFUL WICKED CITY OF CHICAGO THE MINISTERS WERE SHOCKED AT SUCH AN ANSWER FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295462-0022 THEY COULD NOT KNOW FOR MISTER LINCOLN DARED NOT TELL THEM THAT HE HAD THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION IN HIS POCKET WAITING FOR A FEDERAL VICTORY BEFORE HE COULD ISSUE IT THE PROCLAMATION
8770-295462-0023 THEN CAME THE NEWS OF ANTIETAM A TERRIBLE BATTLE BUT GAINED BY THE NORTHERN ARMS AT LAST THE TIME HAD COME TO ANNOUNCE THE FREEING OF THE SLAVES THAT THEY MIGHT HELP IN WINNING THEIR LIBERTIES
8770-295462-0024 THE PRESIDENT HAD NOT HELD A MEETING OF HIS CABINET FOR SOME TIME HE THOUGHT OF THE OCCASION WHEN AS A YOUNG MAN HE WENT ON A FLATBOAT TRIP TO NEW ORLEANS AND SAW
8770-295462-0025 I'LL HIT IT HARD NOW THE CHANCE TO HIT THAT THING THE INHUMAN MONSTER OF HUMAN SLAVERY HAD COME AND HE WAS GOING TO HIT IT HARD HE CALLED THE CABINET TOGETHER
8770-295462-0026 EDWIN M STANTON THE SECRETARY OF WAR HAS DESCRIBED THE SCENE ON THE TWENTY SECOND OF SEPTEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO I HAD A SUDDEN AND PEREMPTORY CALL TO A CABINET MEETING AT THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295462-0027 I WENT IMMEDIATELY AND FOUND THE HISTORIC WAR CABINET OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN ASSEMBLED EVERY MEMBER BEING PRESENT THE PRESIDENT HARDLY NOTICED ME AS I CAME IN
8770-295462-0028 LET ME READ YOU A CHAPTER THAT IS VERY FUNNY NOT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET SMILED AS FOR MYSELF I WAS ANGRY AND LOOKED TO SEE WHAT THE PRESIDENT MEANT IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE BUFFOONERY
8770-295462-0029 HE HOWEVER CONCLUDED TO READ US A CHAPTER FROM ARTEMUS WARD WHICH HE DID WITH GREAT DELIBERATION HAVING FINISHED HE LAUGHED HEARTILY WITHOUT A MEMBER OF THE CABINET JOINING IN THE LAUGHTER
8770-295462-0030 WELL HE SAID LET'S HAVE ANOTHER CHAPTER I WAS CONSIDERING WHETHER I SHOULD RISE AND LEAVE THE MEETING ABRUPTLY WHEN HE THREW THE BOOK DOWN HEAVED A LONG SIGH AND SAID
8770-295462-0031 GENTLEMEN WHY DON'T YOU LAUGH WITH THE FEARFUL STRAIN THAT IS UPON ME NIGHT AND DAY IF I DID NOT LAUGH I SHOULD DIE AND YOU NEED THIS MEDICINE AS MUCH AS I DO
8770-295462-0032 HE THEN PUT HIS HAND IN HIS TALL HAT THAT SAT UPON THE TABLE AND PULLED OUT A LITTLE PAPER TURNING TO THE MEMBERS OF THE CABINET HE SAID GENTLEMEN I HAVE CALLED YOU HERE UPON VERY IMPORTANT BUSINESS
8770-295462-0033 IT IS DUE TO MY CABINET THAT YOU SHOULD BE THE FIRST TO HEAR AND KNOW OF IT AND IF ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS TO MAKE AS TO THE FORM OF THIS PAPER OR ITS COMPOSITION I SHALL BE GLAD TO HEAR THEM
8770-295462-0034 WHICH WAS TO TAKE EFFECT THE FIRST OF JANUARY FOLLOWING SECRETARY STANTON CONTINUED I HAVE ALWAYS TRIED TO BE CALM BUT I THINK I LOST MY CALMNESS FOR A MOMENT AND WITH GREAT ENTHUSIASM I AROSE
8770-295462-0035 APPROACHED THE PRESIDENT EXTENDED MY HAND AND SAID MISTER PRESIDENT IF THE READING OF CHAPTERS OF ARTEMUS WARD IS A PRELUDE TO SUCH A DEED AS THIS THE BOOK SHOULD BE FILED AMONG THE ARCHIVES OF THE NATION
8770-295462-0036 AND THE AUTHOR SHOULD BE CANONIZED HENCEFORTH I SEE THE LIGHT AND THE COUNTRY IS SAVED AND ALL SAID AMEN AND LINCOLN SAID TO ME IN A DROLL WAY JUST AS I WAS LEAVING
8770-295462-0037 THAT DECLARATION YOUNG ABE LINCOLN FIRST READ IN THE GENTRYVILLE CONSTABLE'S COPY OF THE STATUTES OF INDIANA AT NOON ON THE FIRST OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
8770-295462-0038 WILLIAM H SEWARD SECRETARY OF STATE WITH HIS SON FREDERICK CALLED AT THE WHITE HOUSE WITH THE EMANCIPATION DOCUMENT TO BE SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT IT WAS JUST AFTER THE REGULAR NEW YEAR'S DAY RECEPTION
8770-295462-0039 MISTER LINCOLN SEATED HIMSELF AT HIS TABLE TOOK UP THE PEN DIPPED IT IN THE INK HELD THE PEN A MOMENT THEN LAID IT DOWN AFTER WAITING A WHILE HE WENT THROUGH THE SAME MOVEMENTS AS BEFORE
8770-295462-0040 TURNING TO HIS SECRETARY OF STATE HE SAID TO EXPLAIN HIS HESITATION
8770-295462-0041 LOOKING UP AT THE SEWARDS FATHER AND SON HE SMILED AND SAID WITH A SIGH OF RELIEF
8770-295463-0000 CHAPTER NINETEEN THE GLORY OF GETTYSBURG THE BATTLE
8770-295463-0001 IF LEE HAD BEEN VICTORIOUS THERE HE MIGHT HAVE DESTROYED PHILADELPHIA AND NEW YORK BY SUCH A BRILLIANT STROKE HE COULD HAVE SURROUNDED AND CAPTURED BALTIMORE AND WASHINGTON THIS WOULD HAVE CHANGED THE GRAND RESULT OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0002 IN POINT OF NUMBERS BRAVERY AND GENIUS THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WAS THE GREATEST THAT HAD EVER BEEN FOUGHT UP TO THAT TIME GLORIOUS AS THIS WAS
8770-295463-0003 THE GREATEST GLORY OF GETTYSBURG LAY IN THE EXPERIENCES AND UTTERANCES OF ONE MAN ABRAHAM LINCOLN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IT CAME AT A TERRIBLE TIME IN THE PROGRESS OF THE WAR
8770-295463-0004 ACCOUNTED VICTORY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE HIS EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION PROVED TO BE A DRAWN BATTLE WITH TERRIFIC LOSSES ON BOTH SIDES LEE WAS DRIVEN BACK FROM MARYLAND THEN IT IS TRUE
8770-295463-0005 BUT HE SOON WON THE GREAT BATTLES OF FREDERICKSBURG AND CHANCELLORSVILLE AND HAD MADE HIS WAY NORTH INTO PENNSYLVANIA THE NIGHT AFTER THE BATTLE OF CHANCELLORSVILLE
8770-295463-0006 WAS THE DARKEST IN THE HISTORY OF THE CIVIL WAR PRESIDENT LINCOLN WALKED THE FLOOR THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG CRYING OUT IN HIS ANGUISH O WHAT WILL THE COUNTRY SAY
8770-295463-0007 AFTER WINNING THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG WHICH THE PRESIDENT HOPED WOULD END THE WAR GENERAL MEADE INSTEAD OF ANNOUNCING THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE CONFEDERATE ARMY STATED THAT HE HAD DRIVEN THE INVADERS FROM OUR SOIL
8770-295463-0008 BELIEVING HE WAS ON GOD'S SIDE HE FELT THAT THE CAUSE OF RIGHT COULD NOT LOSE FOR THE LORD WOULD SAVE HIS OWN THE NEXT DAY JULY FOURTH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE CAME THE SURRENDER OF VICKSBURG
8770-295463-0009 THE STRONGHOLD OF THE GREAT WEST
8770-295463-0010 CALLING ON GENERAL SICKLES IN A WASHINGTON HOSPITAL FOR THE GENERAL HAD LOST A LEG ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED WHY HE BELIEVED THAT VICTORY WOULD BE GIVEN THE FEDERAL FORCES AT GETTYSBURG
8770-295463-0011 I WILL TELL YOU HOW IT WAS IN THE PINCH OF YOUR CAMPAIGN UP THERE WHEN EVERYBODY SEEMED PANIC STRICKEN
8770-295463-0012 THAT IF HE WOULD STAND BY OUR BOYS AT GETTYSBURG I WOULD STAND BY HIM AND HE DID AND I WILL THE PRESIDENT'S CALL ON GENERAL SICKLES WAS ON THE SUNDAY AFTER THE THREE DAYS BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG
8770-295463-0013 BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF THE GUNBOAT AT CAIRO ILLINOIS WITH THE GLAD TIDINGS FROM VICKSBURG WHICH ADDED NEW LUSTER TO THE PATRIOTIC JOY OF INDEPENDENCE DAY THE TELEGRAPH WIRES
8770-295463-0014 HAD BEEN SO GENERALLY CUT ON ALL SIDES OF VICKSBURG THAT THE NEWS WAS SENT TO CAIRO AND TELEGRAPHED TO WASHINGTON IN PROOF THAT HIS FAITH EVEN INCLUDED THE MISSISSIPPI BLOCKADE HE WENT ON BESIDES
8770-295463-0015 I HAVE BEEN PRAYING OVER VICKSBURG ALSO AND BELIEVE OUR HEAVENLY FATHER IS GOING TO GIVE US VICTORY THERE TOO BECAUSE WE NEED IT IN ORDER TO BISECT THE CONFEDERACY
8770-295463-0016 PROMINENT IN NATIONAL AND EDUCATIONAL AFFAIRS AND THE GREATEST LIVING ORATOR WAS INVITED TO DELIVER THE GRAND ORATION THE PRESIDENT WAS ASKED IF HE COULD TO COME AND MAKE A FEW DEDICATORY REMARKS
8770-295463-0017 BUT MISTER EVERETT WAS TO BE THE CHIEF SPEAKER OF THE OCCASION THE SUNDAY BEFORE THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE THE DATE OF THE DEDICATION THE PRESIDENT WENT WITH HIS FRIEND NOAH BROOKS
8770-295463-0018 TO GARDNER'S GALLERY IN WASHINGTON WHERE HE HAD PROMISED TO SIT FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPH WHILE THERE HE SHOWED MISTER BROOKS A PROOF OF EVERETT'S ORATION WHICH HAD BEEN SENT TO HIM AS THIS PRINTED ADDRESS COVERED TWO NEWSPAPER PAGES
8770-295463-0019 WHEN MISTER BROOKS ASKED ABOUT HIS SPEECH FOR THAT OCCASION MISTER LINCOLN REPLIED I'VE GOT IT WRITTEN BUT NOT LICKED INTO SHAPE YET IT'S SHORT SHORT SHORT
8770-295463-0020 DURING THE FORENOON OF THE EIGHTEENTH SECRETARY JOHN HAY WAS ANXIOUS LEST THE PRESIDENT BE LATE FOR THE SPECIAL PRESIDENTIAL TRAIN WHICH WAS TO LEAVE AT NOON FOR GETTYSBURG DON'T WORRY JOHN SAID MISTER LINCOLN
8770-295463-0021 DON'T HURRY BOYS THERE WON'T BE ANYTHING GOING ON TILL I GET THERE WHEN THE TRAIN STOPPED ON THE WAY TO GETTYSBURG A LITTLE GIRL ON THE PLATFORM HELD UP A BOUQUET TO MISTER LINCOLN LISPING FLOWERTH FOR THE PRETHIDENT
8770-295463-0022 HE REACHED OUT TOOK HER UP AND KISSED HER SAYING YOU'RE A SWEET LITTLE ROSEBUD YOURSELF I HOPE YOUR LIFE WILL OPEN INTO PERPETUAL BEAUTY AND GOODNESS
8770-295463-0023 ABOUT NOON ON THE NINETEENTH OF NOVEMBER THE DISTINGUISHED PARTY ARRIVED IN A PROCESSION AND TOOK SEATS ON THE PLATFORM ERECTED FOR THE EXERCISES THE PRESIDENT WAS SEATED IN A ROCKING CHAIR PLACED THERE FOR HIM
8770-295463-0024 THERE WERE FIFTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE WAITING
8770-295463-0025 WATCHING HER WHILE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES WAS FANNING HER TENDERLY THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR HER SHE GASPED I FEEL BETTER NOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY HUSBAND
8770-295463-0026 THE FACT THAT THE PRESIDENT WAS SPEAKING WAS SUFFICIENT NO MATTER WHAT HE SAID THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE APPLAUDED ABRAHAM LINCOLN IF HE HAD MERELY RECITED THE MULTIPLICATION TABLE
8770-295463-0027 WHICH THE PRESIDENT DECIDED TO ATTEND TAKING SECRETARY SEWARD WITH HIM HE CALLED ON AN OLD COBBLER NAMED JOHN BURNS OF WHOSE COURAGE IN THE BATTLE OF GETTYSBURG MISTER LINCOLN HAD JUST HEARD
8770-295465-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN PATRIOT THERE WAS NO MORE STURDY LITTLE PATRIOT IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY THAN LIEUTENANT TAD LINCOLN THE CHILD OF THE NATION
8770-295465-0001 NOR HAD THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES A MORE DEVOTED ADMIRER AND FOLLOWER THAN HIS OWN SMALL SON A WORD FROM HIS FATHER WOULD MELT THE LAD TO TEARS AND SUBMISSION OR BRING HIM OUT OF A NERVOUS TANTRUM WITH HIS
8770-295465-0002 WREATHED WITH SMILES AND A CHUCKLING IN HIS THROAT OF PAPA DAY MY PAPA DAY NO ONE KNEW EXACTLY WHAT THE BOY MEANT BY PAPA DAY IT WAS HIS PET NAME FOR THE DEAREST MAN ON EARTH
8770-295465-0003 AND IT WAS HIS ONLY WAY OF EXPRESSING THE GREATEST PLEASURE HIS BOYISH HEART WAS ABLE TO HOLD IT WAS THE SWEETEST WORD EVER HEARD BY THE WAR BURDENED CRUSHED AND SORROWING SOUL OF THE BROKEN HEARTED PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
8770-295465-0004 MISTER LINCOLN TOOK HIS YOUNGEST SON WITH HIM EVERYWHERE ON HIS GREAT MISSION TO FORTRESS MONROE AND THEY THE LONG AND THE SHORT OF IT THE SOLDIERS SAID MARCHED HAND IN HAND THROUGH THE STREETS OF FALLEN RICHMOND
8770-295465-0005 BECAME PERFECTLY RIGHT AND PROPER WHEN CERTAIN UNKNOWN FACTS WERE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WAVING THE STARS AND BARS OUT OF A WHITE HOUSE WINDOW FOR INSTANCE ONE NIGHT
8770-295465-0006 IN A SOLDIER'S UNIFORM IF HE DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER THAN THAT SAID ONE MAN HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT BETTER IT'S AN INSULT TO THE NORTH AND THE PRESIDENT OUGHT TO STOP IT AND APOLOGIZE TOO
8770-295465-0007 BUT THAT HIS HEART WENT OUT ALSO TO THE BOYS IN GRAY THE SOLDIERS WERE ALL BOYS TO HIM THEY KNEW HE LOVED THEM THEY SAID AMONG THEMSELVES HE CARES FOR US HE TAKES OUR PART
8770-295465-0008 WE WILL FIGHT FOR HIM YES WE WILL DIE FOR HIM AND A LARGE PART OF THE COMMON SOLDIER'S PATRIOTISM WAS THIS HEART RESPONSE OF THE BOYS TO THE GREAT BOY IN THE WHITE HOUSE
8770-295465-0009 FOR THE YOUNGER SOLDIERS THE REAL BOYS OF THE ARMY GOING ALWAYS WITH THE PRESIDENT HE HAD HEARD HIS PAPA DAY SAY OF SEVERAL YOUTHS CONDEMNED TO BE SHOT FOR SLEEPING AT THEIR POST OR SOME LIKE OFFENSE
8770-295465-0010 THAT BOY IS WORTH MORE ABOVE GROUND THAN UNDER OR A LIVE BOY CAN SERVE HIS COUNTRY BETTER THAN A DEAD ONE GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE WAS ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S MOTTO
8770-295465-0011 AND HE WANTED ALL OTHER BOYS TO HAVE A FAIR SHOW HIS OWN FATHER HAD BEEN TOO HARD WITH HIM AND HE WAS GOING TO MAKE IT UP TO ALL THE OTHER BOYS HE COULD REACH THIS PASSION FOR DOING GOOD TO OTHERS
8770-295465-0012 BEGAN IN THE LOG CABIN WHEN HE HAD NO IDEA HE COULD EVER BE EXERCISING HIS LOVING KINDNESS IN THE EXECUTIVE MANSION THE HOME OF THE NATION WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL WAS THE RULE OF HIS LIFE
8770-295465-0013 IN THE BACKWOODS AS WELL AS IN THE NATIONAL CAPITAL AND THE BOYS IN GRAY WERE HIS BOYS TOO BUT THEY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND SO THEY HAD WANDERED AWAY THEY WERE A LITTLE WAYWARD BUT HE WOULD WIN THEM BACK
8770-295465-0014 THE GREAT CHIVALROUS SOUTH HAS LEARNED SINCE THOSE BITTER RUINOUS DAYS THAT ABRAHAM LINCOLN WAS THE BEST FRIEND THE SOUTH THEN HAD IN THE NORTH TAD HAD SEEN HIS FATHER SHOW GREAT TENDERNESS TO ALL THE BOYS
8770-295465-0015 HE MET IN THE GRAY UNIFORM BUT THE PRESIDENT HAD FEW OPPORTUNITIES TO SHOW HIS TENDERNESS TO THE SOUTH THOUGH THERE WAS A SECRET PIGEONHOLE IN HIS DESK STUFFED FULL OF THREATS OF ASSASSINATION HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF DEATH
8770-295465-0016 AND THE COUNTRY ANY GOOD BUT IT HURT HIM DEEP IN HIS HEART TO KNOW THAT SOME OF HIS BELOVED CHILDREN MISUNDERSTOOD HIM SO THAT THEY WERE WILLING TO KILL HIM IT WAS NO ONE'S BULLET WHICH MADE ABRAHAM LINCOLN A MARTYR
8770-295465-0017 ALL HIS LIFE HE HAD SHOWN THE SPIRIT OF LOVE WHICH WAS WILLING TO GIVE HIS VERY LIFE IF IT COULD SAVE OR HELP OTHERS ALL THESE THINGS LITTLE TAD COULD NOT HAVE EXPLAINED
8770-295465-0018 BUT THEY WERE INBRED INTO THE DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF THE BIG FATHER AND THE SMALL SON WHO WERE LIVING IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS BOYS TOGETHER
8770-295465-0019 MISTER LINCOLN HAD WRITTEN A SHORT ADDRESS FOR THE OCCASION THE TIMES WERE SO OUT OF JOINT AND EVERY WORD WAS SO IMPORTANT THAT THE PRESIDENT COULD NOT TRUST HIMSELF TO SPEAK OFF HAND A FRIEND STEPPED OUT ON THE NORTHERN PORTICO WITH HIM
8770-295465-0020 TO HOLD THE CANDLE BY WHICH MISTER LINCOLN WAS TO READ HIS SPEECH LITTLE TAD WAS WITH HIS FATHER AS USUAL AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT HAD FINISHED READING A PAGE OF HIS MANUSCRIPT HE LET IT FLUTTER DOWN LIKE A LEAF OR A BIG WHITE BUTTERFLY
8770-295465-0021 FOR TAD TO CATCH WHEN THE PAGES CAME TOO SLOWLY THE BOY PULLED HIS FATHER'S COAT TAIL PIPING UP IN A MUFFLED EXCITED TONE GIVE ME NOTHER PAPER PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0022 IT SEEMED RIDICULOUS THAT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ALLOW ANY CHILD TO BEHAVE LIKE THAT AND HAMPER HIM WHILE DELIVERING A GREAT ADDRESS WHICH WOULD WIELD A NATIONAL IF NOT WORLD WIDE INFLUENCE
8770-295465-0023 WE MEET THIS EVENING NOT IN SORROW BUT GLADNESS OF HEART THE EVACUATION OF PETERSBURG AND RICHMOND AND THE SURRENDER OF THE PRINCIPAL INSURGENT ARMY AT APPOMATTOX GIVE HOPE OF A RIGHTEOUS AND SPEEDY PEACE
8770-295465-0024 AND WILL BE DULY PROMULGATED GIVE US DIXIE BOYS THEN HE WENT ON OUTLINING A POLICY OF PEACE AND FRIENDSHIP TOWARD THE SOUTH SHOWING A SPIRIT FAR HIGHER
8770-295465-0025 AND MORE ADVANCED THAN THAT OF THE LISTENING CROWD ON CONCLUDING HIS ADDRESS AND BIDDING THE ASSEMBLED MULTITUDE GOOD NIGHT HE TURNED TO THE SERENADING BAND AND SHOUTED JOYOUSLY GIVE US DIXIE BOYS PLAY DIXIE
8770-295465-0026 WE HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT TUNE NOW THERE WAS A MOMENT OF SILENCE SOME OF THE PEOPLE GASPED AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN THEY SAW TAD WAVING THE CONFEDERATE FLAG AT THE WINDOW
8770-295465-0027 AS MISTER LINCOLN CAME IN THROUGH THE DOOR AFTER SPEAKING TO THE CROWD MISSUS LINCOLN WHO HAD BEEN WITH A GROUP OF FRIENDS LOOKING ON FROM WITHIN EXCLAIMED TO HIM YOU MUST NOT BE SO CARELESS
8770-295465-0028 SOME ONE COULD EASILY HAVE SHOT YOU WHILE YOU WERE SPEAKING THERE AND YOU KNOW THEY ARE THREATENING YOUR LIFE THE PRESIDENT SMILED AT HIS WIFE THROUGH A LOOK OF INEXPRESSIBLE PAIN AND SADNESS AND SHRUGGED HIS GREAT SHOULDERS
8770-295465-0029 BUT STILL HE ANSWERED NOT A WORD THE SEPARATION OF THE TWO BOYS AT A LATE HOUR GOOD FRIDAY NIGHT THAT SAME WEEK LITTLE TAD CAME IN ALONE AT A BASEMENT DOOR OF THE WHITE HOUSE FROM THE NATIONAL THEATER
8770-295465-0030 AND SOME OF THE COMPANY HAD MADE A GREAT PET OF HIM
8770-295465-0031 LIKE A WOUNDED ANIMAL SEEING THOMAS PENDEL THE FAITHFUL DOORKEEPER HE WAILED FROM HIS BREAKING HEART TOM PEN TOM PEN THEY HAVE KILLED PAPA DAY THEY HAVE KILLED MY PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0032 AND NOW HIS MOTHER WAS DESPERATELY ILL AND HIS FATHER HAD BEEN KILLED TAD OF COURSE COULD NOT COMPREHEND WHY ANY ONE COULD BE SO CRUEL AND WICKED AS TO WISH TO MURDER HIS DARLING PAPA DAY
8770-295465-0033 WHO LOVED EVERY ONE SO HE WANDERED THROUGH THE EMPTY ROOMS ACHING WITH LONELINESS MURMURING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF PAPA DAY WHERE'S MY PAPA DAY I'M TIRED
8770-295465-0034 TIRED OF PLAYING ALONE I WANT TO PLAY TOGETHER PLEASE PAPA DAY COME BACK AND PLAY WITH YOUR LITTLE TAD YOUNG THOUGH HE WAS HE COULD NOT SLEEP LONG AT NIGHT
8770-295465-0035 HIS SENSE OF LONELINESS PENETRATED HIS DREAMS SOMETIMES HE WOULD CHUCKLE AND GURGLE IN AN ECSTACY AS HE HAD DONE WHEN RIDING ON HIS FATHER'S BACK ROMPING THROUGH THE STATELY ROOMS
8770-295465-0036 TAD OPENED HIS EYES WIDE WITH WONDER IS PAPA DAY HAPPY IN HEAVEN HE ASKED EAGERLY YES YES I'M SURE HE'S HAPPY THERE TADDIE DEAR NOW GO TO SLEEP
8770-295465-0037 PAPA DAY'S HAPPY I'M GLAD SO GLAD SIGHED THE LITTLE BOY FOR PAPA DAY NEVER WAS HAPPY HERE THEN HE FELL INTO HIS FIRST SWEET SLEEP SINCE THAT TERRIBLE NIGHT
8770-295465-0038 GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE THE FOND HEARTED LITTLE FELLOW WENT ABROAD WITH HIS MOTHER A FEW YEARS AFTER THE TRAGEDY THAT BROKE BOTH THEIR LIVES BY A SURGICAL OPERATION AND BY STRUGGLING MANFULLY
8770-295465-0039 HE HAD CORRECTED THE IMPERFECTION IN HIS SPEECH BUT THE HEART OF LITTLE TAD HAD BEEN BROKEN WHILE STILL A LAD HE JOINED HIS FOND FATHER IN THE BEYOND GIVE THE BOYS A CHANCE HAD AMOUNTED TO A PASSION WITH ABRAHAM LINCOLN
8770-295465-0040 FOR THIS AS FOR ALL THE INEQUITIES THE GREAT HEART OF THE WHITE HOUSE WAS PREPARED HIS SPIRIT HAD SHONE THROUGH HIS WHOLE LIFE AS IF IN LETTERS OF LIVING FIRE WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE WITH CHARITY FOR ALL
8797-294123-0000 TO ACHIEVE A CORRECT APPRECIATION OF THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0001 AND THEN ONE FINE DAY CROSS OVER THE YALU INTO MANCHURIA IT WOULD BE OF EXCEPTIONAL ADVANTAGE TO THE CORRECTNESS OF APPRECIATION DID HE CROSS OVER THE YALU ON THE HEELS OF A HOSTILE AND ALIEN ARMY
8797-294123-0002 WAR IS TO DAY THE FINAL ARBITER IN THE AFFAIRS OF MEN AND IT IS AS YET THE FINAL TEST OF THE WORTH WHILENESS OF PEOPLES TESTED THUS THE KOREAN FAILS
8797-294123-0003 HE LACKS THE NERVE TO REMAIN WHEN A STRANGE ARMY CROSSES HIS LAND THE FEW GOODS AND CHATTELS HE MAY HAVE MANAGED TO ACCUMULATE HE PUTS ON HIS BACK ALONG WITH HIS DOORS AND WINDOWS AND AWAY HE HEADS FOR HIS MOUNTAIN FASTNESSES
8797-294123-0004 LATER HE MAY RETURN SANS GOODS CHATTELS DOORS AND WINDOWS IMPELLED BY INSATIABLE CURIOSITY FOR A LOOK SEE BUT IT IS CURIOSITY MERELY A TIMID DEERLIKE CURIOSITY
8797-294123-0005 HE IS PREPARED TO BOUND AWAY ON HIS LONG LEGS AT THE FIRST HINT OF DANGER OR TROUBLE NORTHERN KOREA WAS A DESOLATE LAND WHEN THE JAPANESE PASSED THROUGH VILLAGES AND TOWNS WERE DESERTED
8797-294123-0006 THE FIELDS LAY UNTOUCHED THERE WAS NO PLOUGHING NOR SOWING NO GREEN THINGS GROWING LITTLE OR NOTHING WAS TO BE PURCHASED ONE CARRIED ONE'S OWN FOOD WITH HIM
8797-294123-0007 IN MANY A LONELY VILLAGE NOT AN OUNCE NOR A GRAIN OF ANYTHING COULD BE BOUGHT AND YET THERE MIGHT BE STANDING AROUND SCORES OF WHITE GARMENTED STALWART KOREANS SMOKING YARD LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING CHATTERING CEASELESSLY CHATTERING
8797-294123-0008 LOVE MONEY OR FORCE COULD NOT PROCURE FROM THEM A HORSESHOE OR A HORSESHOE NAIL UPSO WAS THEIR INVARIABLE REPLY UPSO CURSED WORD WHICH MEANS HAVE NOT GOT
8797-294123-0009 THEY HAD TRAMPED PROBABLY FORTY MILES THAT DAY DOWN FROM THEIR HIDING PLACES JUST FOR A LOOK SEE AND FORTY MILES BACK THEY WOULD CHEERFULLY TRAMP CHATTERING ALL THE WAY OVER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN
8797-294123-0010 AND THE GLOOM OF THE LANDSCAPE WILL BE FILLED WITH TALL FLITTING GHOSTS BOUNDING LIKE DEER WITH GREAT SPRINGY STRIDES WHICH ONE CANNOT BUT ENVY THEY HAVE SPLENDID VIGOUR AND FINE BODIES BUT THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO BEING BEATEN AND ROBBED WITHOUT PROTEST OR RESISTANCE
8797-294123-0011 BY EVERY CHANCE FOREIGNER WHO ENTERS THEIR COUNTRY FROM THIS NERVELESS FORSAKEN KOREAN LAND I RODE DOWN UPON THE SANDY ISLANDS OF THE YALU FOR WEEKS THESE ISLANDS HAD BEEN THE DREAD BETWEEN THE LINES OF TWO FIGHTING ARMIES
8797-294123-0012 THE AIR ABOVE HAD BEEN RENT BY SCREAMING PROJECTILES THE ECHOES OF THE FINAL BATTLE HAD SCARCELY DIED AWAY THE TRAINS OF JAPANESE WOUNDED AND JAPANESE DEAD WERE TRAILING BY
8797-294123-0013 ON THE CONICAL HILL A QUARTER OF A MILE AWAY THE RUSSIAN DEAD WERE BEING BURIED IN THEIR TRENCHES AND IN THE SHELL HOLES MADE BY THE JAPANESE AND HERE IN THE THICK OF IT ALL A MAN WAS PLOUGHING GREEN THINGS WERE GROWING
8797-294123-0014 YOUNG ONIONS AND THE MAN WHO WAS WEEDING THEM PAUSED FROM HIS LABOUR LONG ENOUGH TO SELL ME A HANDFUL NEAR BY WAS THE SMOKE BLACKENED RUIN OF THE FARMHOUSE FIRED BY THE RUSSIANS WHEN THEY RETREATED FROM THE RIVERBED TWO MEN WERE REMOVING THE DEBRIS
8797-294123-0015 CLEANING THE CONFUSION PREPARATORY TO REBUILDING THEY WERE CLAD IN BLUE PIGTAILS HUNG DOWN THEIR BACKS I WAS IN CHINA I RODE TO THE SHORE INTO THE VILLAGE OF KUELIAN CHING
8797-294123-0016 THERE WERE NO LOUNGING MEN SMOKING LONG PIPES AND CHATTERING THE PREVIOUS DAY THE RUSSIANS HAD BEEN THERE A BLOODY BATTLE HAD BEEN FOUGHT AND TO DAY THE JAPANESE WERE THERE BUT WHAT WAS THAT TO TALK ABOUT EVERYBODY WAS BUSY
8797-294123-0017 MEN WERE OFFERING EGGS AND CHICKENS AND FRUIT FOR SALE UPON THE STREET AND BREAD AS I LIVE BREAD IN SMALL ROUND LOAVES OR BUNS I RODE ON INTO THE COUNTRY EVERYWHERE A TOILING POPULATION WAS IN EVIDENCE
8797-294123-0018 THE HOUSES AND WALLS WERE STRONG AND SUBSTANTIAL STONE AND BRICK REPLACED THE MUD WALLS OF THE KOREAN DWELLINGS TWILIGHT FELL AND DEEPENED AND STILL THE PLOUGHS WENT UP AND DOWN THE FIELDS THE SOWERS FOLLOWING AFTER
8797-294123-0019 TRAINS OF WHEELBARROWS HEAVILY LOADED SQUEAKED BY AND PEKIN CARTS DRAWN BY FROM FOUR TO SIX COWS HORSES MULES PONIES OR JACKASSES COWS EVEN WITH THEIR NEWBORN CALVES TOTTERING ALONG ON PUNY LEGS OUTSIDE THE TRACES
8797-294123-0020 EVERYBODY WORKED EVERYTHING WORKED I SAW A MAN MENDING THE ROAD I WAS IN CHINA I CAME TO THE CITY OF ANTUNG AND LODGED WITH A MERCHANT HE WAS A GRAIN MERCHANT
8797-294123-0021 CORN HE HAD HUNDREDS OF BUSHELS STORED IN GREAT BINS OF STOUT MATTING PEAS AND BEANS IN SACKS AND IN THE BACK YARD HIS MILLSTONES WENT ROUND AND ROUND GRINDING OUT MEAL ALSO IN HIS BACK YARD WERE BUILDINGS CONTAINING VATS SUNK INTO THE GROUND
8797-294123-0022 AND HERE THE TANNERS WERE AT WORK MAKING LEATHER I BOUGHT A MEASURE OF CORN FROM MINE HOST FOR MY HORSES AND HE OVERCHARGED ME THIRTY CENTS I WAS IN CHINA ANTUNG WAS JAMMED WITH JAPANESE TROOPS
8797-294123-0023 IT WAS THE THICK OF WAR BUT IT DID NOT MATTER THE WORK OF ANTUNG WENT ON JUST THE SAME THE SHOPS WERE WIDE OPEN THE STREETS WERE LINED WITH PEDLARS ONE COULD BUY ANYTHING GET ANYTHING MADE
8797-294123-0024 I DINED AT A CHINESE RESTAURANT CLEANSED MYSELF AT A PUBLIC BATH IN A PRIVATE TUB WITH A SMALL BOY TO ASSIST IN THE SCRUBBING I BOUGHT CONDENSED MILK BITTER CANNED VEGETABLES BREAD AND CAKE I REPEAT IT CAKE GOOD CAKE
8797-294123-0025 I BOUGHT KNIVES FORKS AND SPOONS GRANITE WARE DISHES AND MUGS THERE WERE HORSESHOES AND HORSESHOERS A WORKER IN IRON REALIZED FOR ME NEW DESIGNS OF MINE FOR MY TENT POLES MY SHOES WERE SENT OUT TO BE REPAIRED
8797-294123-0026 A BARBER SHAMPOOED MY HAIR A SERVANT RETURNED WITH CORN BEEF IN TINS A BOTTLE OF PORT ANOTHER OF COGNAC AND BEER
8797-294123-0027 TO WASH OUT FROM MY THROAT THE DUST OF AN ARMY IT WAS THE LAND OF CANAAN I WAS IN CHINA THE KOREAN IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INEFFICIENCY OF UTTER WORTHLESSNESS
8797-294123-0028 THE CHINESE IS THE PERFECT TYPE OF INDUSTRY FOR SHEER WORK NO WORKER IN THE WORLD CAN COMPARE WITH HIM WORK IS THE BREATH OF HIS NOSTRILS IT IS HIS SOLUTION OF EXISTENCE
8797-294123-0029 LIBERTY TO HIM EPITOMIZES ITSELF IN ACCESS TO THE MEANS OF TOIL TO TILL THE SOIL AND LABOUR INTERMINABLY WITH RUDE IMPLEMENTS AND UTENSILS IS ALL HE ASKS OF LIFE AND OF THE POWERS THAT BE
8797-294123-0030 WORK IS WHAT HE DESIRES ABOVE ALL THINGS AND HE WILL WORK AT ANYTHING FOR ANYBODY DURING THE TAKING OF THE TAKU FORTS HE CARRIED SCALING LADDERS AT THE HEADS OF THE STORMING COLUMNS AND PLANTED THEM AGAINST THE WALLS
8797-294123-0031 HE DID THIS NOT FROM A SENSE OF PATRIOTISM BUT FOR THE INVADING FOREIGN DEVILS BECAUSE THEY PAID HIM A DAILY WAGE OF FIFTY CENTS HE IS NOT FRIGHTENED BY WAR HE ACCEPTS IT AS HE DOES RAIN AND SUNSHINE THE CHANGING OF THE SEASONS AND OTHER NATURAL PHENOMENA
8797-294123-0032 HE PREPARES FOR IT ENDURES IT AND SURVIVES IT AND WHEN THE TIDE OF BATTLE SWEEPS BY
8797-294123-0033 HE IS SEEN CALMLY BENDING TO HIS USUAL TASKS NAY WAR ITSELF BEARS FRUITS WHEREOF HE MAY PICK BEFORE THE DEAD ARE COLD OR THE BURIAL SQUADS HAVE ARRIVED HE IS OUT ON THE FIELD
8797-294123-0034 STRIPPING THE MANGLED BODIES COLLECTING THE SHRAPNEL AND FERRETING IN THE SHELL HOLES FOR SLIVERS AND FRAGMENTS OF IRON THE CHINESE IS NO COWARD
8797-294123-0035 HE DOES NOT HIDE AWAY HIS CHICKENS AND HIS EGGS NOR ANY OTHER COMMODITY HE POSSESSES HE PROCEEDS AT ONCE TO OFFER THEM FOR SALE NOR IS HE TO BE BULLIED INTO LOWERING HIS PRICE
8797-294123-0036 HE HAS TWO LARGE PEARS SAVED OVER FROM LAST YEAR WHICH HE WILL SELL FOR FIVE SEN OR FOR THE SAME PRICE THREE SMALL PEARS WHAT IF ONE SOLDIER PERSIST IN TAKING AWAY WITH HIM THREE LARGE PEARS WHAT IF THERE BE TWENTY OTHER SOLDIERS JOSTLING ABOUT HIM
8797-294123-0037 AND THE SOLDIER RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR FLIGHT
8797-294123-0038 NOR IS THE CHINESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE WHICH HE HAS BEEN SO OFTEN DESIGNATED HE IS NOT SO ILL DISPOSED TOWARD NEW IDEAS AND NEW METHODS AS HIS HISTORY WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE TRUE
8797-294123-0039 HIS FORMS CUSTOMS AND METHODS HAVE BEEN PERMANENT THESE MANY CENTURIES BUT THIS HAS BEEN DUE TO THE FACT THAT HIS GOVERNMENT WAS IN THE HANDS OF THE LEARNED CLASSES AND THAT THESE GOVERNING SCHOLARS FOUND THEIR SALVATION LAY IN SUPPRESSING ALL PROGRESSIVE IDEAS
8797-294123-0040 AND BEEN SPREAD BY THEIR PAMPHLETS AND PROPAGANDISTS ORIGINALITY AND ENTERPRISE HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED IN THE CHINESE FOR SCORES OF GENERATIONS ONLY HAS REMAINED TO HIM INDUSTRY
8797-294123-0041 ON THE OTHER HAND HIS SUSCEPTIBILITY TO NEW IDEAS HAS BEEN WELL DEMONSTRATED WHEREVER HE HAS ESCAPED BEYOND THE RESTRICTIONS IMPOSED UPON HIM BY HIS GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS THE BUSINESS MAN IS CONCERNED HE HAS GRASPED FAR MORE CLEARLY THE WESTERN CODE OF BUSINESS
8797-294123-0042 THE WESTERN ETHICS OF BUSINESS THAN HAS THE JAPANESE HE HAS LEARNED AS A MATTER OF COURSE TO KEEP HIS WORD OR HIS BOND AS YET THE JAPANESE BUSINESS MAN HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN HE HAS SIGNED A TIME CONTRACT
8797-294123-0043 AND WHEN CHANGING CONDITIONS CAUSE HIM TO LOSE BY IT THE JAPANESE MERCHANT CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT IT IS BEYOND HIS COMPREHENSION AND REPULSIVE TO HIS COMMON SENSE THAT HE SHOULD LIVE UP TO HIS CONTRACT AND THEREBY LOSE MONEY
8797-294123-0044 HE FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT THE CHANGING CONDITIONS THEMSELVES ABSOLVE HIM AND IN SO FAR ADAPTABLE AS HE HAS SHOWN HIMSELF TO BE IN OTHER RESPECTS
8797-294123-0045 HERE WE HAVE THE CHINESE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF HIM OCCUPYING A VAST LAND OF IMMENSE NATURAL RESOURCES RESOURCES OF A TWENTIETH CENTURY AGE OF A MACHINE AGE
8797-294123-0046 RESOURCES OF COAL AND IRON WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF COMMERCIAL CIVILIZATION
8797-294123-0047 TRULY WOULD HE OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE THE MUCH HERALDED YELLOW PERIL WERE IT NOT FOR HIS PRESENT MANAGEMENT THIS MANAGEMENT HIS GOVERNMENT IS SET CRYSTALLIZED IT IS WHAT BINDS HIM DOWN TO BUILDING AS HIS FATHERS BUILT
8797-294123-0048 THE GOVERNING CLASS ENTRENCHED BY THE PRECEDENT AND POWER OF CENTURIES AND BY THE STAMP IT HAS PUT UPON HIS MIND WILL NEVER FREE HIM IT WOULD BE THE SUICIDE OF THE GOVERNING CLASS AND THE GOVERNING CLASS KNOWS IT
8797-294123-0049 COMES NOW THE JAPANESE ON THE STREETS OF ANTUNG OF FENG WANG CHANG OR OF ANY OTHER MANCHURIAN CITY THE FOLLOWING IS A FAMILIAR SCENE
8797-294123-0050 ON ONE SIDE SQUATS A CHINESE CIVILIAN ON HIS HAMS ON THE OTHER SIDE SQUATS A JAPANESE SOLDIER
8797-294123-0051 THE OTHER NODS UNDERSTANDING SWEEPS THE DUST SLATE LEVEL WITH HIS HAND AND WITH HIS FOREFINGER INSCRIBES SIMILAR CHARACTERS THEY ARE TALKING THEY CANNOT SPEAK TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY CAN WRITE
8797-294123-0052 LONG AGO ONE BORROWED THE OTHER'S WRITTEN LANGUAGE AND LONG BEFORE THAT UNTOLD GENERATIONS AGO THEY DIVERGED FROM A COMMON ROOT THE ANCIENT MONGOL STOCK THERE HAVE BEEN CHANGES
8797-294123-0053 DIFFERENTIATIONS BROUGHT ABOUT BY DIVERSE CONDITIONS AND INFUSIONS OF OTHER BLOOD BUT DOWN AT THE BOTTOM OF THEIR BEING TWISTED INTO THE FIBRES OF THEM IS A HERITAGE IN COMMON A SAMENESS IN KIND WHICH TIME HAS NOT OBLITERATED
8797-294123-0054 THE INFUSION OF OTHER BLOOD MALAY PERHAPS HAS MADE THE JAPANESE A RACE OF MASTERY AND POWER A FIGHTING RACE THROUGH ALL ITS HISTORY A RACE WHICH HAS ALWAYS DESPISED COMMERCE AND EXALTED FIGHTING TO DAY
8797-294123-0055 EQUIPPED WITH THE FINEST MACHINES AND SYSTEMS OF DESTRUCTION THE CAUCASIAN MIND HAS DEVISED HANDLING MACHINES AND SYSTEMS WITH REMARKABLE AND DEADLY ACCURACY THIS REJUVENESCENT JAPANESE RACE HAS EMBARKED ON A COURSE OF CONQUEST THE GOAL OF WHICH NO MAN KNOWS
8797-294123-0056 THE HEAD MEN OF JAPAN ARE DREAMING AMBITIOUSLY AND THE PEOPLE ARE DREAMING BLINDLY A NAPOLEONIC DREAM AND TO THIS DREAM THE JAPANESE CLINGS AND WILL CLING WITH BULL DOG TENACITY THE SOLDIER SHOUTING NIPPON BANZAI
8797-294123-0057 HER SOLE SUPPORT MAY GO TO THE FRONT ARE BOTH EXPRESSING THE UNANIMITY OF THE DREAM THE LATE DISTURBANCE IN THE FAR EAST MARKED THE CLASHING OF THE DREAMS FOR THE SLAV TOO IS DREAMING GREATLY
8797-294123-0058 GRANTING THAT THE JAPANESE CAN HURL BACK THE SLAV AND THAT THE TWO GREAT BRANCHES OF THE ANGLO SAXON RACE DO NOT DESPOIL HIM OF HIS SPOILS THE JAPANESE DREAM TAKES ON SUBSTANTIALITY
8797-294123-0059 BUT GIVEN POOR EMPTY KOREA FOR A BREEDING COLONY AND MANCHURIA FOR A GRANARY AND AT ONCE THE JAPANESE BEGINS TO INCREASE BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVEN SO HE WOULD NOT OF HIMSELF CONSTITUTE A BROWN PERIL
8797-294123-0060 HE HAS NOT THE TIME IN WHICH TO GROW AND REALIZE THE DREAM HE IS ONLY FORTY FIVE MILLIONS AND SO FAST DOES THE ECONOMIC EXPLOITATION OF THE PLANET HURRY ON THE PLANET'S PARTITION AMONGST THE WESTERN PEOPLES THAT BEFORE HE COULD ATTAIN THE STATURE REQUISITE TO MENACE
8797-294123-0061 HE WOULD SEE THE WESTERN GIANTS IN POSSESSION OF THE VERY STUFF OF HIS DREAM THE MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD LIES NOT IN THE LITTLE BROWN MAN BUT IN THE FOUR HUNDRED MILLIONS OF YELLOW MEN SHOULD THE LITTLE BROWN MAN UNDERTAKE THEIR MANAGEMENT
8797-294123-0062 THE CHINESE IS NOT DEAD TO NEW IDEAS HE IS AN EFFICIENT WORKER MAKES A GOOD SOLDIER AND IS WEALTHY IN THE ESSENTIAL MATERIALS OF A MACHINE AGE UNDER A CAPABLE MANAGEMENT HE WILL GO FAR
8797-294123-0063 THE JAPANESE IS PREPARED AND FIT TO UNDERTAKE THIS MANAGEMENT NOT ONLY HAS HE PROVED HIMSELF AN APT IMITATOR OF WESTERN MATERIAL PROGRESS A STURDY WORKER AND A CAPABLE ORGANIZER BUT HE IS FAR MORE FIT TO MANAGE THE CHINESE THAN ARE WE
8797-294123-0064 THE BAFFLING ENIGMA OF THE CHINESE CHARACTER IS NO BAFFLING ENIGMA TO HIM HE UNDERSTANDS AS WE COULD NEVER SCHOOL OURSELVES NOR HOPE TO UNDERSTAND THEIR MENTAL PROCESSES ARE LARGELY THE SAME
8797-294123-0065 HE THINKS WITH THE SAME THOUGHT SYMBOLS AS DOES THE CHINESE AND HE THINKS IN THE SAME PECULIAR GROOVES HE GOES ON WHERE WE ARE BALKED BY THE OBSTACLES OF INCOMPREHENSION HE TAKES THE TURNING WHICH WE CANNOT PERCEIVE
8797-294123-0066 TWISTS AROUND THE OBSTACLE AND PRESTO IS OUT OF SIGHT IN THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE CHINESE MIND WHERE WE CANNOT FOLLOW THE CHINESE HAS BEEN CALLED THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE AND WELL HE HAS MERITED IT DOZING AS HE HAS THROUGH THE AGES
8797-294123-0067 AND AS TRULY WAS THE JAPANESE THE TYPE OF PERMANENCE UP TO A GENERATION AGO
8797-294123-0068 THE IDEAS OF THE WEST WERE THE LEAVEN WHICH QUICKENED THE JAPANESE AND THE IDEAS OF THE WEST TRANSMITTED BY THE JAPANESE MIND INTO IDEAS JAPANESE MAY WELL MAKE THE LEAVEN POWERFUL ENOUGH TO QUICKEN THE CHINESE
8797-294123-0069 WE HAVE HAD AFRICA FOR THE AFRIKANDER AND AT NO DISTANT DAY WE SHALL HEAR ASIA FOR THE ASIATIC FOUR HUNDRED MILLION INDEFATIGABLE WORKERS DEFT INTELLIGENT AND UNAFRAID TO DIE AROUSED AND REJUVENESCENT
8797-294123-0070 MANAGED AND GUIDED BY FORTY FIVE MILLION ADDITIONAL HUMAN BEINGS WHO ARE SPLENDID FIGHTING ANIMALS SCIENTIFIC AND MODERN CONSTITUTE THAT MENACE TO THE WESTERN WORLD WHICH HAS BEEN WELL NAMED THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0071 THE POSSIBILITY OF RACE ADVENTURE HAS NOT PASSED AWAY WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF OUR OWN THE SLAV IS JUST GIRDING HIMSELF UP TO BEGIN WHY MAY NOT THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN START OUT ON AN ADVENTURE AS TREMENDOUS AS OUR OWN AND MORE STRIKINGLY UNIQUE
8797-294123-0072 IT IS NOT THE NATURE OF LIFE TO BELIEVE ITSELF WEAK THERE IS SUCH A THING AS RACE EGOTISM AS WELL AS CREATURE EGOTISM AND A VERY GOOD THING IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE WESTERN WORLD WILL NOT PERMIT THE RISE OF THE YELLOW PERIL
8797-294123-0073 IT ADVANCES THIS IDEA WITH PERSISTENCY AND DELIVERS ITSELF OF LONG ARGUMENTS SHOWING HOW AND WHY THIS MENACE WILL NOT BE PERMITTED TO ARISE
8797-294123-0074 THE WESTERN WORLD IS WARNED IF NOT ARMED AGAINST THE POSSIBILITY OF IT IN THE SECOND PLACE THERE IS A WEAKNESS INHERENT IN THE BROWN MAN WHICH WILL BRING HIS ADVENTURE TO NAUGHT FROM THE WEST HE HAS BORROWED ALL OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT AND PASSED OUR ETHICAL ACHIEVEMENT BY
8797-294123-0075 OUR ENGINES OF PRODUCTION AND DESTRUCTION HE HAS MADE HIS WHAT WAS ONCE SOLELY OURS HE NOW DUPLICATES RIVALLING OUR MERCHANTS IN THE COMMERCE OF THE EAST THRASHING THE RUSSIAN ON SEA AND LAND A MARVELLOUS IMITATOR TRULY
8797-294123-0076 BUT IMITATING US ONLY IN THINGS MATERIAL THINGS SPIRITUAL CANNOT BE IMITATED THEY MUST BE FELT AND LIVED WOVEN INTO THE VERY FABRIC OF LIFE AND HERE THE JAPANESE FAILS
8797-294123-0077 IT REQUIRED NO REVOLUTION OF HIS NATURE TO LEARN TO CALCULATE THE RANGE AND FIRE A FIELD GUN OR TO MARCH THE GOOSE STEP IT WAS A MERE MATTER OF TRAINING OUR MATERIAL ACHIEVEMENT IS THE PRODUCT OF OUR INTELLECT
8797-294123-0078 IT IS KNOWLEDGE AND KNOWLEDGE LIKE COIN IS INTERCHANGEABLE IT IS NOT WRAPPED UP IN THE HEREDITY OF THE NEW BORN CHILD BUT IS SOMETHING TO BE ACQUIRED AFTERWARD
8797-294123-0079 OUR SOUL STUFF IS NOT A COIN TO BE POCKETED BY THE FIRST CHANCE COMER THE JAPANESE CANNOT POCKET IT ANY MORE THAN HE CAN THRILL TO SHORT SAXON WORDS OR WE CAN THRILL TO CHINESE HIEROGLYPHICS THE LEOPARD CANNOT CHANGE ITS SPOTS NOR CAN THE JAPANESE
8797-294123-0080 NOR CAN WE WE ARE THUMBED BY THE AGES INTO WHAT WE ARE AND BY NO CONSCIOUS INWARD EFFORT CAN WE IN A DAY RETHUMB OURSELVES NOR CAN THE JAPANESE IN A DAY OR A GENERATION RETHUMB HIMSELF IN OUR IMAGE
8797-294123-0081 BACK OF OUR OWN GREAT RACE ADVENTURE BACK OF OUR ROBBERIES BY SEA AND LAND OUR LUSTS AND VIOLENCES AND ALL THE EVIL THINGS WE HAVE DONE THERE IS A CERTAIN INTEGRITY A STERNNESS OF CONSCIENCE A MELANCHOLY RESPONSIBILITY OF LIFE
8797-294123-0082 A SYMPATHY AND COMRADESHIP AND WARM HUMAN FEEL WHICH IS OURS INDUBITABLY OURS AND WHICH WE CANNOT TEACH TO THE ORIENTAL AS WE WOULD TEACH LOGARITHMS OR THE TRAJECTORY OF PROJECTILES
8797-294123-0083 THAT WE HAVE GROPED FOR THE WAY OF RIGHT CONDUCT AND AGONIZED OVER THE SOUL BETOKENS OUR SPIRITUAL ENDOWMENT THOUGH WE HAVE STRAYED OFTEN AND FAR FROM RIGHTEOUSNESS THE VOICES OF THE SEERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RAISED
8797-294123-0084 AND WE HAVE HARKED BACK TO THE BIDDING OF CONSCIENCE THE COLOSSAL FACT OF OUR HISTORY IS THAT WE HAVE MADE THE RELIGION OF JESUS CHRIST OUR RELIGION NO MATTER HOW DARK IN ERROR AND DEED OURS HAS BEEN A HISTORY OF SPIRITUAL STRUGGLE AND ENDEAVOUR
8797-294123-0085 WE ARE PRE EMINENTLY A RELIGIOUS RACE WHICH IS ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING THAT WE ARE A RIGHT SEEKING RACE
8797-294123-0086 IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY HAVE NO SOUL WAS HER ANSWER THIS MUST NOT BE TAKEN TO MEAN THAT THE JAPANESE IS WITHOUT SOUL BUT IT SERVES TO ILLUSTRATE THE ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEIR SOULS AND THIS WOMAN'S SOUL
8797-294123-0087 THERE WAS NO FEEL NO SPEECH NO RECOGNITION THIS WESTERN SOUL DID NOT DREAM THAT THE EASTERN SOUL EXISTED IT WAS SO DIFFERENT SO TOTALLY DIFFERENT RELIGION AS A BATTLE FOR THE RIGHT IN OUR SENSE OF RIGHT
8797-294123-0088 AS A YEARNING AND A STRIFE FOR SPIRITUAL GOOD AND PURITY IS UNKNOWN TO THE JAPANESE MEASURED BY WHAT RELIGION MEANS TO US THE JAPANESE IS A RACE WITHOUT RELIGION YET IT HAS A RELIGION
8797-294123-0089 AS ONE JAPANESE HAS WRITTEN OUR REFLECTION BROUGHT INTO PROMINENCE NOT SO MUCH THE MORAL AS THE NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TO US THE COUNTRY IS MORE THAN LAND AND SOIL FROM WHICH TO MINE GOLD OR REAP GRAIN
8797-294123-0090 IT IS THE SACRED ABODE OF THE GODS THE SPIRIT OF OUR FOREFATHERS TO US THE EMPEROR IS MORE THAN THE ARCH CONSTABLE OF A REICHSSTAAT OR EVEN THE PATRON OF A KULTURSTAAT HE IS THE BODILY REPRESENTATIVE OF HEAVEN ON EARTH
8797-294123-0091 BLENDING IN HIS PERSON ITS POWER AND ITS MERCY THE RELIGION OF JAPAN IS PRACTICALLY A WORSHIP OF THE STATE ITSELF PATRIOTISM IS THE EXPRESSION OF THIS WORSHIP THE JAPANESE MIND DOES NOT SPLIT HAIRS AS TO WHETHER THE EMPEROR IS HEAVEN INCARNATE OR THE STATE INCARNATE
8797-294123-0092 SO FAR AS THE JAPANESE ARE CONCERNED THE EMPEROR LIVES IS HIMSELF DEITY THE EMPEROR IS THE OBJECT TO LIVE FOR AND TO DIE FOR THE JAPANESE IS NOT AN INDIVIDUALIST
8797-294123-0093 HE HAS DEVELOPED NATIONAL CONSCIOUSNESS INSTEAD OF MORAL CONSCIOUSNESS HE IS NOT INTERESTED IN HIS OWN MORAL WELFARE EXCEPT IN SO FAR AS IT IS THE WELFARE OF THE STATE THE HONOUR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PER SE DOES NOT EXIST
8797-294123-0094 ONLY EXISTS THE HONOUR OF THE STATE WHICH IS HIS HONOUR HE DOES NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A FREE AGENT WORKING OUT HIS OWN PERSONAL SALVATION SPIRITUAL AGONIZING IS UNKNOWN TO HIM HE HAS A SENSE OF CALM TRUST IN FATE
8797-294123-0095 A QUIET SUBMISSION TO THE INEVITABLE A STOIC COMPOSURE IN SIGHT OF DANGER OR CALAMITY A DISDAIN OF LIFE AND FRIENDLINESS WITH DEATH HE RELATES HIMSELF TO THE STATE AS AMONGST BEES THE WORKER IS RELATED TO THE HIVE HIMSELF NOTHING
8797-294123-0096 THE STATE EVERYTHING HIS REASONS FOR EXISTENCE THE EXALTATION AND GLORIFICATION OF THE STATE THE MOST ADMIRED QUALITY TO DAY OF THE JAPANESE IS HIS PATRIOTISM
8797-294123-0097 THE WESTERN WORLD IS IN RHAPSODIES OVER IT UNWITTINGLY MEASURING THE JAPANESE PATRIOTISM BY ITS OWN CONCEPTIONS OF PATRIOTISM FOR GOD MY COUNTRY AND THE CZAR CRIES THE RUSSIAN PATRIOT
8797-294123-0098 BUT IN THE JAPANESE MIND THERE IS NO DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN THE THREE THE EMPEROR IS THE EMPEROR AND GOD AND COUNTRY AS WELL THE PATRIOTISM OF THE JAPANESE IS BLIND AND UNSWERVING LOYALTY TO WHAT IS PRACTICALLY AN ABSOLUTISM
8797-294123-0099 THE EMPEROR CAN DO NO WRONG NOR CAN THE FIVE AMBITIOUS GREAT MEN WHO HAVE HIS EAR AND CONTROL THE DESTINY OF JAPAN NO GREAT RACE ADVENTURE CAN GO FAR NOR ENDURE LONG WHICH HAS NO DEEPER FOUNDATION THAN MATERIAL SUCCESS
8797-294123-0100 NO HIGHER PROMPTING THAN CONQUEST FOR CONQUEST'S SAKE AND MERE RACE GLORIFICATION TO GO FAR AND TO ENDURE IT MUST HAVE BEHIND IT AN ETHICAL IMPULSE A SINCERELY CONCEIVED RIGHTEOUSNESS
8797-294123-0101 BUT IT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE ABOVE POSTULATE IS ITSELF A PRODUCT OF WESTERN RACE EGOTISM URGED BY OUR BELIEF IN OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS AND FOSTERED BY A FAITH IN OURSELVES WHICH MAY BE AS ERRONEOUS AS ARE MOST FOND RACE FANCIES
8797-294123-0102 SO BE IT THE WORLD IS WHIRLING FASTER TO DAY THAN EVER BEFORE IT HAS GAINED IMPETUS AFFAIRS RUSH TO CONCLUSION THE FAR EAST IS THE POINT OF CONTACT OF THE ADVENTURING WESTERN PEOPLE AS WELL AS OF THE ASIATIC
8797-294123-0103 WE SHALL NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR OUR CHILDREN'S TIME NOR OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN WE SHALL OURSELVES SEE AND LARGELY DETERMINE THE ADVENTURE OF THE YELLOW AND THE BROWN FENG WANG CHENG MANCHURIA
8838-298545-0000 HE SAT IN SILENCE WITH HIS FINE SHOULDERS BOWED AND HIS HEAD UPON HIS HANDS OUTSIDE THROUGH THE GRIMY SURGERY WINDOW OVER A FOREGROUND OF BLACKENED BRICK AND SLATE A LINE OF ENORMOUS CHIMNEYS LIKE CYCLOPEAN PILLARS
8838-298545-0001 UPHELD THE LOWERING DUN COLOURED CLOUD BANK FOR SIX DAYS IN THE WEEK THEY SPOUTED SMOKE BUT TO DAY THE FURNACE FIRES WERE BANKED FOR IT WAS SUNDAY SORDID AND POLLUTING GLOOM HUNG OVER A DISTRICT BLIGHTED AND BLASTED BY THE GREED OF MAN
8838-298545-0002 HE SHOULD BE BACK AGAIN AT THE UNIVERSITY COMPLETING THE LAST YEAR WHICH WOULD GIVE HIM HIS MEDICAL DEGREE BUT ALAS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY WITH WHICH TO PAY HIS CLASS FEES NOR COULD HE IMAGINE HOW HE COULD PROCURE IT
8838-298545-0003 HE WAS ROUSED FROM HIS BLACK MEDITATION BY THE ENTRANCE OF DOCTOR OLDACRE HIMSELF A LARGE CLEAN SHAVEN RESPECTABLE MAN WITH A PRIM MANNER AND AN AUSTERE FACE HE HAD PROSPERED EXCEEDINGLY BY THE SUPPORT OF THE LOCAL CHURCH INTEREST
8838-298545-0004 AND THE RULE OF HIS LIFE WAS NEVER BY WORD OR ACTION TO RUN A RISK OF OFFENDING THE SENTIMENT WHICH HAD MADE HIM HIS STANDARD OF RESPECTABILITY AND OF DIGNITY WAS EXCEEDINGLY HIGH AND HE EXPECTED THE SAME FROM HIS ASSISTANTS
8838-298545-0005 HIS APPEARANCE AND WORDS WERE ALWAYS VAGUELY BENEVOLENT A SUDDEN IMPULSE CAME OVER THE DESPONDENT STUDENT HE WOULD TEST THE REALITY OF THIS PHILANTHROPY I BEG YOUR PARDON DOCTOR OLDACRE SAID HE RISING FROM HIS CHAIR
8838-298545-0006 I HAVE A GREAT FAVOUR TO ASK OF YOU THE DOCTOR'S APPEARANCE WAS NOT ENCOURAGING HIS MOUTH SUDDENLY TIGHTENED AND HIS EYES FELL YES MISTER MONTGOMERY YOU ARE AWARE SIR THAT I NEED ONLY ONE MORE SESSION TO COMPLETE MY COURSE
8838-298545-0007 I AM AFRAID THAT MY DUTIES CALL ME ELSEWHERE MISTER MONTGOMERY ONE MOMENT SIR I HAD HOPED SIR THAT PERHAPS IF I SIGNED A PAPER PROMISING YOU INTEREST UPON YOUR MONEY YOU WOULD ADVANCE THIS SUM TO ME I WILL PAY YOU BACK SIR I REALLY WILL OR
8838-298545-0008 IF YOU LIKE I WILL WORK IT OFF AFTER I AM QUALIFIED THE DOCTOR'S LIPS HAD THINNED INTO A NARROW LINE HIS EYES WERE RAISED AGAIN AND SPARKLED INDIGNANTLY YOUR REQUEST IS UNREASONABLE MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0009 CONSIDER SIR HOW MANY THOUSANDS OF MEDICAL STUDENTS THERE ARE IN THIS COUNTRY NO DOUBT THERE ARE MANY OF THEM WHO HAVE A DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THEIR FEES AM I TO PROVIDE FOR THEM ALL OR WHY SHOULD I MAKE AN EXCEPTION IN YOUR FAVOUR I AM GRIEVED AND DISAPPOINTED MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0010 THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE PUT ME INTO THE PAINFUL POSITION OF HAVING TO REFUSE YOU HE TURNED UPON HIS HEEL AND WALKED WITH OFFENDED DIGNITY OUT OF THE SURGERY THE STUDENT SMILED BITTERLY AND TURNED TO HIS WORK OF MAKING UP THE MORNING PRESCRIPTIONS
8838-298545-0011 HE ONLY EXCELLED IN HIS STRENGTH AND WHERE WAS HE TO FIND A CUSTOMER FOR THAT BUT THE WAYS OF FATE ARE STRANGE AND HIS CUSTOMER WAS AT HAND LOOK Y'ERE SAID A VOICE AT THE DOOR MONTGOMERY LOOKED UP
8838-298545-0012 FOR THE VOICE WAS A LOUD AND RASPING ONE A YOUNG MAN STOOD AT THE ENTRANCE A STOCKY BULL NECKED YOUNG MINER IN TWEED SUNDAY CLOTHES AND AN AGGRESSIVE NECK TIE HE WAS A SINISTER LOOKING FIGURE WITH DARK INSOLENT EYES
8838-298545-0013 AND THE JAW AND THROAT OF A BULLDOG LOOK Y'ERE SAID HE AGAIN WHY HAST THOU NOT SENT T MEDICINE OOP AS THY MASTER ORDERED MONTGOMERY HAD BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO THE BRUTAL FRANKNESS OF THE NORTHERN WORKER AT FIRST IT HAD ENRAGED HIM
8838-298545-0014 BUT AFTER A TIME HE HAD GROWN CALLOUS TO IT AND ACCEPTED IT AS IT WAS MEANT BUT THIS WAS SOMETHING DIFFERENT IT WAS INSOLENCE BRUTAL OVERBEARING INSOLENCE WITH PHYSICAL MENACE BEHIND IT WHAT NAME HE ASKED COLDLY
8838-298545-0015 THE PROVOCATION WAS SO GROSS THE INSULT SO UNPROVOKED THAT HE COULD HAVE NONE OF THOSE QUALMS WHICH TAKE THE EDGE OFF A MAN'S METTLE HE FINISHED SEALING THE BOTTLE UPON WHICH HE WAS OCCUPIED AND HE ADDRESSED IT AND PLACED IT CAREFULLY IN THE RACK
8838-298545-0016 LOOK HERE SAID HE TURNING ROUND TO THE MINER YOUR MEDICINE WILL BE MADE UP IN ITS TURN AND SENT DOWN TO YOU I DON'T ALLOW FOLK IN THE SURGERY WAIT OUTSIDE IN THE WAITING ROOM IF YOU WISH TO WAIT AT ALL YOONG MAN SAID THE MINER
8838-298545-0017 THE BLOWS WERE ALMOST SIMULTANEOUS A SAVAGE SWING WHICH WHISTLED PAST MONTGOMERY'S EAR AND A STRAIGHT DRIVE WHICH TOOK THE WORKMAN ON THE CHIN LUCK WAS WITH THE ASSISTANT THAT SINGLE WHIZZING UPPERCUT AND THE WAY IN WHICH IT WAS DELIVERED
8838-298545-0018 HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE ASSISTANT BREATHING FIERCELY THROUGH HIS NOSE BUT NO ANSWER CAME THE MAN WAS INSENSIBLE AND THEN THE DANGER OF HIS POSITION CAME UPON MONTGOMERY AND HE TURNED AS WHITE AS HIS ANTAGONIST
8838-298545-0019 A SUNDAY THE IMMACULATE DOCTOR OLDACRE WITH HIS PIOUS CONNECTION A SAVAGE BRAWL WITH A PATIENT HE WOULD IRRETRIEVABLY LOSE HIS SITUATION IF THE FACTS CAME OUT IT WAS NOT MUCH OF A SITUATION BUT HE COULD NOT GET ANOTHER WITHOUT A REFERENCE
8838-298545-0020 LOOSENED HIS COLLAR AND SQUEEZED THE SURGERY SPONGE OVER HIS FACE HE SAT UP AT LAST WITH A GASP AND A SCOWL DOMN THEE THOU'S SPOILT MY NECK TIE SAID HE MOPPING UP THE WATER FROM HIS BREAST
8838-298545-0021 I'M SORRY I HIT YOU SO HARD SAID MONTGOMERY APOLOGETICALLY THOU HIT ME HARD I COULD STAN SUCH FLY FLAPPIN ALL DAY TWAS THIS HERE PRESS THAT CRACKED MY PATE FOR ME AND THOU ART A LOOKY MAN TO BE ABLE TO BOAST AS THOU HAST OUTED ME
8838-298545-0022 AND NOW I'D BE OBLIGED TO THEE IF THOU WILT GIVE ME T WIFE'S MEDICINE MONTGOMERY GLADLY MADE IT UP AND HANDED IT TO THE MINER YOU ARE WEAK STILL SAID HE WON'T YOU STAY AWHILE AND REST T WIFE WANTS HER MEDICINE
8838-298545-0023 SAID THE MAN AND LURCHED OUT AT THE DOOR THE ASSISTANT LOOKING AFTER HIM SAW HIM ROLLING WITH AN UNCERTAIN STEP DOWN THE STREET UNTIL A FRIEND MET HIM AND THEY WALKED ON ARM IN ARM THE MAN SEEMED IN HIS ROUGH NORTHERN FASHION TO BEAR NO GRUDGE
8838-298545-0024 YET ALL DAY HE WAS AWARE OF A SENSE OF VAGUE UNEASINESS WHICH SHARPENED INTO DISMAY WHEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON HE WAS INFORMED THAT THREE GENTLEMEN HAD CALLED AND WERE WAITING FOR HIM IN THE SURGERY A CORONER'S INQUEST
8838-298545-0025 ABOVE ALL WHAT THEY COULD EXPECT FROM HIM WAS A MOST INEXPLICABLE PROBLEM THE FIRST WAS SORLEY WILSON THE SON OF THE OWNER OF THE NONPAREIL COALPIT HE WAS A YOUNG BLOOD OF TWENTY HEIR TO A FORTUNE A KEEN SPORTSMAN
8838-298545-0026 AND DOWN FOR THE EASTER VACATION FROM MAGDALENE COLLEGE HE SAT NOW UPON THE EDGE OF THE SURGERY TABLE LOOKING IN THOUGHTFUL SILENCE AT MONTGOMERY AND TWISTING THE ENDS OF HIS SMALL BLACK WAXED MOUSTACHE THE SECOND WAS PURVIS THE PUBLICAN
8838-298545-0027 AND HE ALSO LEANED FORWARD IN SILENCE FROM HIS CHAIR A FAT RED HAND UPON EITHER KNEE AND STARED CRITICALLY AT THE YOUNG ASSISTANT SO DID THE THIRD VISITOR FAWCETT THE HORSE BREAKER WHO LEANED BACK HIS LONG THIN LEGS WITH THEIR BOXCLOTH RIDING GAITERS
8838-298545-0028 NO IT'S OFF IT'S NOWT STAND OOP LAD LET'S SEE THEE STANDIN IT WAS THE PUBLICAN WHO SPOKE MONTGOMERY OBEYED HE WOULD LEARN ALL ABOUT IT NO DOUBT IF HE WERE PATIENT
8838-298545-0029 A HUNDRED AND THIRTY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY IF HE'S AN OUNCE WELL THE MASTER DOESN'T SCALE MUCH MORE THAN THAT A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS HOG FAT AND LIVING HIGH WORK THE GREASE OUT OF HIM AND I LAY THERE'S NO GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM
8838-298545-0030 HAVE YOU BEEN WEIGHED LATELY MISTER MONTGOMERY IT WAS THE FIRST DIRECT QUESTION WHICH HAD BEEN ASKED HIM HE HAD STOOD IN THE MIDST OF THEM LIKE A HORSE AT A FAIR AND HE WAS JUST BEGINNING TO WONDER WHETHER HE WAS MORE ANGRY OR AMUSED I AM JUST ELEVEN STONE SAID HE
8838-298545-0031 BUT TRAININ FOR EVERYDAY WORK AIN'T THE SAME AS TRAININ WITH A TRAINER AND I DARE BET WITH ALL RESPEC TO YOUR OPINION MISTER WILSON THAT THERE'S HALF A STONE OF TALLOW ON HIM AT THIS MINUTE THE YOUNG CANTAB PUT HIS FINGERS ON THE ASSISTANT'S UPPER ARM
8838-298545-0032 THEN WITH HIS OTHER HAND ON HIS WRIST HE BENT THE FOREARM SHARPLY AND FELT THE BICEPS AS ROUND AND HARD AS A CRICKET BALL SPRING UP UNDER HIS FINGERS FEEL THAT SAID HE THE PUBLICAN AND HORSE BREAKER FELT IT WITH AN AIR OF REVERENCE
8838-298545-0033 GOOD LAD HE'LL DO YET CRIED PURVIS GENTLEMEN SAID MONTGOMERY I THINK THAT YOU WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE BOON VERY PATIENT WITH YOU
8838-298545-0034 AND NOW I MUST REALLY BEG THAT YOU WILL HAVE THE GOODNESS TO TELL ME WHAT IS THE MATTER THEY ALL SAT DOWN IN THEIR SERIOUS BUSINESS LIKE WAY THAT'S EASY DONE MISTER MONTGOMERY SAID THE FAT VOICED PUBLICAN BUT BEFORE SAYIN ANYTHING WE HAD TO WAIT AND SEE WHETHER
8838-298545-0035 FOR IT WOULD BE SOMETHIN NEW TO FIND ISAAC FAWCETT AS A SPOIL SPORT WELL THEN WE WILL MAKE UP THE HUNDRED FOR THE STAKE AMONG US AND THE FIGHT STANDS ALWAYS SUPPOSIN THE YOUNG MAN IS WILLIN EXCUSE ALL THIS ROT MISTER MONTGOMERY
8838-298545-0036 SAID THE UNIVERSITY MAN IN A GENIAL VOICE WE'VE BEGUN AT THE WRONG END I KNOW BUT WE'LL SOON STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
8838-298545-0037 YOU REMEMBER THE MAN WHOM YOU KNOCKED OUT THIS MORNING HE IS BARTON THE FAMOUS TED BARTON I'M SURE SIR YOU MAY WELL BE PROUD TO HAVE OUTED HIM IN ONE ROUND SAID THE PUBLICAN WHY IT TOOK MORRIS THE TEN STONE SIX CHAMPION
8838-298545-0038 A DEAL MORE TROUBLE THAN THAT BEFORE HE PUT BARTON TO SLEEP YOU'VE DONE A FINE PERFORMANCE SIR AND HAPPEN YOU'LL DO A FINER IF YOU GIVE YOURSELF THE CHANCE I NEVER HEARD OF TED BARTON BEYOND SEEING THE NAME ON A MEDICINE LABEL SAID THE ASSISTANT WELL
8838-298545-0039 YOU MAY TAKE IT FROM ME THAT HE'S A SLAUGHTERER SAID THE HORSE BREAKER YOU'VE TAUGHT HIM A LESSON THAT HE NEEDED FOR IT WAS ALWAYS A WORD AND A BLOW WITH HIM AND THE WORD ALONE WAS WORTH FIVE SHILLIN IN A PUBLIC COURT HE WON'T BE SO READY NOW TO SHAKE HIS NIEF IN THE FACE OF EVERYONE HE MEETS
8838-298545-0040 HOWEVER THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE MONTGOMERY LOOKED AT THEM IN BEWILDERMENT FOR GOODNESS SAKE GENTLEMEN TELL ME WHAT IT IS YOU WANT ME TO DO HE CRIED WE WANT YOU TO FIGHT SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298545-0041 BUT WHY BECAUSE TED BARTON WAS TO HAVE FOUGHT HIM NEXT SATURDAY HE WAS THE CHAMPION OF THE WILSON COAL PITS AND THE OTHER WAS THE MASTER OF THE IRON FOLK DOWN AT THE CROXLEY SMELTERS WE'D MATCHED OUR MAN FOR A PURSE OF A HUNDRED AGAINST THE MASTER
8838-298545-0042 BUT YOU'VE QUEERED OUR MAN AND HE CAN'T FACE SUCH A BATTLE WITH A TWO INCH CUT AT THE BACK OF HIS HEAD THERE'S ONLY ONE THING TO BE DONE SIR
8838-298545-0043 IF YOU CAN LICK TED BARTON YOU MAY LICK THE MASTER OF CROXLEY BUT IF YOU DON'T WE'RE DONE FOR THERE'S NO ONE ELSE WHO IS IN THE SAME STREET WITH HIM IN THIS DISTRICT IT'S TWENTY ROUNDS TWO OUNCE GLOVES QUEENSBERRY RULES AND A DECISION ON POINTS IF YOU FIGHT TO THE FINISH
8838-298545-0044 FOR A MOMENT THE ABSURDITY OF THE THING DROVE EVERY OTHER THOUGHT OUT OF MONTGOMERY'S HEAD
8838-298545-0045 ALL HE WANTED TO COMPLETE HIS EDUCATION WAS LYING THERE READY TO HIS HAND IF ONLY THAT HAND WERE STRONG ENOUGH TO PICK IT UP HE HAD THOUGHT BITTERLY THAT MORNING THAT THERE WAS NO MARKET FOR HIS STRENGTH
8838-298545-0046 THAN HIS BRAINS IN A YEAR BUT A CHILL OF DOUBT CAME OVER HIM HOW CAN I FIGHT FOR THE COAL PITS SAID HE I AM NOT CONNECTED WITH THEM EH LAD BUT THOU ART CRIED OLD PURVIS WE'VE GOT IT DOWN IN WRITIN AND IT'S CLEAR ENOUGH
8838-298545-0047 IT WOULD BE A VERY SPORTING THING OF YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY IF YOU WOULD COME TO OUR HELP WHEN WE ARE IN SUCH A HOLE OF COURSE YOU MIGHT NOT LIKE TO TAKE THE HUNDRED POUNDS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE CASE OF YOUR WINNING WE COULD ARRANGE THAT IT SHOULD TAKE THE FORM OF A WATCH OR PIECE OF PLATE
8838-298545-0048 OR ANY OTHER SHAPE WHICH MIGHT SUGGEST ITSELF TO YOU YOU SEE YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HAVING LOST OUR CHAMPION SO WE REALLY FEEL THAT WE HAVE A CLAIM UPON YOU GIVE ME A MOMENT GENTLEMEN IT IS VERY UNEXPECTED
8838-298545-0049 I AM AFRAID THE DOCTOR WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO MY GOING IN FACT I AM SURE THAT HE WOULD NOT BUT HE NEED NEVER KNOW NOT BEFORE THE FIGHT AT ANY RATE WE ARE NOT BOUND TO GIVE THE NAME OF OUR MAN SO LONG AS HE IS WITHIN THE WEIGHT LIMITS ON THE DAY OF THE FIGHT THAT IS ALL THAT CONCERNS ANYONE
8838-298545-0050 THOU'LL RISE IN ONE DAY FROM BEING JUST A COMMON DOCTOR TO THE BEST KNOWN MON TWIXT HERE AND BRADFORD THOU ART A WITHERIN TYKE THOU ART AND NO MISTAKE AND IF THOU BEAT THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL THE BEER THOU WANT FOR THE REST OF THY LIFE WAITING FOR THEE AT THE FOUR SACKS
8838-298545-0051 IT IS THE MOST SPORTING THING I EVER HEARD OF IN MY LIFE SAID YOUNG WILSON BY GEORGE SIR IF YOU PULL IT OFF YOU'VE GOT THE CONSTITUENCY IN YOUR POCKET IF YOU CARE TO STAND YOU KNOW THE OUT HOUSE IN MY GARDEN NEXT THE ROAD EXACTLY
8838-298545-0052 THEN YOU'LL WANT A SPARRING PARTNER OGILVY HAS BEEN ACTING FOR BARTON BUT WE DON'T THINK THAT HE IS CLASS ENOUGH BARTON BEARS YOU NO GRUDGE HE'S A GOOD HEARTED FELLOW THOUGH CROSS GRAINED WITH STRANGERS HE LOOKED UPON YOU AS A STRANGER THIS MORNING BUT HE SAYS HE KNOWS YOU NOW
8838-298546-0000 IT WAS TRUE THAT HIS TEACHER WAS LONG PAST HIS PRIME SLOW UPON HIS FEET AND STIFF IN HIS JOINTS BUT EVEN SO HE WAS STILL A TOUGH ANTAGONIST BUT MONTGOMERY HAD FOUND AT LAST THAT HE COULD MORE THAN HOLD HIS OWN WITH HIM HE HAD WON THE UNIVERSITY MEDAL AND HIS TEACHER
8838-298546-0001 IN WHICH HE HAD THE WORST OF IT BUT HAD MADE THE PRIZE FIGHTER STRETCH HIMSELF TO THE UTTERMOST THERE WAS HIS WHOLE RECORD AND WAS IT ENOUGH TO ENCOURAGE HIM TO STAND UP TO THE MASTER OF CROXLEY HE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE MASTER BEFORE
8838-298546-0002 BUT THEN HE HAD LOST TOUCH OF THE RING DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS OF HARD WORK AFTER ALL WHAT DID IT MATTER IF HE WON THERE WAS THE MONEY WHICH MEANT SO MUCH TO HIM IF HE LOST IT WOULD ONLY MEAN A THRASHING HE COULD TAKE PUNISHMENT WITHOUT FLINCHING OF THAT HE WAS CERTAIN
8838-298546-0003 MATCHED AGAINST A PUGILIST OVER AT CROXLEY I CANNOT UNDERSTAND WHY THE LAW DOES NOT STEP IN AND STOP SO DEGRADING AN EXHIBITION IT IS REALLY A PRIZE FIGHT A GLOVE FIGHT YOU SAID
8838-298546-0004 I AM INFORMED THAT A TWO OZ GLOVE IS AN EVASION BY WHICH THEY DODGE THE LAW AND MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR THE POLICE TO INTERFERE
8838-298546-0005 TO THINK THAT SUCH SCENES CAN BE ENACTED WITHIN A FEW MILES OF OUR PEACEFUL HOME BUT YOU WILL REALISE MISTER MONTGOMERY THAT WHILE THERE ARE SUCH INFLUENCES FOR US TO COUNTERACT IT IS VERY NECESSARY THAT WE SHOULD LIVE UP TO OUR HIGHEST
8838-298546-0006 THE DOCTOR'S SERMON WOULD HAVE HAD MORE EFFECT IF THE ASSISTANT HAD NOT ONCE OR TWICE HAD OCCASION TO TEST HIS HIGHEST AND COME UPON IT AT UNEXPECTEDLY HUMBLE ELEVATIONS IT IS ALWAYS SO PARTICULARLY EASY TO
8838-298546-0007 COMPOUND FOR SINS WE'RE MOST INCLINED TO BY DAMNING THOSE WE HAVE NO MIND TO IN ANY CASE MONTGOMERY FELT THAT OF ALL THE MEN CONCERNED IN SUCH A FIGHT PROMOTERS BACKERS SPECTATORS IT IS THE ACTUAL FIGHTER
8838-298546-0008 WHO HOLDS THE STRONGEST AND MOST HONOURABLE POSITION HIS CONSCIENCE GAVE HIM NO CONCERN UPON THE SUBJECT ENDURANCE AND COURAGE ARE VIRTUES NOT VICES AND BRUTALITY IS AT LEAST BETTER THAN EFFEMINACY
8838-298546-0009 THE ASSISTANT STROLLED DOWN THERE AFTER TEA AND ASKED IN A CASUAL WAY WHETHER THE TOBACCONIST HAD EVER HEARD OF THE MASTER OF CROXLEY
8838-298546-0010 THE LITTLE MAN COULD HARDLY ARTICULATE IN HIS ASTONISHMENT WHY SIR HE'S THE FIRST MON O THE DISTRICT AN HIS NAME'S AS WELL KNOWN IN THE WEST RIDING AS THE WINNER O T DERBY BUT LOR SIR HERE HE STOPPED AND RUMMAGED AMONG A HEAP OF PAPERS
8838-298546-0011 AND SO THE CROXLEY HERALD HAS HIS LIFE AN RECORD AN HERE IT IS AN THOU CANST READ IT FOR THYSEL THE SHEET OF THE PAPER WHICH HE HELD UP WAS A LAKE OF PRINT AROUND AN ISLET OF ILLUSTRATION THE LATTER WAS A COARSE WOOD CUT OF A PUGILIST'S HEAD AND NECK
8838-298546-0012 SILAS CRAGGS AND BENEATH THE MASTER OF CROXLEY THOU'LL FIND ALL ABOUT HIM THERE SIR SAID THE TOBACCONIST HE'S A WITHERIN TYKE HE IS AND WE'RE PROUD TO HAVE HIM IN THE COUNTY IF HE HADN'T BROKE HIS LEG HE'D HAVE BEEN CHAMPION OF ENGLAND
8838-298546-0013 BROKE HIS LEG HAS HE YES AND IT SET BADLY THEY CA HIM OWD K BEHIND HIS BACK FOR THAT IS HOW HIS TWO LEGS LOOK BUT HIS ARMS WELL IF THEY WAS BOTH STROPPED TO A BENCH AS THE SAYIN IS
8838-298546-0014 I'LL TAKE THIS WITH ME SAID MONTGOMERY AND PUTTING THE PAPER INTO HIS POCKET HE RETURNED HOME IT WAS NOT A CHEERING RECORD WHICH HE READ THERE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE CROXLEY MASTER WAS GIVEN IN FULL HIS MANY VICTORIES HIS FEW DEFEATS
8838-298546-0015 BORN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN SAID THE PROVINCIAL BIOGRAPHER SILAS CRAGGS BETTER KNOWN IN SPORTING CIRCLES AS THE MASTER OF CROXLEY IS NOW IN HIS FORTIETH YEAR HANG IT I'M ONLY TWENTY THREE
8838-298546-0016 AND WON THE PROUD TITLE WHICH HE STILL HOLDS AMBITIOUS OF A MORE THAN LOCAL FAME HE SECURED A PATRON AND FOUGHT HIS FIRST FIGHT AGAINST JACK BARTON OF BIRMINGHAM IN MAY EIGHTEEN EIGHTY AT THE OLD LOITERERS CLUB CRAGGS
8838-298546-0017 WHO FOUGHT AT TEN STONE TWO AT THE TIME HAD THE BETTER OF FIFTEEN RATTLING ROUNDS AND GAINED AN AWARD ON POINTS AGAINST THE MIDLANDER HAVING DISPOSED OF JAMES DUNN OF ROTHERHITHE CAMERON OF GLASGOW AND A YOUTH NAMED FERNIE
8838-298546-0018 IT WAS OWING TO THIS THAT HE WAS DEFEATED IN SEVEN ROUNDS BY WILLOX THE MAN WHOM HE HAD PREVIOUSLY BEATEN AND AFTERWARDS BY JAMES SHAW OF LONDON THOUGH THE LATTER ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE HAD FOUND THE TOUGHEST CUSTOMER OF HIS CAREER UNDISMAYED BY HIS REVERSES
8838-298546-0019 THE MASTER ADAPTED THE STYLE OF HIS FIGHTING TO HIS PHYSICAL DISABILITIES AND RESUMED HIS CAREER OF VICTORY DEFEATING NORTON THE BLACK HOBBY WILSON AND LEVI COHEN THE LATTER A HEAVY WEIGHT CONCEDING TWO STONE HE FOUGHT A DRAW WITH THE FAMOUS BILLY MC QUIRE
8838-298546-0020 WHO MAY WISH TO LEARN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A BAR ROOM SCRAMBLE AND A SCIENTIFIC CONTEST THE LATEST OF THESE AMBITIOUS SOULS COMES FROM THE WILSON COAL PITS WHICH HAVE UNDERTAKEN TO PUT UP A STAKE OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AND BACK THEIR LOCAL CHAMPION
8838-298546-0021 THERE ARE VARIOUS RUMOURS AFLOAT AS TO WHO THEIR REPRESENTATIVE IS TO BE THE NAME OF TED BARTON BEING FREELY MENTIONED BUT THE BETTING WHICH IS SEVEN TO ONE ON THE MASTER AGAINST ANY UNTRIED MAN IS A FAIR REFLECTION OF THE FEELING OF THE COMMUNITY
8838-298546-0022 NO LIGHT MATTER THIS WHICH HE HAD UNDERTAKEN NO BATTLE WITH A ROUGH AND TUMBLE FIGHTER WHO PRESUMED UPON A LOCAL REPUTATION THE MAN'S RECORD SHOWED THAT HE WAS FIRST CLASS OR NEARLY SO THERE WERE A FEW POINTS IN HIS FAVOUR AND HE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF THEM
8838-298546-0023 THERE WAS AGE TWENTY THREE AGAINST FORTY THERE WAS AN OLD RING PROVERB THAT YOUTH WILL BE SERVED BUT THE ANNALS OF THE RING OFFER A GREAT NUMBER OF EXCEPTIONS A HARD VETERAN FULL OF COOL VALOUR AND RING CRAFT
8838-298546-0024 COULD GIVE TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND A BEATING TO MOST STRIPLINGS HE COULD NOT RELY TOO MUCH UPON HIS ADVANTAGE IN AGE BUT THEN THERE WAS THE LAMENESS THAT MUST SURELY COUNT FOR A GREAT DEAL AND LASTLY THERE WAS THE CHANCE THAT THE MASTER MIGHT UNDERRATE HIS OPPONENT
8838-298546-0025 THAT HE MIGHT BE REMISS IN HIS TRAINING AND REFUSE TO ABANDON HIS USUAL WAY OF LIFE IF HE THOUGHT THAT HE HAD AN EASY TASK BEFORE HIM IN A MAN OF HIS AGE AND HABITS THIS SEEMED VERY POSSIBLE MONTGOMERY PRAYED THAT IT MIGHT BE SO
8838-298546-0026 MEANWHILE IF HIS OPPONENT WERE THE BEST MAN WHO EVER JUMPED THE ROPES INTO A RING HIS OWN DUTY WAS CLEAR HE MUST PREPARE HIMSELF CAREFULLY THROW AWAY NO CHANCE AND DO THE VERY BEST THAT HE COULD BUT HE KNEW ENOUGH TO APPRECIATE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH EXISTS IN BOXING AS IN EVERY SPORT
8838-298546-0027 BETWEEN THE AMATEUR AND THE PROFESSIONAL THE COOLNESS THE POWER OF HITTING ABOVE ALL THE CAPABILITY OF TAKING PUNISHMENT COUNT FOR SO MUCH THOSE SPECIALLY DEVELOPED GUTTA PERCHA LIKE ABDOMINAL MUSCLES OF THE HARDENED PUGILIST
8838-298546-0028 WILL TAKE WITHOUT FLINCHING A BLOW WHICH WOULD LEAVE ANOTHER MAN WRITHING ON THE GROUND SUCH THINGS ARE NOT TO BE ACQUIRED IN A WEEK BUT ALL THAT COULD BE DONE IN A WEEK SHOULD BE DONE THE MEDICAL ASSISTANT HAD A GOOD BASIS TO START FROM
8838-298546-0029 TALL ENOUGH FOR ANYTHING ON TWO LEGS AS THE OLD RING MEN USED TO SAY LITHE AND SPARE WITH THE ACTIVITY OF A PANTHER AND A STRENGTH WHICH HAD HARDLY YET EVER FOUND ITS LIMITATIONS HIS MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT WAS FINELY HARD
8838-298546-0030 BUT AS THE VISITING WAS DONE ON FOOT AND CONSIDERABLE DISTANCES HAD TO BE TRAVERSED IT WAS A TRAINING IN ITSELF FOR THE REST HE PUNCHED THE SWINGING BALL AND WORKED WITH THE DUMB BELLS FOR AN HOUR EVERY MORNING AND EVENING AND BOXED TWICE A DAY WITH TED BARTON IN THE GYMNASIUM
8838-298546-0031 GAINING AS MUCH PROFIT AS COULD BE GOT FROM A RUSHING TWO HANDED SLOGGER BARTON WAS FULL OF ADMIRATION FOR HIS CLEVERNESS AND QUICKNESS BUT DOUBTFUL ABOUT HIS STRENGTH HARD HITTING WAS THE FEATURE OF HIS OWN STYLE AND HE EXACTED IT FROM OTHERS
8838-298546-0032 ALL THOT'S BETTER MON THOT'S FINE HE WOULD ADD AS HIS OPPONENT LIFTED HIM ACROSS THE ROOM ON THE END OF A RIGHT COUNTER THOT'S HOW I LIKES TO FEEL EM HAPPEN THOU'LT PULL THROUGH YET HE CHUCKLED WITH JOY WHEN MONTGOMERY KNOCKED HIM INTO A CORNER
8838-298546-0033 THESE CAUSELESS WHIMS AND FANCIES ARE VERY MUCH TO BE DEPRECATED MISTER MONTGOMERY CONSIDER HOW MANY THERE ARE TO WHOM THESE VERY POTATOES AND THIS VERY BEER WOULD BE MOST ACCEPTABLE NO DOUBT SIR BUT AT PRESENT I PREFER TO DO WITHOUT THEM
8838-298546-0034 I SHOULD DO A DOUBLE DAY'S WORK ON FRIDAY SO AS TO LEAVE EVERYTHING IN ORDER I SHOULD HOPE TO BE BACK IN THE EVENING I AM AFRAID I CANNOT SPARE YOU MISTER MONTGOMERY THIS WAS A FACER IF HE COULD NOT GET LEAVE HE WOULD GO WITHOUT IT
8838-298546-0035 YOU WILL REMEMBER DOCTOR OLDACRE THAT WHEN I CAME TO YOU IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT I SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR DAY EVERY MONTH I HAVE NEVER CLAIMED ONE BUT NOW THERE ARE REASONS WHY I WISH TO HAVE A HOLIDAY UPON SATURDAY DOCTOR OLDACRE GAVE IN WITH A VERY BAD GRACE
8838-298546-0036 OF COURSE IF YOU INSIST UPON YOUR FORMAL RIGHTS THERE IS NO MORE TO BE SAID MISTER MONTGOMERY THOUGH I FEEL THAT IT SHOWS A CERTAIN INDIFFERENCE TO MY COMFORT AND THE WELFARE OF THE PRACTICE DO YOU STILL INSIST YES SIR VERY GOOD HAVE YOUR WAY
8838-298546-0037 A QUIET RESOLUTION IN HIS VOICE AS HE CLAIMED HIS SATURDAY WHICH AROUSED HIS CURIOSITY I HAVE NO DESIRE TO INTERFERE UNDULY WITH YOUR AFFAIRS MISTER MONTGOMERY BUT WERE YOU THINKING OF HAVING A DAY IN LEEDS UPON SATURDAY NO SIR
8838-298546-0038 IN THE COUNTRY YES SIR YOU ARE VERY WISE YOU WILL FIND A QUIET DAY AMONG THE WILD FLOWERS A VERY VALUABLE RESTORATIVE HAVE YOU THOUGHT OF ANY PARTICULAR DIRECTION I AM GOING OVER CROXLEY WAY
8838-298546-0039 A VERY INTERESTING RELIC OF THE EARLY NORMAN ERA BY THE WAY THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH I SEE TO YOUR GOING TO CROXLEY ON SATURDAY IT IS UPON THAT DATE AS I AM INFORMED THAT THAT RUFFIANLY GLOVE FIGHT TAKES PLACE
8838-298546-0040 YOU MAY FIND YOURSELF MOLESTED BY THE BLACKGUARDS WHOM IT WILL ATTRACT I WILL TAKE MY CHANCE OF THAT SIR SAID THE ASSISTANT ON THE FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH WAS THE LAST NIGHT BEFORE THE FIGHT
8838-298546-0041 HE'S SIMPLY RIPPING SAID THE UNDERGRADUATE
8838-298546-0042 THAT'S ONLY THREE PUND OFF IN A WEEK'S TRAININ SAID THE HORSE BREAKER HE SAID RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THAT HE WAS IN CONDITION WELL IT'S FINE STUFF ALL THERE IS OF IT BUT I'M NONE SO SURE AS THERE IS ENOUGH
8838-298546-0043 HE KEPT POKING HIS FINGER INTO MONTGOMERY AS IF HE WERE ONE OF HIS HORSES I HEAR THAT THE MASTER WILL SCALE A HUNDRED AND SIXTY ODD AT THE RING SIDE BUT THERE'S SOME OF THAT WHICH HE'D LIKE WELL TO PULL OFF AND LEAVE BEHIND WI HIS SHIRT SAID PURVIS
8838-298546-0044 I HEAR THEY'VE HAD A RARE JOB TO GET HIM TO DROP HIS BEER AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THAT GREAT RED HEADED WENCH OF HIS
8838-298546-0045 SHE FAIR SCRATTED THE FACE OFF A POTMAN THAT HAD BROUGHT HIM A GALLON FROM T CHEQUERS THEY SAY THE HUSSY IS HIS SPARRIN PARTNER AS WELL AS HIS SWEETHEART AND THAT HIS POOR WIFE IS JUST BREAKIN HER HEART OVER IT HULLO YOUNG UN WHAT DO YOU WANT
8838-298546-0046 THE DOOR OF THE GYMNASIUM HAD OPENED AND A LAD ABOUT SIXTEEN GRIMY AND BLACK WITH SOOT AND IRON STEPPED INTO THE YELLOW GLARE OF THE OIL LAMP TED BARTON SEIZED HIM BY THE COLLAR
8838-298546-0047 SEE HERE THOU YOONG WHELP THIS IS PRIVATE AND WE WANT NOAN O THY SPYIN BUT I MAUN SPEAK TO MISTER WILSON THE YOUNG CANTAB STEPPED FORWARD WELL MY LAD WHAT IS IT

8838-298546-0053 I DO IT FOR LOVE SUGGESTED THE PUBLICAN FOR HATE SAID THE BOY AND DARTED OFF INTO THE DARKNESS SEEMS TO ME T RED HEADED WENCH MAY DO HIM MORE HARM THAN GOOD AFTER ALL REMARKED THE PUBLICAN
887-123289-0000 WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE RAFT WAS DASHED UPON THE ROCKS IS MORE THAN I CAN TELL I FELT MYSELF HURLED INTO THE WAVES AND IF I ESCAPED FROM DEATH AND IF MY BODY WAS NOT TORN OVER THE SHARP EDGES OF THE ROCKS
887-123289-0001 IT WAS BECAUSE THE POWERFUL ARM OF HANS CAME TO MY RESCUE THE BRAVE ICELANDER CARRIED ME OUT OF THE REACH OF THE WAVES OVER A BURNING SAND WHERE I FOUND MYSELF BY THE SIDE OF MY UNCLE
887-123289-0002 THEN HE RETURNED TO THE ROCKS AGAINST WHICH THE FURIOUS WAVES WERE BEATING TO SAVE WHAT HE COULD I WAS UNABLE TO SPEAK I WAS SHATTERED WITH FATIGUE AND EXCITEMENT
887-123289-0003 I WANTED A WHOLE HOUR TO RECOVER EVEN A LITTLE BUT A DELUGE OF RAIN WAS STILL FALLING THOUGH WITH THAT VIOLENCE WHICH GENERALLY DENOTES THE NEAR CESSATION OF A STORM
887-123289-0004 THE NEXT DAY THE WEATHER WAS SPLENDID THE SKY AND THE SEA HAD SUNK INTO SUDDEN REPOSE EVERY TRACE OF THE AWFUL STORM HAD DISAPPEARED
887-123289-0005 THE EXHILARATING VOICE OF THE PROFESSOR FELL UPON MY EARS AS I AWOKE HE WAS OMINOUSLY CHEERFUL WELL MY BOY HE CRIED HAVE YOU SLEPT WELL
887-123289-0006 AND THAT I WAS ONLY JUST COMING DOWN TO BREAKFAST AND THAT I WAS TO BE MARRIED TO GRAEUBEN THAT DAY ALAS IF THE TEMPEST HAD BUT SENT THE RAFT A LITTLE MORE EAST WE SHOULD HAVE PASSED UNDER GERMANY UNDER MY BELOVED TOWN OF HAMBURG
887-123289-0007 UNDER THE VERY STREET WHERE DWELT ALL THAT I LOVED MOST IN THE WORLD THEN ONLY FORTY LEAGUES WOULD HAVE SEPARATED US BUT THEY WERE FORTY LEAGUES PERPENDICULAR OF SOLID GRANITE WALL AND IN REALITY WE WERE A THOUSAND LEAGUES ASUNDER
887-123289-0008 ALL THESE PAINFUL REFLECTIONS RAPIDLY CROSSED MY MIND BEFORE I COULD ANSWER MY UNCLE'S QUESTION WELL NOW HE REPEATED WON'T YOU TELL ME HOW YOU HAVE SLEPT OH VERY WELL I SAID
887-123289-0009 I AM ONLY A LITTLE KNOCKED UP BUT I SHALL SOON BE BETTER OH SAYS MY UNCLE THAT'S NOTHING TO SIGNIFY YOU ARE ONLY A LITTLE BIT TIRED BUT YOU UNCLE YOU SEEM IN VERY GOOD SPIRITS THIS MORNING
887-123289-0010 BUT MY DEAR UNCLE DO LET ME ASK YOU ONE QUESTION OF COURSE AXEL HOW ABOUT RETURNING RETURNING WHY YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT THE RETURN BEFORE THE ARRIVAL NO
887-123289-0011 I ONLY WANT TO KNOW HOW THAT IS TO BE MANAGED IN THE SIMPLEST WAY POSSIBLE WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE OF THE GLOBE EITHER WE SHALL FIND SOME NEW WAY TO GET BACK OR WE SHALL COME BACK LIKE DECENT FOLKS THE WAY WE CAME
887-123289-0012 I FEEL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT THAT IT IS SURE NOT TO BE SHUT AGAINST US BUT THEN WE SHALL HAVE TO REFIT THE RAFT OF COURSE THEN AS TO PROVISIONS HAVE WE ENOUGH TO LAST
887-123289-0013 YES TO BE SURE WE HAVE HANS IS A CLEVER FELLOW AND I AM SURE HE MUST HAVE SAVED A LARGE PART OF OUR CARGO BUT STILL LET US GO AND MAKE SURE
887-123289-0014 WE LEFT THIS GROTTO WHICH LAY OPEN TO EVERY WIND AT THE SAME TIME I CHERISHED A TREMBLING HOPE WHICH WAS A FEAR AS WELL IT SEEMED TO ME IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE TERRIBLE WRECK OF THE RAFT SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED EVERYTHING ON BOARD
887-123289-0015 ON MY ARRIVAL ON THE SHORE I FOUND HANS SURROUNDED BY AN ASSEMBLAGE OF ARTICLES ALL ARRANGED IN GOOD ORDER MY UNCLE SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM WITH A LIVELY GRATITUDE THIS MAN WITH ALMOST SUPERHUMAN DEVOTION
887-123289-0016 AND HAD SAVED THE MOST PRECIOUS OF THE ARTICLES AT THE RISK OF HIS LIFE NOT THAT WE HAD SUFFERED NO LOSSES FOR INSTANCE OUR FIREARMS BUT WE MIGHT DO WITHOUT THEM OUR STOCK OF POWDER HAD REMAINED UNINJURED
887-123289-0017 AFTER HAVING RISKED BLOWING UP DURING THE STORM WELL CRIED THE PROFESSOR AS WE HAVE NO GUNS WE CANNOT HUNT THAT'S ALL YES BUT HOW ABOUT THE INSTRUMENTS HERE IS THE ANEROID THE MOST USEFUL OF ALL
887-123289-0018 AND FOR WHICH I WOULD HAVE GIVEN ALL THE OTHERS BY MEANS OF IT I CAN CALCULATE THE DEPTH AND KNOW WHEN WE HAVE REACHED THE CENTRE WITHOUT IT
887-123289-0019 SUCH HIGH SPIRITS AS THESE WERE RATHER TOO STRONG BUT WHERE IS THE COMPASS I ASKED HERE IT IS UPON THIS ROCK IN PERFECT CONDITION AS WELL AS THE THERMOMETERS AND THE CHRONOMETER THE HUNTER IS A SPLENDID FELLOW
887-123289-0020 THERE WAS NO DENYING IT WE HAD ALL OUR INSTRUMENTS AS FOR TOOLS AND APPLIANCES THERE THEY ALL LAY ON THE GROUND LADDERS ROPES PICKS SPADES ET CETERA STILL THERE WAS THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONS TO BE SETTLED AND I ASKED
887-123289-0021 HOW ARE WE OFF FOR PROVISIONS THE BOXES CONTAINING THESE WERE IN A LINE UPON THE SHORE IN A PERFECT STATE OF PRESERVATION FOR THE MOST PART THE SEA HAD SPARED THEM AND WHAT WITH BISCUITS SALT MEAT SPIRITS AND SALT FISH
887-123289-0022 FOUR MONTHS CRIED THE PROFESSOR WE HAVE TIME TO GO AND TO RETURN
887-123289-0023 I OUGHT BY THIS TIME TO HAVE BEEN QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO MY UNCLE'S WAYS YET THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING FRESH ABOUT HIM TO ASTONISH ME NOW SAID HE
887-123289-0024 THEREFORE WE SHALL HAVE NO REASON TO FEAR ANYTHING FROM THIRST AS FOR THE RAFT I WILL RECOMMEND HANS TO DO HIS BEST TO REPAIR IT ALTHOUGH I DON'T EXPECT IT WILL BE OF ANY FURTHER USE TO US HOW SO I CRIED AN IDEA OF MY OWN MY LAD
887-123289-0025 I DON'T THINK WE SHALL COME OUT BY THE WAY THAT WE WENT IN I STARED AT THE PROFESSOR WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MISTRUST I ASKED WAS HE NOT TOUCHED IN THE BRAIN AND YET THERE WAS METHOD IN HIS MADNESS AND NOW LET US GO TO BREAKFAST SAID HE
887-123289-0026 I FOLLOWED HIM TO A HEADLAND AFTER HE HAD GIVEN HIS INSTRUCTIONS TO THE HUNTER THERE PRESERVED MEAT BISCUIT AND TEA MADE US AN EXCELLENT MEAL ONE OF THE BEST I EVER REMEMBER HUNGER THE FRESH AIR THE CALM QUIET WEATHER
887-123289-0027 AFTER THE COMMOTIONS WE HAD GONE THROUGH ALL CONTRIBUTED TO GIVE ME A GOOD APPETITE WHILST BREAKFASTING I TOOK THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT TO MY UNCLE THE QUESTION WHERE WE WERE NOW THAT SEEMS TO ME I SAID RATHER DIFFICULT TO MAKE OUT
887-123289-0028 YES IT IS DIFFICULT HE SAID TO CALCULATE EXACTLY PERHAPS EVEN IMPOSSIBLE SINCE DURING THESE THREE STORMY DAYS I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO KEEP ANY ACCOUNT OF THE RATE OR DIRECTION OF THE RAFT BUT STILL WE MAY GET AN APPROXIMATION
887-123289-0029 THE LAST OBSERVATION I REMARKED WAS MADE ON THE ISLAND WHEN THE GEYSER WAS YOU MEAN AXEL ISLAND DON'T DECLINE THE HONOUR OF HAVING GIVEN YOUR NAME TO THE FIRST ISLAND EVER DISCOVERED IN THE CENTRAL PARTS OF THE GLOBE WELL SAID I
887-123289-0030 LET IT BE AXEL ISLAND THEN WE HAD CLEARED TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY LEAGUES OF SEA AND WE WERE SIX HUNDRED LEAGUES FROM ICELAND VERY WELL ANSWERED MY UNCLE LET US START FROM THAT POINT AND COUNT FOUR DAYS STORM
887-123289-0031 SURELY AXEL IT MAY VIE IN SIZE WITH THE MEDITERRANEAN ITSELF ESPECIALLY I REPLIED IF IT HAPPENS THAT WE HAVE ONLY CROSSED IT IN ITS NARROWEST PART AND IT IS A CURIOUS CIRCUMSTANCE I ADDED THAT IF MY COMPUTATIONS ARE RIGHT
887-123289-0032 THAT IS A GOOD LONG WAY MY FRIEND BUT WHETHER WE ARE UNDER TURKEY OR THE ATLANTIC DEPENDS VERY MUCH UPON THE QUESTION
887-123289-0033 PERHAPS WE HAVE DEVIATED NO I THINK NOT
887-123289-0034 WELL REPLIED MY UNCLE WE MAY EASILY ASCERTAIN THIS BY CONSULTING THE COMPASS LET US GO AND SEE WHAT IT SAYS THE PROFESSOR MOVED TOWARDS THE ROCK UPON WHICH HANS HAD LAID DOWN THE INSTRUMENTS
887-123289-0035 HE WAS GAY AND FULL OF SPIRITS HE RUBBED HIS HANDS HE STUDIED HIS ATTITUDES I FOLLOWED HIM CURIOUS TO KNOW IF I WAS RIGHT IN MY ESTIMATE AS SOON AS WE HAD ARRIVED AT THE ROCK MY UNCLE TOOK THE COMPASS LAID IT HORIZONTALLY
887-123289-0036 AND QUESTIONED THE NEEDLE WHICH AFTER A FEW OSCILLATIONS PRESENTLY ASSUMED A FIXED POSITION MY UNCLE LOOKED AND LOOKED AND LOOKED AGAIN HE RUBBED HIS EYES
887-123289-0037 AND THEN TURNED TO ME THUNDERSTRUCK WITH SOME UNEXPECTED DISCOVERY WHAT IS THE MATTER I ASKED
887-123289-0038 AN EXCLAMATION OF ASTONISHMENT BURST FROM ME THE NORTH POLE OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED TO WHAT WE SUPPOSED TO BE THE SOUTH IT POINTED TO THE SHORE INSTEAD OF TO THE OPEN SEA I SHOOK THE BOX EXAMINED IT AGAIN
887-123289-0039 IT WAS IN PERFECT CONDITION IN WHATEVER POSITION I PLACED THE BOX THE NEEDLE PERTINACIOUSLY RETURNED TO THIS UNEXPECTED QUARTER
887-123290-0000 WE HAD GONE BACKWARDS INSTEAD OF FORWARDS BUT MY UNCLE RAPIDLY RECOVERED HIMSELF AHA WILL FATE PLAY TRICKS UPON ME WILL THE ELEMENTS LAY PLOTS AGAINST ME
887-123290-0001 SHALL FIRE AIR AND WATER MAKE A COMBINED ATTACK AGAINST ME WELL THEY SHALL KNOW WHAT A DETERMINED MAN CAN DO I WILL NOT YIELD I WILL NOT STIR A SINGLE FOOT BACKWARDS AND IT WILL BE SEEN WHETHER MAN OR NATURE IS TO HAVE THE UPPER HAND
887-123290-0002 ERECT UPON THE ROCK ANGRY AND THREATENING OTTO LIEDENBROCK WAS A RATHER GROTESQUE FIERCE PARODY UPON THE FIERCE ACHILLES DEFYING THE LIGHTNING BUT I THOUGHT IT MY DUTY TO INTERPOSE AND ATTEMPT TO LAY SOME RESTRAINT UPON THIS UNMEASURED FANATICISM
887-123290-0003 JUST LISTEN TO ME I SAID FIRMLY AMBITION MUST HAVE A LIMIT SOMEWHERE WE CANNOT PERFORM IMPOSSIBILITIES WE ARE NOT AT ALL FIT FOR ANOTHER SEA VOYAGE WHO WOULD DREAM OF UNDERTAKING A VOYAGE OF FIVE HUNDRED LEAGUES UPON A HEAP OF ROTTEN PLANKS
887-123290-0004 WITH A BLANKET IN RAGS FOR A SAIL A STICK FOR A MAST AND FIERCE WINDS IN OUR TEETH WE CANNOT STEER WE SHALL BE BUFFETED BY THE TEMPESTS AND WE SHOULD BE FOOLS AND MADMEN TO ATTEMPT TO CROSS A SECOND TIME
887-123290-0005 I WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP THIS SERIES OF UNANSWERABLE REASONS FOR TEN MINUTES WITHOUT INTERRUPTION NOT THAT THE PROFESSOR WAS PAYING ANY RESPECTFUL ATTENTION TO HIS NEPHEW'S ARGUMENTS BUT BECAUSE HE WAS DEAF TO ALL MY ELOQUENCE
887-123290-0006 TO THE RAFT HE SHOUTED SUCH WAS HIS ONLY REPLY IT WAS NO USE FOR ME TO ENTREAT SUPPLICATE GET ANGRY OR DO ANYTHING ELSE IN THE WAY OF OPPOSITION
887-123290-0007 HANS WAS FINISHING THE REPAIRS OF THE RAFT ONE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT THAT THIS STRANGE BEING WAS GUESSING AT MY UNCLE'S INTENTIONS WITH A FEW MORE PIECES OF SURTURBRAND HE HAD REFITTED OUR VESSEL
887-123290-0008 A SAIL ALREADY HUNG FROM THE NEW MAST AND THE WIND WAS PLAYING IN ITS WAVING FOLDS THE PROFESSOR SAID A FEW WORDS TO THE GUIDE AND IMMEDIATELY HE PUT EVERYTHING ON BOARD AND ARRANGED EVERY NECESSARY FOR OUR DEPARTURE
887-123290-0009 THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND THE NORTH WEST WIND BLEW STEADILY WHAT COULD I DO COULD I STAND AGAINST THE TWO IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IF HANS HAD BUT TAKEN MY SIDE BUT NO IT WAS NOT TO BE
887-123290-0010 THE ICELANDER SEEMED TO HAVE RENOUNCED ALL WILL OF HIS OWN AND MADE A VOW TO FORGET AND DENY HIMSELF I COULD GET NOTHING OUT OF A SERVANT SO FEUDALISED AS IT WERE TO HIS MASTER MY ONLY COURSE WAS TO PROCEED
887-123290-0011 I WAS THEREFORE GOING WITH AS MUCH RESIGNATION AS I COULD FIND TO RESUME MY ACCUSTOMED PLACE ON THE RAFT WHEN MY UNCLE LAID HIS HAND UPON MY SHOULDER WE SHALL NOT SAIL UNTIL TO MORROW HE SAID
887-123290-0012 I WILL NOT LEAVE IT UNTIL I HAVE EXAMINED IT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT FOLLOWED IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT
887-123290-0013 WE WERE NOT REALLY WHERE THE PROFESSOR SUPPOSED WE WERE IN FACT WE WERE NOT UPON THE NORTH SHORE OF THE SEA NOW LET US START UPON FRESH DISCOVERIES I SAID AND LEAVING HANS TO HIS WORK WE STARTED OFF TOGETHER
887-123290-0014 THE SPACE BETWEEN THE WATER AND THE FOOT OF THE CLIFFS WAS CONSIDERABLE IT TOOK HALF AN HOUR TO BRING US TO THE WALL OF ROCK WE TRAMPLED UNDER OUR FEET NUMBERLESS SHELLS OF ALL THE FORMS AND SIZES WHICH EXISTED IN THE EARLIEST AGES OF THE WORLD
887-123290-0015 I ALSO SAW IMMENSE CARAPACES MORE THAN FIFTEEN FEET IN DIAMETER
887-123290-0016 AND RIDGED UP IN SUCCESSIVE LINES I WAS THEREFORE LED TO THE CONCLUSION THAT AT ONE TIME THE SEA MUST HAVE COVERED THE GROUND ON WHICH WE WERE TREADING ON THE LOOSE AND SCATTERED ROCKS
887-123290-0017 THE WAVES HAD LEFT MANIFEST TRACES OF THEIR POWER TO WEAR THEIR WAY IN THE HARDEST STONE THIS MIGHT UP TO A CERTAIN POINT EXPLAIN THE EXISTENCE OF AN OCEAN FORTY LEAGUES BENEATH THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE BUT IN MY OPINION
887-123290-0018 THIS LIQUID MASS WOULD BE LOST BY DEGREES FARTHER AND FARTHER WITHIN THE INTERIOR OF THE EARTH AND IT CERTAINLY HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE WATERS OF THE OCEAN OVERHEAD WHICH HAD MADE THEIR WAY HITHER THROUGH SOME FISSURE YET
887-123290-0019 IT MUST BE BELIEVED THAT THAT FISSURE IS NOW CLOSED AND THAT ALL THIS CAVERN OR IMMENSE RESERVOIR WAS FILLED IN A VERY SHORT TIME PERHAPS EVEN THIS WATER SUBJECTED TO THE FIERCE ACTION OF CENTRAL HEAT HAD PARTLY BEEN RESOLVED INTO VAPOUR
887-123290-0020 AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THAT ELECTRICITY WHICH RAISED SUCH TEMPESTS WITHIN THE BOWELS OF THE EARTH THIS THEORY OF THE PHENOMENA WE HAD WITNESSED SEEMED SATISFACTORY TO ME FOR HOWEVER GREAT AND STUPENDOUS THE PHENOMENA OF NATURE
887-123290-0021 FIXED PHYSICAL LAWS WILL OR MAY ALWAYS EXPLAIN THEM WE WERE THEREFORE WALKING UPON SEDIMENTARY SOIL THE DEPOSITS OF THE WATERS OF FORMER AGES THE PROFESSOR WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINING EVERY LITTLE FISSURE IN THE ROCKS
887-123290-0022 WHEREVER HE SAW A HOLE HE ALWAYS WANTED TO KNOW THE DEPTH OF IT TO HIM THIS WAS IMPORTANT WE HAD TRAVERSED THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA FOR A MILE WHEN WE OBSERVED A SUDDEN CHANGE IN THE APPEARANCE OF THE SOIL IT SEEMED UPSET CONTORTED
887-123290-0023 WHERE THE REMAINS OF TWENTY AGES MINGLED THEIR DUST TOGETHER HUGE MOUNDS OF BONY FRAGMENTS ROSE STAGE AFTER STAGE IN THE DISTANCE THEY UNDULATED AWAY TO THE LIMITS OF THE HORIZON AND MELTED IN THE DISTANCE IN A FAINT
887-123290-0024 HAZE THERE WITHIN THREE SQUARE MILES WERE ACCUMULATED THE MATERIALS FOR A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THE ANIMAL LIFE OF AGES A HISTORY SCARCELY OUTLINED IN THE TOO RECENT STRATA OF THE INHABITED WORLD
887-123290-0025 BUT AN IMPATIENT CURIOSITY IMPELLED OUR STEPS CRACKLING AND RATTLING OUR FEET WERE TRAMPLING ON THE REMAINS OF PREHISTORIC ANIMALS AND INTERESTING FOSSILS THE POSSESSION OF WHICH IS A MATTER OF RIVALRY AND CONTENTION
887-123290-0026 A THOUSAND CUVIERS COULD NEVER HAVE RECONSTRUCTED THE ORGANIC REMAINS DEPOSITED IN THIS MAGNIFICENT AND UNPARALLELED COLLECTION I STOOD AMAZED MY UNCLE HAD UPLIFTED HIS LONG ARMS TO THE VAULT WHICH WAS OUR SKY
887-123290-0027 HIS MOUTH GAPING WIDE HIS EYES FLASHING BEHIND HIS SHINING SPECTACLES HIS HEAD BALANCING WITH AN UP AND DOWN MOTION HIS WHOLE ATTITUDE DENOTED UNLIMITED ASTONISHMENT HERE HE STOOD FACING AN IMMENSE COLLECTION OF SCATTERED
887-123290-0028 LEPTOTHERIA MERICOTHERIA LOPHIODIA ANOPLOTHERIA MEGATHERIA MASTODONS PROTOPITHECAE PTERODACTYLES AND ALL SORTS OF EXTINCT MONSTERS HERE ASSEMBLED TOGETHER FOR HIS SPECIAL SATISFACTION
887-123290-0029 FANCY AN ENTHUSIASTIC BIBLIOMANIAC SUDDENLY BROUGHT INTO THE MIDST OF THE FAMOUS ALEXANDRIAN LIBRARY BURNT BY OMAR AND RESTORED BY A MIRACLE FROM ITS ASHES JUST SUCH A CRAZED ENTHUSIAST WAS MY UNCLE PROFESSOR LIEDENBROCK
887-123290-0030 BUT MORE WAS TO COME WHEN
887-123290-0031 HE LAID HIS HAND UPON A BARE SKULL AND CRIED WITH A VOICE TREMBLING WITH EXCITEMENT AXEL AXEL A HUMAN HEAD A HUMAN SKULL I CRIED NO LESS ASTONISHED
887-123291-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT THE PROFESSOR IN HIS CHAIR AGAIN TO UNDERSTAND THIS APOSTROPHE OF MY UNCLE'S MADE TO ABSENT FRENCH SAVANTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO ALLUDE TO AN EVENT OF HIGH IMPORTANCE
887-123291-0001 IN A PALAEONTOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW WHICH HAD OCCURRED A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE OUR DEPARTURE ON THE TWENTY EIGHTH OF MARCH EIGHTEEN SIXTY THREE
887-123291-0002 NEAR ABBEVILLE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF SOMME FOUND A HUMAN JAWBONE FOURTEEN FEET BENEATH THE SURFACE IT WAS THE FIRST FOSSIL OF THIS NATURE THAT HAD EVER BEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT NOT FAR DISTANT
887-123291-0003 WERE FOUND STONE HATCHETS AND FLINT ARROW HEADS STAINED AND ENCASED BY LAPSE OF TIME WITH A UNIFORM COAT OF RUST THE NOISE OF THIS DISCOVERY WAS VERY GREAT NOT IN FRANCE ALONE BUT IN ENGLAND AND IN GERMANY
887-123291-0004 SAW AT ONCE THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS DISCOVERY PROVED TO DEMONSTRATION THE GENUINENESS OF THE BONE IN QUESTION AND BECAME THE MOST ARDENT DEFENDANTS IN WHAT THE ENGLISH CALLED THIS TRIAL OF A JAWBONE
887-123291-0005 THEREFORE THE GENUINENESS OF A FOSSIL HUMAN RELIC OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BE INCONTESTABLY PROVED AND ADMITTED IT IS TRUE THAT THIS THEORY MET WITH A MOST OBSTINATE OPPONENT
887-123291-0006 AND AGREEING IN THAT WITH CUVIER HE REFUSED TO ADMIT THAT THE HUMAN SPECIES COULD BE CONTEMPORARY WITH THE ANIMALS OF THE QUATERNARY PERIOD MY UNCLE LIEDENBROCK ALONG WITH THE GREAT BODY OF THE GEOLOGISTS HAD MAINTAINED HIS GROUND DISPUTED AND ARGUED UNTIL
887-123291-0007 WE KNEW ALL THESE DETAILS BUT WE WERE NOT AWARE THAT SINCE OUR DEPARTURE THE QUESTION HAD ADVANCED TO FARTHER STAGES OTHER SIMILAR MAXILLARIES THOUGH BELONGING TO INDIVIDUALS OF VARIOUS TYPES AND DIFFERENT NATIONS WERE FOUND IN THE LOOSE GREY SOIL
887-123291-0008 OF CERTAIN GROTTOES IN FRANCE SWITZERLAND AND BELGIUM AS WELL AS WEAPONS TOOLS EARTHEN UTENSILS BONES OF CHILDREN AND ADULTS THE EXISTENCE THEREFORE OF MAN IN THE QUATERNARY PERIOD SEEMED TO BECOME DAILY MORE CERTAIN
887-123291-0009 NOR WAS THIS ALL FRESH DISCOVERIES OF REMAINS IN THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION HAD EMBOLDENED OTHER GEOLOGISTS TO REFER BACK THE HUMAN SPECIES TO A HIGHER ANTIQUITY STILL IT IS TRUE THAT THESE REMAINS WERE NOT HUMAN BONES
887-123291-0010 BUT OBJECTS BEARING THE TRACES OF HIS HANDIWORK SUCH AS FOSSIL LEG BONES OF ANIMALS SCULPTURED AND CARVED EVIDENTLY BY THE HAND OF MAN
887-123291-0011 HE WAS A PREDECESSOR OF THE MASTODON HE WAS A CONTEMPORARY OF THE SOUTHERN ELEPHANT HE LIVED A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO WHEN ACCORDING TO GEOLOGISTS THE PLEIOCENE FORMATION WAS IN PROGRESS
887-123291-0012 SUCH THEN WAS THE STATE OF PALAEONTOLOGICAL SCIENCE AND WHAT WE KNEW OF IT WAS SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN OUR BEHAVIOUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS STUPENDOUS GOLGOTHA ANY ONE MAY NOW UNDERSTAND THE FRENZIED EXCITEMENT OF MY UNCLE WHEN
887-123291-0013 TWENTY YARDS FARTHER ON HE FOUND HIMSELF FACE TO FACE WITH A PRIMITIVE MAN IT WAS A PERFECTLY RECOGNISABLE HUMAN BODY HAD SOME PARTICULAR SOIL LIKE THAT OF THE CEMETERY SAINT MICHEL AT BORDEAUX
887-123291-0014 PRESERVED IT THUS FOR SO MANY AGES IT MIGHT BE SO BUT THIS DRIED CORPSE WITH ITS PARCHMENT LIKE SKIN DRAWN TIGHTLY OVER THE BONY FRAME THE LIMBS STILL PRESERVING THEIR SHAPE SOUND TEETH ABUNDANT HAIR
887-123291-0015 AND FINGER AND TOE NAILS OF FRIGHTFUL LENGTH THIS DESICCATED MUMMY STARTLED US BY APPEARING JUST AS IT HAD LIVED COUNTLESS AGES AGO I STOOD MUTE BEFORE THIS APPARITION OF REMOTE ANTIQUITY MY UNCLE USUALLY SO GARRULOUS
887-123291-0016 WAS STRUCK DUMB LIKEWISE WE RAISED THE BODY WE STOOD IT UP AGAINST A ROCK IT SEEMED TO STARE AT US OUT OF ITS EMPTY ORBITS WE SOUNDED WITH OUR KNUCKLES HIS HOLLOW FRAME AFTER SOME MOMENTS SILENCE THE PROFESSOR WAS HIMSELF AGAIN
887-123291-0017 OTTO LIEDENBROCK YIELDING TO HIS NATURE FORGOT ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF OUR EVENTFUL JOURNEY FORGOT WHERE WE WERE STANDING FORGOT THE VAULTED CAVERN WHICH CONTAINED US NO DOUBT HE WAS IN MIND BACK AGAIN IN HIS JOHANNAEUM
887-123291-0018 HOLDING FORTH TO HIS PUPILS FOR HE ASSUMED HIS LEARNED AIR AND ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO AN IMAGINARY AUDIENCE HE PROCEEDED THUS GENTLEMEN I HAVE THE HONOUR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU A MAN OF THE QUATERNARY OR POST TERTIARY SYSTEM
887-123291-0019 EMINENT GEOLOGISTS HAVE DENIED HIS EXISTENCE OTHERS NO LESS EMINENT HAVE AFFIRMED IT THE SAINT THOMASES OF PALAEONTOLOGY IF THEY WERE HERE MIGHT NOW TOUCH HIM WITH THEIR FINGERS AND WOULD BE OBLIGED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR ERROR
887-123291-0020 I AM QUITE AWARE THAT SCIENCE HAS TO BE ON ITS GUARD WITH DISCOVERIES OF THIS KIND I KNOW WHAT CAPITAL ENTERPRISING INDIVIDUALS LIKE BARNUM HAVE MADE OUT OF FOSSIL MEN I HAVE HEARD THE TALE OF THE KNEEPAN OF AJAX
887-123291-0021 THE PRETENDED BODY OF ORESTES CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BY THE SPARTANS AND OF THE BODY OF ASTERIUS TEN CUBITS LONG
887-123291-0022 I HAVE READ THE REPORTS OF THE SKELETON OF TRAPANI FOUND IN THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY AND WHICH WAS AT THE TIME IDENTIFIED AS THAT OF POLYPHEMUS AND THE HISTORY OF THE GIANT UNEARTHED IN THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY NEAR PALERMO
887-123291-0023 YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO GENTLEMEN THE ANALYSIS MADE AT LUCERNE IN FIFTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN OF THOSE HUGE BONES WHICH THE CELEBRATED DOCTOR FELIX PLATER AFFIRMED TO BE THOSE OF A GIANT NINETEEN FEET HIGH
887-123291-0024 IN THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY I WOULD HAVE STOOD UP FOR SCHEUCHZER'S PRE ADAMITE MAN AGAINST PETER CAMPET I HAVE PERUSED A WRITING
887-123291-0025 HERE MY UNCLE'S UNFORTUNATE INFIRMITY MET HIM THAT OF BEING UNABLE IN PUBLIC TO PRONOUNCE HARD WORDS
887-123291-0026 HE COULD GET NO FURTHER
887-123291-0027 IT WAS NOT TO BE DONE THE UNLUCKY WORD WOULD NOT COME OUT AT THE JOHANNAEUM THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A LAUGH GIGANTOSTEOLOGIE AT LAST THE PROFESSOR BURST OUT BETWEEN TWO WORDS WHICH I SHALL NOT RECORD HERE
887-123291-0028 HAVE RECOGNISED IN THESE BONES NOTHING MORE REMARKABLE THAN THE BONES OF THE MAMMOTH AND OTHER MAMMALS OF THE POST TERTIARY PERIOD BUT IN THE PRESENCE OF THIS SPECIMEN TO DOUBT WOULD BE TO INSULT SCIENCE THERE STANDS THE BODY YOU MAY SEE IT TOUCH IT
887-123291-0029 IT IS NOT A MERE SKELETON IT IS AN ENTIRE BODY
887-123291-0030 I WAS GOOD ENOUGH NOT TO CONTRADICT THIS STARTLING ASSERTION IF I COULD ONLY WASH IT IN A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID PURSUED MY UNCLE I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR IT FROM ALL THE EARTHY PARTICLES AND THE SHELLS WHICH ARE INCRUSTED ABOUT IT
887-123291-0031 BUT I DO NOT POSSESS THAT VALUABLE SOLVENT YET SUCH AS IT IS THE BODY SHALL TELL US ITS OWN WONDERFUL STORY HERE THE PROFESSOR LAID HOLD OF THE FOSSIL SKELETON AND HANDLED IT WITH THE SKILL OF A DEXTEROUS SHOWMAN
887-123291-0032 YOU SEE HE SAID THAT IT IS NOT SIX FEET LONG AND THAT WE ARE STILL SEPARATED BY A LONG INTERVAL FROM THE PRETENDED RACE OF GIANTS
887-123291-0033 IT IS EVIDENTLY CAUCASIAN IT IS THE WHITE RACE OUR OWN THE SKULL OF THIS FOSSIL IS A REGULAR OVAL OR RATHER OVOID IT EXHIBITS NO PROMINENT CHEEKBONES NO PROJECTING JAWS
887-123291-0034 IT PRESENTS NO APPEARANCE OF THAT PROGNATHISM
887-123291-0035 IT IS NEARLY NINETY DEGREES BUT I WILL GO FURTHER IN MY DEDUCTIONS AND I WILL AFFIRM THAT THIS SPECIMEN OF THE HUMAN FAMILY IS OF THE JAPHETIC RACE WHICH HAS SINCE SPREAD FROM THE INDIES TO THE ATLANTIC DON'T SMILE GENTLEMEN NOBODY WAS SMILING
887-123291-0036 BUT THE LEARNED PROFESSOR WAS FREQUENTLY DISTURBED BY THE BROAD SMILES PROVOKED BY HIS LEARNED ECCENTRICITIES YES HE PURSUED WITH ANIMATION THIS IS A FOSSIL MAN THE CONTEMPORARY OF THE MASTODONS WHOSE REMAINS FILL THIS AMPHITHEATRE
887-123291-0037 HOW THOSE STRATA ON WHICH HE LAY SLIPPED DOWN INTO THIS ENORMOUS HOLLOW IN THE GLOBE I CONFESS I CANNOT ANSWER THAT QUESTION
887-123291-0038 CONSIDERABLE COMMOTIONS WERE STILL DISTURBING THE CRUST OF THE EARTH THE LONG CONTINUED COOLING OF THE GLOBE PRODUCED CHASMS FISSURES CLEFTS AND FAULTS INTO WHICH VERY PROBABLY PORTIONS OF THE UPPER EARTH MAY HAVE FALLEN
887-123291-0039 BUT THERE IS THE MAN SURROUNDED BY HIS OWN WORKS BY HATCHETS BY FLINT ARROW HEADS
887-123291-0040 THIS FOSSIL BODY WAS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN THIS IMMENSE CATACOMB WE CAME UPON OTHER BODIES AT EVERY STEP AMONGST THIS MORTAL DUST AND MY UNCLE MIGHT SELECT THE MOST CURIOUS OF THESE SPECIMENS TO DEMOLISH THE INCREDULITY OF SCEPTICS
887-123291-0041 IN FACT IT WAS A WONDERFUL SPECTACLE THAT OF THESE GENERATIONS OF MEN AND ANIMALS COMMINGLED IN A COMMON CEMETERY THEN ONE VERY SERIOUS QUESTION AROSE PRESENTLY WHICH WE SCARCELY DARED TO SUGGEST
887-123291-0042 HAD ALL THOSE CREATURES SLIDED THROUGH A GREAT FISSURE IN THE CRUST OF THE EARTH DOWN TO THE SHORES OF THE LIEDENBROCK SEA WHEN THEY WERE DEAD AND TURNING TO DUST OR HAD THEY LIVED AND GROWN AND DIED HERE IN THIS SUBTERRANEAN WORLD UNDER A FALSE SKY
89-218-0000 CHAPTER TWENTY ONE A MOMENT'S GLANCE WAS ENOUGH TO SATISFY CATHERINE THAT HER APARTMENT WAS VERY UNLIKE THE ONE WHICH HENRY HAD ENDEAVOURED TO ALARM HER BY THE DESCRIPTION OF IT WAS BY NO MEANS UNREASONABLY LARGE AND CONTAINED NEITHER TAPESTRY NOR VELVET
89-218-0001 THE WALLS WERE PAPERED THE FLOOR WAS CARPETED THE WINDOWS WERE NEITHER LESS PERFECT NOR MORE DIM THAN THOSE OF THE DRAWING ROOM BELOW THE FURNITURE THOUGH NOT OF THE LATEST FASHION WAS HANDSOME AND COMFORTABLE AND THE AIR OF THE ROOM ALTOGETHER FAR FROM UNCHEERFUL
89-218-0002 HER HEART INSTANTANEOUSLY AT EASE ON THIS POINT SHE RESOLVED TO LOSE NO TIME IN PARTICULAR EXAMINATION OF ANYTHING AS SHE GREATLY DREADED DISOBLIGING THE GENERAL BY ANY DELAY
89-218-0003 AND SHE WAS PREPARING TO UNPIN THE LINEN PACKAGE WHICH THE CHAISE SEAT HAD CONVEYED FOR HER IMMEDIATE ACCOMMODATION WHEN HER EYE SUDDENLY FELL ON A LARGE HIGH CHEST STANDING BACK IN A DEEP RECESS ON ONE SIDE OF THE FIREPLACE THE SIGHT OF IT MADE HER START
89-218-0004 AND FORGETTING EVERYTHING ELSE SHE STOOD GAZING ON IT IN MOTIONLESS WONDER WHILE THESE THOUGHTS CROSSED HER
89-218-0005 PUSHED BACK TOO AS IF MEANT TO BE OUT OF SIGHT I WILL LOOK INTO IT COST ME WHAT IT MAY I WILL LOOK INTO IT AND DIRECTLY TOO BY DAYLIGHT IF I STAY TILL EVENING MY CANDLE MAY GO OUT SHE ADVANCED AND EXAMINED IT CLOSELY
89-218-0006 IT WAS OF CEDAR CURIOUSLY INLAID WITH SOME DARKER WOOD AND RAISED ABOUT A FOOT FROM THE GROUND ON A CARVED STAND OF THE SAME THE LOCK WAS SILVER THOUGH TARNISHED FROM AGE
89-218-0007 BROKEN PERHAPS PREMATURELY BY SOME STRANGE VIOLENCE AND ON THE CENTRE OF THE LID WAS A MYSTERIOUS CIPHER IN THE SAME METAL CATHERINE BENT OVER IT INTENTLY BUT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO DISTINGUISH ANYTHING WITH CERTAINTY SHE COULD NOT IN WHATEVER DIRECTION SHE TOOK IT
89-218-0008 BELIEVE THE LAST LETTER TO BE A T AND YET THAT IT SHOULD BE ANYTHING ELSE IN THAT HOUSE WAS A CIRCUMSTANCE TO RAISE NO COMMON DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT IF NOT ORIGINALLY THEIRS BY WHAT STRANGE EVENTS COULD IT HAVE FALLEN INTO THE TILNEY FAMILY HER FEARFUL CURIOSITY
89-218-0009 WAS EVERY MOMENT GROWING GREATER AND SEIZING WITH TREMBLING HANDS THE HASP OF THE LOCK SHE RESOLVED AT ALL HAZARDS TO SATISFY HERSELF AT LEAST AS TO ITS CONTENTS WITH DIFFICULTY FOR SOMETHING SEEMED TO RESIST HER EFFORTS SHE RAISED THE LID A FEW INCHES
89-218-0010 BUT AT THAT MOMENT A SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR OF THE ROOM MADE HER STARTING QUIT HER HOLD AND THE LID CLOSED WITH ALARMING VIOLENCE THIS ILL TIMED INTRUDER WAS MISS TILNEY'S MAID SENT BY HER MISTRESS TO BE OF USE TO MISS MORLAND AND THOUGH CATHERINE IMMEDIATELY DISMISSED HER
89-218-0011 AND FORCED HER IN SPITE OF HER ANXIOUS DESIRE TO PENETRATE THIS MYSTERY TO PROCEED IN HER DRESSING WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY HER PROGRESS WAS NOT QUICK FOR HER THOUGHTS AND HER EYES WERE STILL BENT ON THE OBJECT SO WELL CALCULATED TO INTEREST AND ALARM AND THOUGH SHE DARED NOT WASTE A MOMENT UPON A SECOND ATTEMPT
89-218-0012 SHE COULD NOT REMAIN MANY PACES FROM THE CHEST AT LENGTH HOWEVER HAVING SLIPPED ONE ARM INTO HER GOWN HER TOILETTE SEEMED SO NEARLY FINISHED THAT THE IMPATIENCE OF HER CURIOSITY MIGHT SAFELY BE INDULGED
89-218-0013 AND SO DESPERATE SHOULD BE THE EXERTION OF HER STRENGTH THAT UNLESS SECURED BY SUPERNATURAL MEANS THE LID IN ONE MOMENT SHOULD BE THROWN BACK WITH THIS SPIRIT SHE SPRANG FORWARD AND HER CONFIDENCE DID NOT DECEIVE HER HER RESOLUTE EFFORT THREW BACK THE LID AND GAVE TO HER ASTONISHED EYES
89-218-0014 ENTERED THE ROOM AND TO THE RISING SHAME OF HAVING HARBOURED FOR SOME MINUTES AN ABSURD EXPECTATION WAS THEN ADDED THE SHAME OF BEING CAUGHT IN SO IDLE A SEARCH
89-218-0015 SAID MISS TILNEY AS CATHERINE HASTILY CLOSED IT AND TURNED AWAY TO THE GLASS
89-218-0016 CATHERINE HAD NO LEISURE FOR SPEECH BEING AT ONCE BLUSHING TYING HER GOWN AND FORMING WISE RESOLUTIONS WITH THE MOST VIOLENT DISPATCH MISS TILNEY GENTLY HINTED HER FEAR OF BEING LATE AND IN HALF A MINUTE THEY RAN DOWNSTAIRS TOGETHER IN AN ALARM NOT WHOLLY UNFOUNDED
89-218-0017 FOR GENERAL TILNEY WAS PACING THE DRAWING ROOM HIS WATCH IN HIS HAND AND HAVING ON THE VERY INSTANT OF THEIR ENTERING PULLED THE BELL WITH VIOLENCE ORDERED DINNER TO BE ON TABLE DIRECTLY CATHERINE TREMBLED AT THE EMPHASIS WITH WHICH HE SPOKE
89-218-0018 AND SAT PALE AND BREATHLESS IN A MOST HUMBLE MOOD CONCERNED FOR HIS CHILDREN AND DETESTING OLD CHESTS AND THE GENERAL RECOVERING HIS POLITENESS AS HE LOOKED AT HER SPENT THE REST OF HIS TIME IN SCOLDING HIS DAUGHTER FOR SO FOOLISHLY HURRYING HER FAIR FRIEND
89-218-0019 WHO WAS ABSOLUTELY OUT OF BREATH FROM HASTE WHEN THERE WAS NOT THE LEAST OCCASION FOR HURRY IN THE WORLD
89-218-0020 TILL THEY WERE HAPPILY SEATED AT THE DINNER TABLE WHEN THE GENERAL'S COMPLACENT SMILES AND A GOOD APPETITE OF HER OWN RESTORED HER TO PEACE THE DINING PARLOUR WAS A NOBLE ROOM
89-218-0021 AND FITTED UP IN A STYLE OF LUXURY AND EXPENSE WHICH WAS ALMOST LOST ON THE UNPRACTISED EYE OF CATHERINE WHO SAW LITTLE MORE THAN ITS SPACIOUSNESS AND THE NUMBER OF THEIR ATTENDANTS OF THE FORMER SHE SPOKE ALOUD HER ADMIRATION AND THE GENERAL WITH A VERY GRACIOUS COUNTENANCE
89-218-0022 ACKNOWLEDGED THAT IT WAS BY NO MEANS AN ILL SIZED ROOM AND FURTHER CONFESSED THAT THOUGH AS CARELESS ON SUCH SUBJECTS AS MOST PEOPLE HE DID LOOK UPON A TOLERABLY LARGE EATING ROOM AS ONE OF THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE HE SUPPOSED HOWEVER
89-218-0023 THAT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN USED TO MUCH BETTER SIZED APARTMENTS AT MISTER ALLEN'S NO INDEED WAS CATHERINE'S HONEST ASSURANCE MISTER ALLEN'S DINING PARLOUR WAS NOT MORE THAN HALF AS LARGE AND SHE HAD NEVER SEEN SO LARGE A ROOM AS THIS IN HER LIFE
89-218-0024 THE GENERAL'S GOOD HUMOUR INCREASED WHY AS HE HAD SUCH ROOMS HE THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SIMPLE NOT TO MAKE USE OF THEM
89-218-0025 MISTER ALLEN'S HOUSE HE WAS SURE MUST BE EXACTLY OF THE TRUE SIZE FOR RATIONAL HAPPINESS THE EVENING PASSED WITHOUT ANY FURTHER DISTURBANCE AND IN THE OCCASIONAL ABSENCE OF GENERAL TILNEY WITH MUCH POSITIVE CHEERFULNESS
89-218-0026 IT WAS ONLY IN HIS PRESENCE THAT CATHERINE FELT THE SMALLEST FATIGUE FROM HER JOURNEY AND EVEN THEN EVEN IN MOMENTS OF LANGUOR OR RESTRAINT A SENSE OF GENERAL HAPPINESS PREPONDERATED AND SHE COULD THINK OF HER FRIENDS IN BATH WITHOUT ONE WISH OF BEING WITH THEM THE NIGHT WAS STORMY
89-218-0027 THE WIND HAD BEEN RISING AT INTERVALS THE WHOLE AFTERNOON AND BY THE TIME THE PARTY BROKE UP IT BLEW AND RAINED VIOLENTLY CATHERINE AS SHE CROSSED THE HALL LISTENED TO THE TEMPEST WITH SENSATIONS OF AWE AND WHEN SHE HEARD IT RAGE ROUND A CORNER OF THE ANCIENT BUILDING AND CLOSE WITH SUDDEN FURY A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0028 YES THESE WERE CHARACTERISTIC SOUNDS THEY BROUGHT TO HER RECOLLECTION A COUNTLESS VARIETY OF DREADFUL SITUATIONS AND HORRID SCENES WHICH SUCH BUILDINGS HAD WITNESSED AND SUCH STORMS USHERED IN
89-218-0029 AND MOST HEARTILY DID SHE REJOICE IN THE HAPPIER CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HER ENTRANCE WITHIN WALLS SO SOLEMN SHE HAD NOTHING TO DREAD FROM MIDNIGHT ASSASSINS OR DRUNKEN GALLANTS
89-218-0030 HENRY HAD CERTAINLY BEEN ONLY IN JEST IN WHAT HE HAD TOLD HER THAT MORNING IN A HOUSE SO FURNISHED AND SO GUARDED SHE COULD HAVE NOTHING TO EXPLORE OR TO SUFFER AND MIGHT GO TO HER BEDROOM AS SECURELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN HER OWN CHAMBER AT FULLERTON
89-218-0031 SHE WAS ENABLED ESPECIALLY ON PERCEIVING THAT MISS TILNEY SLEPT ONLY TWO DOORS FROM HER TO ENTER HER ROOM WITH A TOLERABLY STOUT HEART AND HER SPIRITS WERE IMMEDIATELY ASSISTED BY THE CHEERFUL BLAZE OF A WOOD FIRE
89-218-0032 AS SO MANY POOR GIRLS HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO DO AND THEN TO HAVE A FAITHFUL OLD SERVANT FRIGHTENING ONE BY COMING IN WITH A FAGGOT HOW GLAD I AM THAT NORTHANGER IS WHAT IT IS IF IT HAD BEEN LIKE SOME OTHER PLACES I DO NOT KNOW THAT IN SUCH A NIGHT AS THIS
89-218-0033 I COULD HAVE ANSWERED FOR MY COURAGE BUT NOW TO BE SURE THERE IS NOTHING TO ALARM ONE SHE LOOKED ROUND THE ROOM THE WINDOW CURTAINS SEEMED IN MOTION
89-218-0034 A GLANCE AT THE OLD CHEST AS SHE TURNED AWAY FROM THIS EXAMINATION WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS USE SHE SCORNED THE CAUSELESS FEARS OF AN IDLE FANCY AND BEGAN WITH A MOST HAPPY INDIFFERENCE TO PREPARE HERSELF FOR BED SHE SHOULD TAKE HER TIME SHE SHOULD NOT HURRY HERSELF
89-218-0035 AS IF SHE WISHED FOR THE PROTECTION OF LIGHT AFTER SHE WERE IN BED THE FIRE THEREFORE DIED AWAY AND CATHERINE HAVING SPENT THE BEST PART OF AN HOUR IN HER ARRANGEMENTS WAS BEGINNING TO THINK OF STEPPING INTO BED WHEN ON GIVING A PARTING GLANCE ROUND THE ROOM
89-218-0036 SHE WAS STRUCK BY THE APPEARANCE OF A HIGH OLD FASHIONED BLACK CABINET WHICH THOUGH IN A SITUATION CONSPICUOUS ENOUGH HAD NEVER CAUGHT HER NOTICE BEFORE HENRY'S WORDS HIS DESCRIPTION OF THE EBONY CABINET WHICH WAS TO ESCAPE HER OBSERVATION AT FIRST
89-218-0037 IMMEDIATELY RUSHED ACROSS HER AND THOUGH THERE COULD BE NOTHING REALLY IN IT THERE WAS SOMETHING WHIMSICAL IT WAS CERTAINLY A VERY REMARKABLE COINCIDENCE SHE TOOK HER CANDLE AND LOOKED CLOSELY AT THE CABINET IT WAS NOT ABSOLUTELY EBONY AND GOLD
89-218-0038 BUT IT WAS JAPAN BLACK AND YELLOW JAPAN OF THE HANDSOMEST KIND AND AS SHE HELD HER CANDLE THE YELLOW HAD VERY MUCH THE EFFECT OF GOLD THE KEY WAS IN THE DOOR AND SHE HAD A STRANGE FANCY TO LOOK INTO IT NOT HOWEVER WITH THE SMALLEST EXPECTATION OF FINDING ANYTHING
89-218-0039 BUT IT WAS SO VERY ODD AFTER WHAT HENRY HAD SAID IN SHORT SHE COULD NOT SLEEP TILL SHE HAD EXAMINED IT SO PLACING THE CANDLE WITH GREAT CAUTION ON A CHAIR SHE SEIZED THE KEY WITH A VERY TREMULOUS HAND AND TRIED TO TURN IT BUT IT RESISTED HER UTMOST STRENGTH
89-218-0040 ALARMED BUT NOT DISCOURAGED SHE TRIED IT ANOTHER WAY A BOLT FLEW AND SHE BELIEVED HERSELF SUCCESSFUL BUT HOW STRANGELY MYSTERIOUS THE DOOR WAS STILL IMMOVABLE SHE PAUSED A MOMENT IN BREATHLESS WONDER
89-218-0041 THE WIND ROARED DOWN THE CHIMNEY THE RAIN BEAT IN TORRENTS AGAINST THE WINDOWS AND EVERYTHING SEEMED TO SPEAK THE AWFULNESS OF HER SITUATION
89-218-0042 TO RETIRE TO BED HOWEVER UNSATISFIED ON SUCH A POINT WOULD BE VAIN SINCE SLEEP MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CABINET SO MYSTERIOUSLY CLOSED IN HER IMMEDIATE VICINITY AGAIN THEREFORE SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO THE KEY
89-218-0043 AND AFTER MOVING IT IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY FOR SOME INSTANTS WITH THE DETERMINED CELERITY OF HOPE'S LAST EFFORT THE DOOR SUDDENLY YIELDED TO HER HAND HER HEART LEAPED WITH EXULTATION AT SUCH A VICTORY
89-218-0044 AND HAVING THROWN OPEN EACH FOLDING DOOR THE SECOND BEING SECURED ONLY BY BOLTS OF LESS WONDERFUL CONSTRUCTION THAN THE LOCK THOUGH IN THAT HER EYE COULD NOT DISCERN ANYTHING UNUSUAL A DOUBLE RANGE OF SMALL DRAWERS APPEARED IN VIEW WITH SOME LARGER DRAWERS ABOVE AND BELOW THEM AND IN THE CENTRE
89-218-0045 A SMALL DOOR CLOSED ALSO WITH A LOCK AND KEY SECURED IN ALL PROBABILITY A CAVITY OF IMPORTANCE CATHERINE'S HEART BEAT QUICK BUT HER COURAGE DID NOT FAIL HER WITH A CHEEK FLUSHED BY HOPE AND AN EYE STRAINING WITH CURIOSITY
89-218-0046 HER FINGERS GRASPED THE HANDLE OF A DRAWER AND DREW IT FORTH IT WAS ENTIRELY EMPTY WITH LESS ALARM AND GREATER EAGERNESS SHE SEIZED A SECOND A THIRD A FOURTH EACH WAS EQUALLY EMPTY NOT ONE WAS LEFT UNSEARCHED
89-218-0047 AND IN NOT ONE WAS ANYTHING FOUND WELL READ IN THE ART OF CONCEALING A TREASURE THE POSSIBILITY OF FALSE LININGS TO THE DRAWERS DID NOT ESCAPE HER AND SHE FELT ROUND EACH WITH ANXIOUS ACUTENESS IN VAIN THE PLACE IN THE MIDDLE ALONE REMAINED NOW UNEXPLORED AND THOUGH SHE HAD
89-218-0048 HER QUICK EYES DIRECTLY FELL ON A ROLL OF PAPER PUSHED BACK INTO THE FURTHER PART OF THE CAVITY APPARENTLY FOR CONCEALMENT AND HER FEELINGS AT THAT MOMENT WERE INDESCRIBABLE HER HEART FLUTTERED HER KNEES TREMBLED AND HER CHEEKS GREW PALE
89-218-0049 SHE SEIZED WITH AN UNSTEADY HAND THE PRECIOUS MANUSCRIPT
89-218-0050 AND WHILE SHE ACKNOWLEDGED WITH AWFUL SENSATIONS THIS STRIKING EXEMPLIFICATION OF WHAT HENRY HAD FORETOLD RESOLVED INSTANTLY TO PERUSE EVERY LINE BEFORE SHE ATTEMPTED TO REST THE DIMNESS OF THE LIGHT HER CANDLE EMITTED MADE HER TURN TO IT WITH ALARM
89-218-0051 A LAMP COULD NOT HAVE EXPIRED WITH MORE AWFUL EFFECT CATHERINE FOR A FEW MOMENTS WAS MOTIONLESS WITH HORROR IT WAS DONE COMPLETELY NOT A REMNANT OF LIGHT IN THE WICK COULD GIVE HOPE TO THE REKINDLING BREATH DARKNESS IMPENETRABLE AND IMMOVABLE FILLED THE ROOM
89-218-0052 A VIOLENT GUST OF WIND RISING WITH SUDDEN FURY ADDED FRESH HORROR TO THE MOMENT CATHERINE TREMBLED FROM HEAD TO FOOT IN THE PAUSE WHICH SUCCEEDED A SOUND LIKE RECEDING FOOTSTEPS AND THE CLOSING OF A DISTANT DOOR
89-218-0053 STRUCK ON HER AFFRIGHTED EAR HUMAN NATURE COULD SUPPORT NO MORE A COLD SWEAT STOOD ON HER FOREHEAD THE MANUSCRIPT FELL FROM HER HAND AND GROPING HER WAY TO THE BED SHE JUMPED HASTILY IN AND SOUGHT SOME SUSPENSION OF AGONY BY CREEPING FAR UNDERNEATH THE CLOTHES
89-218-0054 TO CLOSE HER EYES IN SLEEP THAT NIGHT SHE FELT MUST BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH A CURIOSITY SO JUSTLY AWAKENED AND FEELINGS IN EVERY WAY SO AGITATED REPOSE MUST BE ABSOLUTELY IMPOSSIBLE THE STORM TOO ABROAD SO DREADFUL
89-218-0055 SHE HAD NOT BEEN USED TO FEEL ALARM FROM WIND BUT NOW EVERY BLAST SEEMED FRAUGHT WITH AWFUL INTELLIGENCE THE MANUSCRIPT SO WONDERFULLY FOUND SO WONDERFULLY ACCOMPLISHING THE MORNING'S PREDICTION HOW WAS IT TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR WHAT COULD IT CONTAIN
89-218-0056 BY WHAT MEANS COULD IT HAVE BEEN SO LONG CONCEALED AND HOW SINGULARLY STRANGE THAT IT SHOULD FALL TO HER LOT TO DISCOVER IT TILL SHE HAD MADE HERSELF MISTRESS OF ITS CONTENTS HOWEVER SHE COULD HAVE NEITHER REPOSE NOR COMFORT AND WITH THE SUN'S FIRST RAYS SHE WAS DETERMINED TO PERUSE IT
89-218-0057 AS IF BY THE ATTEMPT OF SOMEBODY TO ENTER HOLLOW MURMURS SEEMED TO CREEP ALONG THE GALLERY AND MORE THAN ONCE HER BLOOD WAS CHILLED BY THE SOUND OF DISTANT MOANS
89-219-0000 INSTANTANEOUSLY WITH THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF EXISTENCE RETURNED HER RECOLLECTION OF THE MANUSCRIPT AND SPRINGING FROM THE BED IN THE VERY MOMENT OF THE MAID'S GOING AWAY SHE EAGERLY COLLECTED EVERY SCATTERED SHEET WHICH HAD BURST FROM THE ROLL ON ITS FALLING TO THE GROUND AND FLEW BACK TO ENJOY THE LUXURY OF THEIR PERUSAL ON HER PILLOW
89-219-0001 SHE NOW PLAINLY SAW THAT SHE MUST NOT EXPECT A MANUSCRIPT OF EQUAL LENGTH WITH THE GENERALITY OF WHAT SHE HAD SHUDDERED OVER IN BOOKS FOR THE ROLL SEEMING TO CONSIST ENTIRELY OF SMALL DISJOINTED SHEETS WAS ALTOGETHER BUT OF TRIFLING SIZE
89-219-0002 AND MUCH LESS THAN SHE HAD SUPPOSED IT TO BE AT FIRST HER GREEDY EYE GLANCED RAPIDLY OVER A PAGE SHE STARTED AT ITS IMPORT COULD IT BE POSSIBLE OR DID NOT HER SENSES PLAY HER FALSE AN INVENTORY OF LINEN
89-219-0003 IN COARSE AND MODERN CHARACTERS SEEMED ALL THAT WAS BEFORE HER IF THE EVIDENCE OF SIGHT MIGHT BE TRUSTED SHE HELD A WASHING BILL IN HER HAND SHE SEIZED ANOTHER SHEET AND SAW THE SAME ARTICLES WITH LITTLE VARIATION A THIRD A FOURTH AND A FIFTH PRESENTED NOTHING NEW
89-219-0004 SHIRTS STOCKINGS CRAVATS AND WAISTCOATS FACED HER IN EACH TWO OTHERS PENNED BY THE SAME HAND MARKED AN EXPENDITURE SCARCELY MORE INTERESTING IN LETTERS HAIR POWDER SHOE STRING AND BREECHES BALL AND THE LARGER SHEET
89-219-0005 TO SUPPOSE THAT A MANUSCRIPT OF MANY GENERATIONS BACK COULD HAVE REMAINED UNDISCOVERED IN A ROOM SUCH AS THAT SO MODERN SO HABITABLE
89-219-0006 FOR HAD NOT THE CABINET APPEARED SO EXACTLY TO AGREE WITH HIS DESCRIPTION OF HER ADVENTURES SHE SHOULD NEVER HAVE FELT THE SMALLEST CURIOSITY ABOUT IT THIS WAS THE ONLY COMFORT THAT OCCURRED IMPATIENT TO GET RID OF THOSE HATEFUL EVIDENCES OF HER FOLLY THOSE DETESTABLE PAPERS THEN SCATTERED OVER THE BED
89-219-0007 FOR SHE COULD NOW MANAGE THEM WITH PERFECT EASE IN THIS THERE WAS SURELY SOMETHING MYSTERIOUS AND SHE INDULGED IN THE FLATTERING SUGGESTION FOR HALF A MINUTE TILL THE POSSIBILITY OF THE DOOR'S HAVING BEEN AT FIRST UNLOCKED
89-219-0008 AND YET UNEQUAL TO AN ABSOLUTE FALSEHOOD
89-219-0009 BUT WE HAVE A CHARMING MORNING AFTER IT SHE ADDED DESIRING TO GET RID OF THE SUBJECT
89-219-0010 AND HOW MIGHT YOU LEARN BY ACCIDENT OR ARGUMENT
89-219-0011 AS A MEANS OF GETTING YOU OUT OF DOORS AND TEMPTING YOU TO MORE FREQUENT EXERCISE THAN YOU WOULD OTHERWISE TAKE AND THOUGH THE LOVE OF A HYACINTH MAY BE RATHER DOMESTIC WHO CAN TELL THE SENTIMENT ONCE RAISED BUT YOU MAY IN TIME COME TO LOVE A ROSE
89-219-0012 BUT I DO NOT WANT ANY SUCH PURSUIT TO GET ME OUT OF DOORS THE PLEASURE OF WALKING AND BREATHING FRESH AIR IS ENOUGH FOR ME
89-219-0013 MAMMA SAYS I AM NEVER WITHIN
89-219-0014 THE MERE HABIT OF LEARNING TO LOVE IS THE THING AND A TEACHABLENESS OF DISPOSITION IN A YOUNG LADY IS A GREAT BLESSING HAS MY SISTER A PLEASANT MODE OF INSTRUCTION CATHERINE WAS SAVED THE EMBARRASSMENT OF ATTEMPTING AN ANSWER BY THE ENTRANCE OF THE GENERAL
89-219-0015 WHOSE SMILING COMPLIMENTS ANNOUNCED A HAPPY STATE OF MIND BUT WHOSE GENTLE HINT OF SYMPATHETIC EARLY RISING DID NOT ADVANCE HER COMPOSURE THE ELEGANCE OF THE BREAKFAST SET FORCED ITSELF ON CATHERINE'S NOTICE WHEN THEY WERE SEATED AT TABLE AND LUCIDLY IT HAD BEEN THE GENERAL'S CHOICE
89-219-0016 HE WAS ENCHANTED BY HER APPROBATION OF HIS TASTE CONFESSED IT TO BE NEAT AND SIMPLE THOUGHT IT RIGHT TO ENCOURAGE THE MANUFACTURE OF HIS COUNTRY AND FOR HIS PART TO HIS UNCRITICAL PALATE THE TEA WAS AS WELL FLAVOURED FROM THE CLAY OF STAFFORDSHIRE
89-219-0017 HE TRUSTED HOWEVER THAT AN OPPORTUNITY MIGHT ERE LONG OCCUR OF SELECTING ONE THOUGH NOT FOR HIMSELF CATHERINE WAS PROBABLY THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND HIM
89-219-0018 SHORTLY AFTER BREAKFAST HENRY LEFT THEM FOR WOODSTON WHERE BUSINESS REQUIRED AND WOULD KEEP HIM TWO OR THREE DAYS THEY ALL ATTENDED IN THE HALL TO SEE HIM MOUNT HIS HORSE AND IMMEDIATELY ON RE ENTERING THE BREAKFAST ROOM CATHERINE WALKED TO A WINDOW IN THE HOPE OF CATCHING ANOTHER GLIMPSE OF HIS FIGURE
89-219-0019 OBSERVED THE GENERAL TO ELEANOR WOODSTON WILL MAKE BUT A SOMBRE APPEARANCE TODAY IS IT A PRETTY PLACE ASKED CATHERINE WHAT SAY YOU ELEANOR SPEAK YOUR OPINION FOR LADIES CAN BEST TELL THE TASTE OF LADIES IN REGARD TO PLACES AS WELL AS MEN
89-219-0020 I THINK IT WOULD BE ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE MOST IMPARTIAL EYE TO HAVE MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THE HOUSE STANDS AMONG FINE MEADOWS FACING THE SOUTH EAST WITH AN EXCELLENT KITCHEN GARDEN IN THE SAME ASPECT
89-219-0021 THE WALLS SURROUNDING WHICH I BUILT AND STOCKED MYSELF ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO FOR THE BENEFIT OF MY SON IT IS A FAMILY LIVING MISS MORLAND AND THE PROPERTY IN THE PLACE BEING CHIEFLY MY OWN YOU MAY BELIEVE I TAKE CARE THAT IT SHALL NOT BE A BAD ONE
89-219-0022 DID HENRY'S INCOME DEPEND SOLELY ON THIS LIVING HE WOULD NOT BE ILL PROVIDED FOR PERHAPS IT MAY SEEM ODD THAT WITH ONLY TWO YOUNGER CHILDREN I SHOULD THINK ANY PROFESSION NECESSARY FOR HIM AND CERTAINLY THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE COULD ALL WISH HIM DISENGAGED FROM EVERY TIE OF BUSINESS
89-219-0023 BUT THOUGH I MAY NOT EXACTLY MAKE CONVERTS OF YOU YOUNG LADIES I AM SURE YOUR FATHER MISS MORLAND WOULD AGREE WITH ME IN THINKING IT EXPEDIENT TO GIVE EVERY YOUNG MAN SOME EMPLOYMENT THE MONEY IS NOTHING IT IS NOT AN OBJECT BUT EMPLOYMENT IS THE THING
89-219-0024 HAS HIS PROFESSION THE IMPOSING EFFECT OF THIS LAST ARGUMENT WAS EQUAL TO HIS WISHES THE SILENCE OF THE LADY PROVED IT TO BE UNANSWERABLE SOMETHING HAD BEEN SAID THE EVENING BEFORE OF HER BEING SHOWN OVER THE HOUSE AND HE NOW OFFERED HIMSELF AS HER CONDUCTOR
89-219-0025 AND THOUGH CATHERINE HAD HOPED TO EXPLORE IT ACCOMPANIED ONLY BY HIS DAUGHTER IT WAS A PROPOSAL OF TOO MUCH HAPPINESS IN ITSELF UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE GLADLY ACCEPTED
89-219-0026 AND HAD SEEN ONLY A FEW OF ITS ROOMS THE NETTING BOX JUST LEISURELY DRAWN FORTH WAS CLOSED WITH JOYFUL HASTE AND SHE WAS READY TO ATTEND HIM IN A MOMENT
89-219-0027 THE PLEASURE OF ACCOMPANYING HER INTO THE SHRUBBERIES AND GARDEN SHE CURTSIED HER ACQUIESCENCE BUT PERHAPS IT MIGHT BE MORE AGREEABLE TO HER TO MAKE THOSE HER FIRST OBJECT
89-219-0028 THE WEATHER WAS AT PRESENT FAVOURABLE AND AT THIS TIME OF YEAR THE UNCERTAINTY WAS VERY GREAT OF ITS CONTINUING SO WHICH WOULD SHE PREFER HE WAS EQUALLY AT HER SERVICE
89-219-0029 HE YIELDED IMPLICITLY AND WOULD FETCH HIS HAT AND ATTEND THEM IN A MOMENT HE LEFT THE ROOM AND CATHERINE WITH A DISAPPOINTED ANXIOUS FACE BEGAN TO SPEAK OF HER UNWILLINGNESS THAT HE SHOULD BE TAKING THEM OUT OF DOORS AGAINST HIS OWN INCLINATION UNDER A MISTAKEN IDEA OF PLEASING HER
89-219-0030 CATHERINE DID NOT EXACTLY KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE UNDERSTOOD WHY WAS MISS TILNEY EMBARRASSED COULD THERE BE ANY UNWILLINGNESS ON THE GENERAL'S SIDE TO SHOW HER OVER THE ABBEY THE PROPOSAL WAS HIS OWN
89-219-0031 NEITHER HER FATHER NOR MISTER ALLEN DID SO IT WAS CERTAINLY VERY PROVOKING
89-219-0032 IF HENRY HAD BEEN WITH THEM INDEED BUT NOW SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW WHAT WAS PICTURESQUE WHEN SHE SAW IT SUCH WERE HER THOUGHTS BUT SHE KEPT THEM TO HERSELF AND PUT ON HER BONNET IN PATIENT DISCONTENT SHE WAS STRUCK HOWEVER BEYOND HER EXPECTATION BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE ABBEY
89-219-0033 AS SHE SAW IT FOR THE FIRST TIME FROM THE LAWN THE WHOLE BUILDING ENCLOSED A LARGE COURT AND TWO SIDES OF THE QUADRANGLE RICH IN GOTHIC ORNAMENTS STOOD FORWARD FOR ADMIRATION THE REMAINDER WAS SHUT OFF BY KNOLLS OF OLD TREES OR LUXURIANT PLANTATIONS
89-219-0034 AND THE STEEP WOODY HILLS RISING BEHIND TO GIVE IT SHELTER WERE BEAUTIFUL EVEN IN THE LEAFLESS MONTH OF MARCH CATHERINE HAD SEEN NOTHING TO COMPARE WITH IT AND HER FEELINGS OF DELIGHT WERE SO STRONG THAT WITHOUT WAITING FOR ANY BETTER AUTHORITY SHE BOLDLY BURST FORTH IN WONDER AND PRAISE
89-219-0035 THE GENERAL LISTENED WITH ASSENTING GRATITUDE AND IT SEEMED AS IF HIS OWN ESTIMATION OF NORTHANGER HAD WAITED UNFIXED TILL THAT HOUR
89-219-0036 AND HE LED THE WAY TO IT ACROSS A SMALL PORTION OF THE PARK THE NUMBER OF ACRES CONTAINED IN THIS GARDEN WAS SUCH AS CATHERINE COULD NOT LISTEN TO WITHOUT DISMAY BEING MORE THAN DOUBLE THE EXTENT OF ALL MISTER ALLEN'S AS WELL AS HER FATHER'S INCLUDING CHURCH YARD AND ORCHARD
89-219-0037 THE WALLS SEEMED COUNTLESS IN NUMBER ENDLESS IN LENGTH A VILLAGE OF HOT HOUSES SEEMED TO ARISE AMONG THEM AND A WHOLE PARISH TO BE AT WORK WITHIN THE ENCLOSURE THE GENERAL WAS FLATTERED BY HER LOOKS OF SURPRISE WHICH TOLD HIM ALMOST AS PLAINLY
89-219-0038 AS HE SOON FORCED HER TO TELL HIM IN WORDS THAT SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY GARDENS AT ALL EQUAL TO THEM BEFORE
89-219-0039 WITHOUT ANY AMBITION OF THAT SORT HIMSELF WITHOUT ANY SOLICITUDE ABOUT IT HE DID BELIEVE THEM TO BE UNRIVALLED IN THE KINGDOM IF HE HAD A HOBBY HORSE IT WAS THAT HE LOVED A GARDEN THOUGH CARELESS ENOUGH IN MOST MATTERS OF EATING HE LOVED GOOD FRUIT
89-219-0040 OR IF HE DID NOT HIS FRIENDS AND CHILDREN DID THERE WERE GREAT VEXATIONS HOWEVER ATTENDING SUCH A GARDEN AS HIS
89-219-0041 WITH A TRIUMPHANT SMILE OF SELF SATISFACTION THE GENERAL WISHED HE COULD DO THE SAME
89-219-0042 BY ITS FALLING SHORT OF HIS PLAN HOW WERE MISTER ALLEN'S SUCCESSION HOUSES WORKED DESCRIBING THE NATURE OF HIS OWN AS THEY ENTERED THEM MISTER ALLEN HAD ONLY ONE SMALL HOT HOUSE WHICH MISSUS ALLEN HAD THE USE OF FOR HER PLANTS IN WINTER AND THERE WAS A FIRE IN IT NOW AND THEN
89-219-0043 HE IS A HAPPY MAN SAID THE GENERAL WITH A LOOK OF VERY HAPPY CONTEMPT HAVING TAKEN HER INTO EVERY DIVISION AND LED HER UNDER EVERY WALL TILL SHE WAS HEARTILY WEARY OF SEEING AND WONDERING
89-219-0044 HE SUFFERED THE GIRLS AT LAST TO SEIZE THE ADVANTAGE OF AN OUTER DOOR AND THEN EXPRESSING HIS WISH TO EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF SOME RECENT ALTERATIONS ABOUT THE TEA HOUSE PROPOSED IT AS NO UNPLEASANT EXTENSION OF THEIR WALK IF MISS MORLAND WERE NOT TIRED
89-219-0045 BUT WHERE ARE YOU GOING ELEANOR WHY DO YOU CHOOSE THAT COLD DAMP PATH TO IT MISS MORLAND WILL GET WET OUR BEST WAY IS ACROSS THE PARK
89-219-0046 SAID MISS TILNEY THAT I ALWAYS THINK IT THE BEST AND NEAREST WAY
89-219-0047 IT WAS A NARROW WINDING PATH THROUGH A THICK GROVE OF OLD SCOTCH FIRS AND CATHERINE STRUCK BY ITS GLOOMY ASPECT AND EAGER TO ENTER IT COULD NOT EVEN BY THE GENERAL'S DISAPPROBATION BE KEPT FROM STEPPING FORWARD
89-219-0048 HE PERCEIVED HER INCLINATION AND HAVING AGAIN URGED THE PLEA OF HEALTH IN VAIN WAS TOO POLITE TO MAKE FURTHER OPPOSITION HE EXCUSED HIMSELF HOWEVER FROM ATTENDING THEM THE RAYS OF THE SUN WERE NOT TOO CHEERFUL FOR HIM AND HE WOULD MEET THEM BY ANOTHER COURSE HE TURNED AWAY
89-219-0049 AND CATHERINE WAS SHOCKED TO FIND HOW MUCH HER SPIRITS WERE RELIEVED BY THE SEPARATION
89-219-0050 OFFERED IT NO INJURY AND SHE BEGAN TO TALK WITH EASY GAIETY OF THE DELIGHTFUL MELANCHOLY WHICH SUCH A GROVE INSPIRED I AM PARTICULARLY FOND OF THIS SPOT SAID HER COMPANION WITH A SIGH IT WAS MY MOTHER'S FAVOURITE WALK
89-219-0051 CATHERINE HAD NEVER HEARD MISSUS TILNEY MENTIONED IN THE FAMILY BEFORE AND THE INTEREST EXCITED BY THIS TENDER REMEMBRANCE SHOWED ITSELF DIRECTLY IN HER ALTERED COUNTENANCE AND IN THE ATTENTIVE PAUSE WITH WHICH SHE WAITED FOR SOMETHING MORE
89-219-0052 ADDED ELEANOR THOUGH I NEVER LOVED IT THEN AS I HAVE LOVED IT SINCE AT THAT TIME INDEED I USED TO WONDER AT HER CHOICE BUT HER MEMORY ENDEARS IT NOW AND OUGHT IT NOT REFLECTED CATHERINE TO ENDEAR IT TO HER HUSBAND YET THE GENERAL WOULD NOT ENTER IT
89-219-0053 MISS TILNEY CONTINUING SILENT SHE VENTURED TO SAY HER DEATH MUST HAVE BEEN A GREAT AFFLICTION A GREAT AND INCREASING ONE REPLIED THE OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
89-219-0054 I WAS ONLY THIRTEEN WHEN IT HAPPENED AND THOUGH I FELT MY LOSS PERHAPS AS STRONGLY AS ONE SO YOUNG COULD FEEL IT I DID NOT I COULD NOT THEN KNOW WHAT A LOSS IT WAS SHE STOPPED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN ADDED WITH GREAT FIRMNESS
89-219-0055 A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN ALWAYS PRESENT A MOTHER WOULD HAVE BEEN A CONSTANT FRIEND
89-219-0056 WAS SHE A VERY CHARMING WOMAN WAS SHE HANDSOME WAS THERE ANY PICTURE OF HER IN THE ABBEY
89-219-0057 WAS IT FROM DEJECTION OF SPIRITS WERE QUESTIONS NOW EAGERLY POURED FORTH THE FIRST THREE RECEIVED A READY AFFIRMATIVE
89-219-0058 HER PICTURE I SUPPOSE BLUSHING AT THE CONSUMMATE ART OF HER OWN QUESTION HANGS IN YOUR FATHER'S ROOM NO IT WAS INTENDED FOR THE DRAWING ROOM BUT MY FATHER WAS DISSATISFIED WITH THE PAINTING AND FOR SOME TIME IT HAD NO PLACE
89-219-0059 SOON AFTER HER DEATH I OBTAINED IT FOR MY OWN AND HUNG IT IN MY BED CHAMBER
89-219-0060 IT IS VERY LIKE HERE WAS ANOTHER PROOF A PORTRAIT VERY LIKE OF A DEPARTED WIFE NOT VALUED BY THE HUSBAND HE MUST HAVE BEEN DREADFULLY CRUEL TO HER
89-219-0061 IN SPITE OF ALL HIS ATTENTIONS HE HAD PREVIOUSLY EXCITED AND WHAT HAD BEEN TERROR AND DISLIKE BEFORE WAS NOW ABSOLUTE AVERSION YES AVERSION HIS CRUELTY TO SUCH A CHARMING WOMAN MADE HIM ODIOUS TO HER
89-219-0062 SHE HAD OFTEN READ OF SUCH CHARACTERS CHARACTERS WHICH MISTER ALLEN HAD BEEN USED TO CALL UNNATURAL AND OVERDRAWN BUT HERE WAS PROOF POSITIVE OF THE CONTRARY SHE HAD JUST SETTLED THIS POINT WHEN THE END OF THE PATH BROUGHT THEM DIRECTLY UPON THE GENERAL
89-219-0063 AND IN SPITE OF ALL HER VIRTUOUS INDIGNATION SHE FOUND HERSELF AGAIN OBLIGED TO WALK WITH HIM LISTEN TO HIM AND EVEN TO SMILE WHEN HE SMILED BEING NO LONGER ABLE HOWEVER TO RECEIVE PLEASURE FROM THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS SHE SOON BEGAN TO WALK WITH LASSITUDE
89-219-0064 THE GENERAL PERCEIVED IT AND WITH A CONCERN FOR HER HEALTH WHICH SEEMED TO REPROACH HER FOR HER OPINION OF HIM WAS MOST URGENT FOR RETURNING WITH HIS DAUGHTER TO THE HOUSE HE WOULD FOLLOW THEM IN A QUARTER OF AN HOUR
8975-270782-0000 THIRTEENTH LECTURE THE DREAM ARCHAIC REMNANTS AND INFANTILISM IN THE DREAM LET US REVERT TO OUR CONCLUSION THAT THE DREAM WORK UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0001 TRANSFORMS THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS INTO SOME OTHER FORM OF EXPRESSION THE LATENT THOUGHTS ARE NO OTHER THAN THE CONSCIOUS THOUGHTS KNOWN TO US IN OUR WAKING HOURS THE NEW MODE OF EXPRESSION IS INCOMPREHENSIBLE TO US BECAUSE OF ITS MANY SIDED FEATURES
8975-270782-0002 SO WE CALLED THE MODE OF EXPRESSION OF THE DREAM WORK THE ARCHAIC OR REGRESSIVE YOU MAY CONCLUDE THAT AS A RESULT OF THE DEEPER STUDY OF THE DREAM WORK WE GAIN VALUABLE INFORMATION ABOUT THE RATHER UNKNOWN BEGINNINGS OF OUR INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENT I TRUST THIS WILL BE TRUE
8975-270782-0003 BUT THIS WORK HAS NOT UP TO THE PRESENT TIME BEEN UNDERTAKEN THE ANTIQUITY INTO WHICH THE DREAM WORK CARRIES US BACK IS OF A DOUBLE ASPECT FIRSTLY THE INDIVIDUAL ANTIQUITY CHILDHOOD AND SECONDLY IN SO FAR AS EVERY INDIVIDUAL IN HIS CHILDHOOD
8975-270782-0004 THAT WE SHALL BE ABLE TO DIFFERENTIATE WHICH PART OF THE LATENT PSYCHIC PROCEEDING HAS ITS SOURCE IN THE INDIVIDUAL
8975-270782-0005 IN THIS CONNECTION IT APPEARS TO ME FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE SYMBOLIC RELATIONS WHICH THE INDIVIDUAL HAS NEVER LEARNED
8975-270782-0006 HOWEVER THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ARCHAIC CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DREAM YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW FROM YOUR OWN EXPERIENCES THE PECULIAR AMNESIA THAT IS LOSS OF MEMORY CONCERNING CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE FACT THAT THE FIRST YEARS TO THE FIFTH
8975-270782-0007 THAT OF A GAP IN THE MEMORY IS FAR MORE FREQUENT I BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT LAID ENOUGH STRESS ON THIS FACT THE CHILD IS ABLE TO SPEAK WELL AT THE AGE OF TWO IT SOON SHOWS THAT IT CAN BECOME ADJUSTED TO THE MOST COMPLICATED PSYCHIC SITUATIONS
8975-270782-0008 AND MAKES REMARKS WHICH YEARS LATER ARE RETOLD TO IT BUT WHICH IT HAS ITSELF ENTIRELY FORGOTTEN BESIDES THE MEMORY IN THE EARLY YEARS IS MORE FACILE BECAUSE IT IS LESS BURDENED THAN IN LATER YEARS
8975-270782-0009 NOR IS THERE ANY REASON FOR CONSIDERING THE MEMORY FUNCTION AS A PARTICULARLY HIGH OR DIFFICULT PSYCHIC PERFORMANCE IN FACT THE CONTRARY IS TRUE AND YOU CAN FIND A GOOD MEMORY IN PERSONS WHO STAND VERY LOW INTELLECTUALLY
8975-270782-0010 I MUST POINT OUT THAT CERTAIN WELL PRESERVED MEMORIES FOR THE MOST PART FORMATIVELY EXPERIENCED STAND FORTH IN THIS MEMORY VOID WHICH SURROUNDS THE FIRST YEARS OF CHILDHOOD AND DO NOT JUSTIFY THIS HYPOTHESIS
8975-270782-0011 OUR MEMORY DEALS SELECTIVELY WITH ITS LATER MATERIALS WITH IMPRESSIONS WHICH COME TO US IN LATER LIFE IT RETAINS THE IMPORTANT AND DISCARDS THE UNIMPORTANT THIS IS NOT TRUE OF THE RETAINED CHILDHOOD MEMORIES
8975-270782-0012 THEY DO NOT BESPEAK NECESSARILY IMPORTANT EXPERIENCES OF CHILDHOOD NOT EVEN SUCH AS FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD NEED APPEAR OF IMPORTANCE THEY ARE OFTEN SO BANAL AND INTRINSICALLY SO MEANINGLESS THAT WE ASK OURSELVES IN WONDER WHY JUST THESE DETAILS
8975-270782-0013 HAVE ESCAPED BEING FORGOTTEN I ONCE ENDEAVORED TO APPROACH THE RIDDLE OF CHILDHOOD AMNESIA AND THE INTERRUPTED MEMORY REMNANTS WITH THE HELP OF ANALYSIS AND I ARRIVED AT THE CONCLUSION THAT IN THE CASE OF THE CHILD TOO
8975-270782-0014 BY MEANS OF CAREFUL ANALYSIS ONE IS ABLE TO DEVELOP OUT OF THEM EVERYTHING THAT IS FORGOTTEN
8975-270782-0015 AND IN SO FAR AS THE CURE IS TO ANY DEGREE SUCCESSFUL WE ARE ABLE AGAIN TO BRING TO LIGHT THE CONTENT OF THE CHILDHOOD YEARS THUS CLOUDED IN FORGETFULNESS THESE IMPRESSIONS HAVE NEVER REALLY BEEN FORGOTTEN THEY HAVE ONLY BEEN INACCESSIBLE LATENT
8975-270782-0016 HAVE BELONGED TO THE UNCONSCIOUS BUT SOMETIMES THEY BOB UP OUT OF THE UNCONSCIOUS SPONTANEOUSLY AND AS A MATTER OF FACT THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS IN DREAMS IT IS APPARENT THAT THE DREAM LIFE KNOWS HOW TO FIND THE ENTRANCE TO THESE LATENT
8975-270782-0017 BEAUTIFUL EXAMPLES OF THIS OCCUR IN LITERATURE AND I MYSELF CAN PRESENT SUCH AN EXAMPLE I ONCE DREAMED IN A CERTAIN CONNECTION OF A PERSON WHO MUST HAVE PERFORMED SOME SERVICE FOR ME AND WHOM I CLEARLY SAW HE WAS A ONE EYED MAN SHORT IN STATURE STOUT
8975-270782-0018 HIS HEAD DEEPLY SUNK INTO HIS NECK I CONCLUDED FROM THE CONTENT THAT HE WAS A PHYSICIAN LUCKILY I WAS ABLE TO ASK MY MOTHER WHO WAS STILL LIVING HOW THE PHYSICIAN IN MY BIRTH PLACE WHICH I LEFT WHEN I WAS THREE YEARS OLD LOOKED
8975-270782-0019 AND I LEARNED FROM HER THAT HE HAD ONE EYE WAS SHORT AND STOUT WITH HIS HEAD SUNK INTO HIS NECK AND ALSO LEARNED AT WHAT FORGOTTEN MISHAP HE HAD BEEN OF SERVICE TO ME THIS CONTROL OVER THE FORGOTTEN MATERIAL OF CHILDHOOD YEARS
8975-270782-0020 IS THEN A FURTHER ARCHAIC TENDENCY OF THE DREAM THE SAME INFORMATION MAY BE MADE USE OF IN ANOTHER OF THE PUZZLES THAT HAVE PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO US YOU WILL RECALL HOW ASTONISHED PEOPLE WERE
8975-270782-0021 WHEN WE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE STIMULI WHICH GAVE RISE TO DREAMS WERE EXTREMELY BAD AND LICENTIOUS SEXUAL DESIRES WHICH HAVE MADE DREAM CENSORSHIP AND DREAM DISTORTION NECESSARY AFTER WE HAVE INTERPRETED SUCH A DREAM FOR THE DREAMER AND HE
8975-270782-0022 IN THE MOST FAVORABLE CIRCUMSTANCES DOES NOT ATTACK THE INTERPRETATION ITSELF HE ALMOST ALWAYS ASKS THE QUESTION WHENCE SUCH A WISH COMES
8975-270782-0023 WE NEED NOT HESITATE TO POINT OUT THIS ORIGIN THESE EVIL WISH IMPULSES HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE PAST OFTEN IN A PAST WHICH IS NOT TOO FAR AWAY
8975-270782-0024 THE WOMAN WHOSE DREAM IS INTERPRETED TO MEAN THAT SHE WOULD LIKE TO SEE HER SEVENTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER DEAD DISCOVERS UNDER OUR GUIDANCE THAT SHE IN FACT AT ONE TIME ENTERTAINED THIS WISH
8975-270782-0025 WHICH EARLY ENDED IN A SEPARATION
8975-270782-0026 SHE BEAT HER BODY WITH HER FISTS IN A FIT OF ANGER IN ORDER TO KILL THE CHILD HOW MANY MOTHERS WHO TO DAY LOVE THEIR CHILDREN TENDERLY PERHAPS TOO TENDERLY RECEIVED THEM UNWILLINGLY AND AT THE TIME WISHED THAT THE LIFE WITHIN THEM WOULD NOT DEVELOP FURTHER
8975-270782-0027 INDEED TRANSLATED THIS WISH INTO VARIOUS ACTIONS HAPPILY HARMLESS THE LATER DEATH WISH AGAINST SOME LOVED ONE WHICH SEEMS SO STRANGE ALSO HAS ITS ORIGIN IN EARLY PHASES OF THE RELATIONSHIP TO THAT PERSON
8975-270782-0028 THIS WISH WAS NO STRANGER TO HIM WHILE THE CHILD WAS STILL A SUCKLING THIS MAN WHO WAS UNHAPPY IN HIS CHOICE OF A WIFE OFTEN THOUGHT THAT IF THE LITTLE BEING THAT MEANT NOTHING TO HIM WOULD DIE HE WOULD AGAIN BE FREE AND WOULD MAKE BETTER USE OF HIS FREEDOM
8975-270782-0029 THAT SUCH WISHES AND SUCH DREAMS CANNOT OCCUR
8975-270782-0030 ONLY WISH TO WARN YOU THAT YOU ARE TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION NOT THE EXACT TERMS OF THE DREAM BUT THE MEANING THEREOF ACCORDING TO ITS INTERPRETATION IT MAY HAPPEN THAT THE MANIFEST DREAM OF THE DEATH OF SOME LOVED PERSON HAS ONLY MADE USE OF SOME FRIGHTFUL MASK
8975-270782-0031 THAT IT REALLY MEANS SOMETHING ENTIRELY DIFFERENT OR THAT THE LOVED PERSON SERVES AS A CONCEALING SUBSTITUTE FOR SOME OTHER BUT THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CALL FORTH ANOTHER MORE DIFFICULT QUESTION YOU SAY GRANTED THIS DEATH WISH WAS PRESENT AT SOME TIME OR OTHER
8975-270782-0032 AND IS SUBSTANTIATED BY MEMORY YET THIS IS NO EXPLANATION IT IS LONG OUTLIVED TO DAY IT CAN BE PRESENT ONLY IN THE UNCONSCIOUS AND AS AN EMPTY EMOTIONLESS MEMORY BUT NOT AS A STRONG IMPULSE WHY SHOULD IT BE RECALLED BY THE DREAM AT ALL THIS QUESTION IS JUSTIFIED
8975-270782-0033 IN ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT POINTS OF DREAM STUDY BUT I MUST REMAIN WITHIN THE BOUNDS OF OUR DISCUSSION AND PRACTICE RESTRAINT PREPARE YOURSELVES FOR THE TEMPORARY ABSTENTION LET US BE SATISFIED WITH THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL PROOF
8975-270782-0034 THAT THIS OUTLIVED WISH CAN BE SHOWN TO ACT AS A DREAM STIMULATOR AND LET US CONTINUE THE INVESTIGATION TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT OTHER EVIL WISHES ADMIT OF THE SAME DERIVATION OUT OF THE PAST LET US CONTINUE WITH THE REMOVAL OR DEATH WISH
8975-270782-0035 WHICH MOST FREQUENTLY CAN BE TRACED BACK TO THE UNBOUNDED EGOISM OF THE DREAMER
8975-270782-0036 AS OFTEN AS SOMEONE HAS BEEN IN OUR WAY IN LIFE AND HOW OFTEN MUST THIS HAPPEN IN THE COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS OF LIFE THE DREAM IS READY TO DO AWAY WITH HIM BE HE FATHER MOTHER BROTHER SISTER SPOUSE ET CETERA
8975-270782-0037 WE HAVE WONDERED SUFFICIENTLY OVER THIS EVIL TENDENCY OF HUMAN NATURE AND CERTAINLY WERE NOT PREDISPOSED TO ACCEPT THE AUTHENTICITY OF THIS RESULT OF DREAM INTERPRETATION WITHOUT QUESTION AFTER IT HAS ONCE BEEN SUGGESTED TO US TO SEEK THE ORIGIN OF SUCH WISHES IN THE PAST
8975-270782-0038 OR REAL REMNANTS THEREOF SHOW THEMSELVES FOR THE CHILD LOVES ITSELF FIRST AND LATER LEARNS TO LOVE OTHERS TO SACRIFICE SOMETHING OF ITS EGO FOR ANOTHER
8975-270782-0039 EVEN THOSE PERSONS WHOM THE CHILD SEEMS TO LOVE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING IT LOVES AT THE OUTSET BECAUSE IT HAS NEED OF THEM CANNOT DO WITHOUT THEM IN OTHERS WORDS OUT OF EGOISTICAL MOTIVES
8975-270782-0040 NOT UNTIL LATER DOES THE LOVE IMPULSE BECOME INDEPENDENT OF EGOISM IN BRIEF EGOISM HAS TAUGHT THE CHILD TO LOVE IN THIS CONNECTION IT IS INSTRUCTIVE TO COMPARE THE CHILD'S REGARD
8975-270782-0041 FOR HIS BROTHERS AND SISTERS WITH THAT WHICH HE HAS FOR HIS PARENTS
8975-270782-0042 OFTEN ENOUGH THIS ATTITUDE IS SUPERSEDED BY A MORE TENDER FEELING OR RATHER LET US SAY GLOSSED OVER BUT THE HOSTILE FEELING APPEARS REGULARLY TO HAVE BEEN THE EARLIER IT IS MOST NOTICEABLE IN CHILDREN OF FROM TWO AND ONE HALF
8975-270782-0043 TO FOUR OR FIVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN A NEW LITTLE BROTHER OR SISTER ARRIVES THE LATTER IS USUALLY RECEIVED IN A FAR FROM FRIENDLY MANNER EXPRESSIONS SUCH AS I DON'T WANT HIM LET THE STORK TAKE HIM AWAY AGAIN ARE VERY USUAL
8975-270782-0044 SUBSEQUENTLY EVERY OPPORTUNITY IS MADE USE OF TO DISPARAGE THE NEW ARRIVAL AND EVEN ATTEMPTS TO DO HIM BODILY HARM DIRECT ATTACKS ARE NOT UNHEARD OF
8975-270782-0045 IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS LESS THE CHILD LEARNS OF THE EXISTENCE OF THE RIVAL WITH INTENSE PSYCHIC ACTIVITY AND ACCOMMODATES HIMSELF TO THE NEW SITUATION IF THE DIFFERENCE IN AGE IS GREATER THE NEW CHILD MAY AWAKEN CERTAIN SYMPATHIES AS AN
8975-270782-0046 INTERESTING OBJECT AS A SORT OF LIVING DOLL AND IF THE DIFFERENCE IS EIGHT YEARS OR MORE MOTHERLY IMPULSES ESPECIALLY IN THE CASE OF GIRLS MAY COME INTO PLAY BUT TO BE TRUTHFUL WHEN WE DISCLOSE IN A DREAM THE WISH FOR THE DEATH OF A MOTHER OR SISTER
8975-270782-0047 WE NEED SELDOM FIND IT PUZZLING AND MAY TRACE ITS ORIGIN EASILY TO EARLY CHILDHOOD OFTEN ENOUGH ALSO TO THE PROPINQUITY OF LATER YEARS PROBABLY NO NURSERIES ARE FREE FROM MIGHTY CONFLICTS AMONG THE INHABITANTS
8975-270782-0048 THE MOTIVES ARE RIVALRY FOR THE LOVE OF THE PARENTS ARTICLES OWNED IN COMMON THE ROOM ITSELF THE HOSTILE IMPULSES ARE CALLED FORTH BY OLDER AS WELL AS YOUNGER BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0049 IF THERE IS ANYONE WHO HATES A YOUNG ENGLISH LADY MORE THAN DOES HER MOTHER IT IS HER ELDER SISTER THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT THIS SAYING HOWEVER THAT AROUSES OUR ANTIPATHY WE CAN AT A PINCH UNDERSTAND HATRED OF BROTHERS AND SISTERS
8975-270782-0050 AND RIVALRY AMONG THEM BUT HOW MAY FEELINGS OF HATRED FORCE THEIR WAY INTO THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DAUGHTER AND MOTHER PARENTS AND CHILDREN THIS RELATIONSHIP IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE MORE FAVORABLE EVEN WHEN LOOKED AT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0051 THIS IS IN ACCORD WITH OUR EXPECTATION WE FIND IT MUCH MORE OFFENSIVE FOR LOVE BETWEEN PARENTS AND CHILDREN TO BE LACKING THAN FOR LOVE BETWEEN BROTHERS AND SISTERS WE HAVE SO TO SPEAK MADE SOMETHING HOLY IN THE FIRST INSTANCE
8975-270782-0052 WHICH IN THE OTHER CASE WE PERMITTED TO REMAIN PROFANE
8975-270782-0053 THE FEELINGS BETWEEN PARENTS AND THEIR GROWN CHILDREN FAIL TO COME UP TO THE IDEAL ESTABLISHED BY SOCIETY HOW MUCH ENMITY EXISTS AND WOULD FIND EXPRESSION DID NOT ACCUMULATIONS OF PIETY AND OF TENDER IMPULSE HOLD THEM BACK THE MOTIVES FOR THIS ARE EVERYWHERE KNOWN
8975-270782-0054 AND DISCLOSE A TENDENCY TO SEPARATE THOSE OF THE SAME SEX DAUGHTER FROM MOTHER FATHER FROM SON THE DAUGHTER FINDS IN HER MOTHER THE AUTHORITY THAT HEMS IN HER WILL AND THAT IS ENTRUSTED WITH THE TASK OF CAUSING HER TO CARRY OUT
8975-270782-0055 THE ABSTENTION FROM SEXUAL LIBERTY WHICH SOCIETY DEMANDS IN CERTAIN CASES ALSO SHE IS THE RIVAL WHO OBJECTS TO BEING DISPLACED THE SAME TYPE OF THING OCCURS IN A MORE GLARING MANNER BETWEEN FATHER AND SON
8975-270782-0056 TO THE SON THE FATHER IS THE EMBODIMENT OF EVERY SOCIAL RESTRICTION BORNE WITH SUCH GREAT OPPOSITION THE FATHER BARS THE WAY TO FREEDOM OF WILL TO EARLY SEXUAL SATISFACTION
8975-270782-0057 TO THE ENJOYMENT THEREOF IMPATIENT WAITING FOR THE DEATH OF THE FATHER GROWS TO HEIGHTS APPROXIMATING TRAGEDY IN THE CASE OF A SUCCESSOR TO THE THRONE LESS STRAINED IS THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FATHER AND DAUGHTER MOTHER AND SON
8975-270782-0058 THE LATTER AFFORDS THE PUREST EXAMPLES OF AN UNALTERABLE TENDERNESS IN NO WAY DISTURBED BY EGOISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS WHY DO I SPEAK OF THESE THINGS SO BANAL AND SO WELL KNOWN
8975-270782-0059 BECAUSE THERE IS AN UNMISTAKABLE DISPOSITION TO DENY THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IN LIFE AND TO SET FORTH THE IDEAL DEMANDED BY SOCIETY AS A FULFILLED THING MUCH OFTENER THAN IT REALLY IS FULFILLED BUT IT IS PREFERABLE FOR PSYCHOLOGY TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
8975-270782-0060 RATHER THAN THAT THIS TASK SHOULD BE LEFT TO THE CYNIC IN ANY EVENT THIS DENIAL REFERS ONLY TO ACTUAL LIFE THE ARTS OF NARRATIVE AND DRAMATIC POETRY ARE STILL FREE TO MAKE USE OF THE MOTIVES THAT RESULT FROM A DISTURBANCE OF THIS IDEAL
8975-270782-0061 IT IS NOT TO BE WONDERED AT THAT IN THE CASE OF A LARGE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THE DREAM DISCLOSES THE WISH FOR THE REMOVAL OF THE PARENTS ESPECIALLY THE PARENT OF THE SAME SEX WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT IT IS ALSO PRESENT DURING WAKING HOURS
8975-270782-0062 AS IN THE CASE OF THE DREAMER'S SYMPATHY FOR HIS FATHER'S UNNECESSARY SUFFERINGS IN EXAMPLE THREE IT IS SELDOM THAT THE ENMITY ALONE CONTROLS THE RELATIONSHIP MUCH MORE OFTEN IT RECEDES BEHIND MORE TENDER IMPULSES
8975-270782-0063 BY WHICH IT IS SUPPRESSED AND MUST WAIT UNTIL A DREAM ISOLATES IT THAT WHICH THE DREAM SHOWS US IN ENLARGED FORM AS A RESULT OF SUCH ISOLATION SHRINKS TOGETHER AGAIN AFTER IT HAS BEEN PROPERLY DOCKETED IN ITS RELATION TO LIFE AS A RESULT OF OUR INTERPRETATION
8975-270782-0064 H SACHS BUT WE ALSO FIND THIS DREAM WISH IN PLACES WHERE IT HAS NO CONNECTION WITH LIFE AND WHERE THE ADULT IN HIS WAKING HOURS WOULD NEVER RECOGNIZE IT THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT THE DEEPEST AND MOST UNIFORM MOTIVE FOR BECOMING UNFRIENDLY
8975-270782-0065 ESPECIALLY BETWEEN PERSONS OF THE SAME SEX HAS ALREADY MADE ITS INFLUENCE FELT IN EARLIEST CHILDHOOD I MEAN THE LOVE RIVALRY WITH THE ESPECIAL EMPHASIS OF THE SEX CHARACTER THE SON EVEN AS A SMALL CHILD
8975-270782-0066 WHO IS A DISTURBING ELEMENT IN HER TENDER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER FATHER AND WHO OCCUPIES A POSITION THAT SHE COULD VERY WELL FILL HERSELF ONE LEARNS FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS TO WHAT EARLY YEARS THESE IDEAS EXTEND BACK
8975-270782-0067 IDEAS WHICH WE DESIGNATE AS THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX BECAUSE THIS MYTH REALIZES WITH A VERY SLIGHTLY WEAKENED EFFECT THE TWO EXTREME WISHES WHICH GROW OUT OF THE SITUATION OF THE SON TO KILL HIS FATHER AND TAKE HIS MOTHER TO WIFE
8975-270782-0068 I DO NOT WISH TO MAINTAIN THAT THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX COVERS ENTIRELY THE RELATION OF THE CHILD TO ITS PARENTS THIS RELATION CAN BE MUCH MORE COMPLICATED FURTHERMORE THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX IS MORE OR LESS WELL DEVELOPED IT MAY EVEN EXPERIENCE A REVERSAL
8975-270782-0069 BUT IT IS A CUSTOMARY AND VERY IMPORTANT FACTOR IN THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD AND ONE TENDS RATHER TO UNDERESTIMATE THAN TO OVERESTIMATE ITS INFLUENCE AND THE DEVELOPMENTS WHICH MAY FOLLOW FROM IT IN ADDITION
8975-270782-0070 CHILDREN FREQUENTLY REACT TO THE OEDIPUS IDEA THROUGH STIMULATION BY THE PARENTS WHO IN THE PLACING OF THEIR AFFECTION ARE OFTEN LED BY SEX DIFFERENCES SO THAT THE FATHER PREFERS THE DAUGHTER THE MOTHER THE SON
8975-270782-0071 AND THIS LOVE IS SUBSTITUTED FOR THE OUTWORN LOVE ONE CANNOT MAINTAIN THAT THE WORLD WAS VERY GRATEFUL TO PSYCHOANALYTIC RESEARCH FOR ITS DISCOVERY OF THE OEDIPUS COMPLEX ON THE CONTRARY IT CALLED FORTH THE STRONGEST RESISTANCE ON THE PART OF ADULTS
8975-270782-0072 AND PERSONS WHO HAD NEGLECTED TO TAKE PART IN DENYING THIS PROSCRIBED OR TABOOED FEELING RELATIONSHIP LATER MADE GOOD THE OMISSION BY TAKING ALL VALUE FROM THE COMPLEX THROUGH FALSE INTERPRETATIONS ACCORDING TO MY UNCHANGED CONVICTION
8975-270782-0073 CAST OUT OF LIFE WAS YIELDED UP TO POETRY AND GIVEN THE FREEST PLAY O RANK HAS SHOWN IN A CAREFUL STUDY HOW THIS VERY OEDIPUS COMPLEX HAS SUPPLIED DRAMATIC LITERATURE
8975-270782-0074 WITH A LARGE NUMBER OF MOTIVES IN UNENDING VARIATIONS DERIVATIONS AND DISGUISES ALSO IN DISTORTED FORMS SUCH AS WE RECOGNIZE TO BE THE WORK OF A CENSOR WE MAY ALSO ASCRIBE THIS OEDIPUS COMPLEX TO THOSE DREAMERS
8975-270782-0075 WHO WERE SO FORTUNATE AS TO ESCAPE IN LATER LIFE THESE CONFLICTS WITH THEIR PARENTS AND INTIMATELY ASSOCIATED THEREWITH WE FIND WHAT WE CALL THE CASTRATION COMPLEX THE REACTION TO SEXUAL INTIMIDATION OR RESTRICTION ASCRIBED TO THE FATHER
8975-270782-0076 BY APPLYING OUR FORMER RESEARCHES TO THE STUDY OF THE PSYCHIC LIFE OF THE CHILD WE MAY EXPECT TO FIND THAT THE ORIGIN OF OTHER FORBIDDEN DREAM WISHES OF EXCESSIVE SEXUAL IMPULSES MAY BE EXPLAINED IN THE SAME MANNER
8975-270782-0077 THUS WE ARE MOVED TO STUDY THE DEVELOPMENT OF SEX LIFE IN THE CHILD ALSO AND WE DISCOVER THE FOLLOWING FROM A NUMBER OF SOURCES IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS A MISTAKE TO DENY THAT THE CHILD HAS A SEXUAL LIFE AND TO TAKE IT FOR GRANTED
8975-270782-0078 THAT SEXUALITY COMMENCES WITH THE RIPENING OF THE GENITALS AT THE TIME OF PUBERTY ON THE CONTRARY THE CHILD HAS FROM THE VERY BEGINNING A SEXUAL LIFE RICH IN CONTENT AND DIFFERING IN NUMEROUS RESPECTS
8975-270782-0079 WHAT WE CALL PERVERSE IN THE LIFE OF THE ADULT DIFFERS FROM THE NORMAL IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS FIRST IN DISREGARD FOR THE DIVIDING LINE OF SPECIES THE GULF BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL SECOND
8975-270782-0080 BEING INSENSIBLE TO THE CONVENTIONAL FEELING OF DISGUST THIRD THE INCEST LIMITATION BEING PROHIBITED FROM SEEKING SEXUAL SATISFACTION WITH NEAR BLOOD RELATIONS FOURTH HOMOSEXUALITY AND FIFTH
8975-270782-0081 HE KNOWS NO UNBRIDGABLE CHASM BETWEEN MAN AND ANIMAL THE ARROGANCE WITH WHICH MAN DISTINGUISHES HIMSELF FROM THE ANIMAL IS A LATER ACQUISITION IN THE BEGINNING HE IS NOT DISGUSTED AT THE SIGHT OF EXCREMENT BUT SLOWLY LEARNS TO BE SO DISGUSTED
8975-270782-0082 UNDER THE PRESSURE OF EDUCATION HE LAYS NO SPECIAL STRESS ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SEXES RATHER ACCREDITS TO BOTH THE SAME GENITAL FORMATION
8975-270782-0083 TOWARD THOSE PERSONS CLOSEST TO HIM AND WHO ARE DEAR TO HIM FOR VARIOUS REASONS HIS PARENTS BROTHERS AND SISTERS NURSES AND FINALLY YOU MAY OBSERVE IN HIM THAT WHICH LATER BREAKS THROUGH AGAIN RAISED NOW TO A LOVE ATTRACTION
8975-270782-0084 POLYMORPHUS PERVERSE AND IF HE MAKES BUT SLIGHT USE OF ALL THESE IMPULSES IT IS ON THE ONE HAND BECAUSE OF THEIR LESSER INTENSITY AS COMPARED TO LATER LIFE AND ON THE OTHER HAND
8975-270782-0085 AND TO DISGUISE ANOTHER PART BY MISREPRESENTING ITS SEXUAL NATURE UNTIL THEY CAN DENY THE WHOLE BUSINESS THESE ARE OFTEN THE SAME PERSONS WHO DISCOURSE VIOLENTLY AGAINST ALL THE SEXUAL FAULTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0086 AND THEN AT THE WRITING TABLE DEFEND THE SEXUAL PURITY OF THE SAME CHILDREN WHERE CHILDREN ARE LEFT TO THEMSELVES OR ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CORRUPTION
8975-270782-0087 OF PERVERSE SEXUAL ACTIVITY TO BE SURE THE GROWN UPS ARE RIGHT IN LOOKING UPON THESE THINGS AS CHILDISH PERFORMANCES AS PLAY FOR THE CHILD IS NOT TO BE JUDGED AS MATURE AND ANSWERABLE EITHER BEFORE THE BAR OF CUSTOM OR BEFORE THE LAW
8975-270782-0088 BUT THESE THINGS DO EXIST THEY HAVE THEIR SIGNIFICANCE AS INDICATIONS OF INNATE CHARACTERISTICS AS WELL AS CAUSES AND FURTHERANCES OF LATER DEVELOPMENTS THEY GIVE US AN INSIGHT INTO CHILDHOOD SEX LIFE AND THEREBY INTO THE SEX LIFE OF MAN
8975-270782-0089 WHEN WE REDISCOVER IN THE BACKGROUND OF OUR DISTORTED DREAMS ALL THESE PERVERSE WISH IMPULSES IT MEANS ONLY THAT THE DREAM HAS IN THIS FIELD
8975-270782-0090 THOSE DIRECTED TOWARDS SEXUAL INTERCOURSE WITH PARENTS AND BROTHERS AND SISTERS YOU KNOW WHAT ANTIPATHY SOCIETY FEELS TOWARD SUCH INTERCOURSE OR AT LEAST PRETENDS TO FEEL AND WHAT WEIGHT IS LAID ON THE PROHIBITIONS DIRECTED AGAINST IT
8975-270782-0091 THE MOST MONSTROUS EFFORTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO EXPLAIN THIS FEAR OF INCEST SOME HAVE BELIEVED THAT IT IS DUE TO EVOLUTIONARY FORESIGHT ON THE PART OF NATURE WHICH IS PSYCHICALLY REPRESENTED BY THIS PROHIBITION BECAUSE INBREEDING WOULD DETERIORATE THE RACE CHARACTER
8975-270782-0092 OTHERS MAINTAINED THAT BECAUSE OF HAVING LIVED TOGETHER SINCE EARLY CHILDHOOD THE SEXUAL DESIRE IS DIVERTED FROM THE PERSONS UNDER CONSIDERATION IN BOTH CASES FURTHERMORE THE INCEST AVOIDANCE WOULD BE AUTOMATICALLY ASSURED
8975-270782-0093 AND MOST CUSTOMARY CHOICE AND THAT NOT UNTIL LATER IS THERE ANY RESISTANCE THE SOURCE OF WHICH PROBABLY IS TO BE FOUND IN THE INDIVIDUAL PSYCHOLOGY
8975-270782-0094 TOWARD THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE DREAM WE FOUND NOT ONLY THAT THE MATERIALS OF FORGOTTEN CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES ARE ACCESSIBLE TO THE DREAM
8975-270782-0095 WITH ALL ITS PECULIARITIES ITS EGOISM ITS INCESTUOUS LOVE CHOICE ET CETERA CONTINUES FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE DREAM IN THE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0096 INFANTILE SIDE OF PSYCHIC LIFE WHICH WE MAY FIND IN ACTION IN CHILDREN WHICH WE OVERLOOK PARTLY BECAUSE OF THE SLIGHTNESS OF ITS DIMENSIONS PARTLY BECAUSE IT IS LIGHTLY CONSIDERED SINCE WE DEMAND NO ETHICAL HEIGHTS OF THE CHILD
8975-270782-0097 SINCE THE DREAM REGRESSES TO THIS STAGE IT SEEMS TO HAVE MADE APPARENT THE EVIL THAT LIES IN US BUT IT IS ONLY A DECEPTIVE APPEARANCE BY WHICH WE HAVE ALLOWED OURSELVES TO BE FRIGHTENED WE ARE NOT SO EVIL AS WE MIGHT SUSPECT FROM THE INTERPRETATION OF DREAMS
8975-270782-0098 IF THE EVIL IMPULSES OF THE DREAM ARE MERELY INFANTILISM A RETURN TO THE BEGINNINGS OF OUR ETHICAL DEVELOPMENT SINCE THE DREAM SIMPLY MAKES CHILDREN OF US AGAIN IN THINKING AND IN FEELING WE NEED NOT BE ASHAMED OF THESE EVIL DREAMS IF WE ARE REASONABLE
8975-270782-0099 BUT BEING REASONABLE IS ONLY A PART OF PSYCHIC LIFE MANY THINGS ARE TAKING PLACE THERE THAT ARE NOT REASONABLE AND SO IT HAPPENS THAT WE ARE ASHAMED OF SUCH DREAMS AND UNREASONABLY WE TURN THEM OVER TO THE DREAM CENSORSHIP
8975-270782-0100 ARE ASHAMED AND ANGRY IF ONE OF THESE DREAMS HAS IN SOME UNUSUAL MANNER SUCCEEDED IN PENETRATING INTO CONSCIOUSNESS IN AN UNDISTORTED FORM
8975-270782-0101 AS WE WOULD BE IF WE UNDERSTOOD IT JUST THINK OF THE SCANDALIZED OPINION OF THE FINE OLD LADY ABOUT HER UNINTERPRETED DREAM OF SERVICES OF LOVE THE PROBLEM IS NOT YET SOLVED
8975-270782-0102 AND IT IS STILL POSSIBLE THAT UPON FURTHER STUDY OF THE EVIL IN THE DREAM WE SHALL COME TO SOME OTHER DECISION AND ARRIVE AT ANOTHER VALUATION OF HUMAN NATURE AS A RESULT OF THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION WE GRASP TWO FACTS
8975-270782-0103 WHICH HOWEVER DISCLOSE ONLY THE BEGINNINGS OF NEW RIDDLES NEW DOUBTS FIRST THE REGRESSION OF DREAM WORK IS NOT ONLY FORMAL IT IS ALSO OF GREATER IMPORT IT NOT ONLY TRANSLATES OUR THOUGHTS INTO A PRIMITIVE FORM OF EXPRESSION
8975-270782-0104 BUT IT REAWAKENS THE PECULIARITIES OF OUR PRIMITIVE PSYCHIC LIFE THE ANCIENT PREDOMINANCE OF THE EGO THE EARLIEST IMPULSES OF OUR SEXUAL LIFE EVEN OUR OLD INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
8975-270782-0105 UNCONSCIOUS IS NO LONGER A NAME FOR WHAT IS AT THAT TIME LATENT THE UNCONSCIOUS IS AN ESPECIAL PSYCHIC REALM WITH WISH IMPULSES OF ITS OWN WITH ITS OWN METHOD OF EXPRESSION AND WITH A PSYCHIC MECHANISM PECULIAR TO ITSELF
8975-270782-0106 BUT THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHTS WHICH WE HAVE SOLVED BY MEANS OF THE DREAM INTERPRETATION ARE NOT OF THIS REALM THEY ARE MUCH MORE NEARLY THE SAME AS ANY WE MAY HAVE THOUGHT IN OUR WAKING HOURS STILL THEY ARE UNCONSCIOUS
8975-270782-0107 HOW DOES ONE SOLVE THIS CONTRADICTION WE BEGIN TO SEE THAT A DISTINCTION MUST BE MADE SOMETHING THAT ORIGINATES IN OUR CONSCIOUS LIFE AND THAT SHARES ITS CHARACTERISTICS
8975-270782-0108 THE DAY REMNANTS COMBINES IN THE DREAM FABRICATION
8975-270782-0109 BETWEEN THESE TWO PARTS THE DREAM WORK COMPLETES ITSELF THE INFLUENCING OF THE DAY REMNANTS BY THE UNCONSCIOUS NECESSITATES REGRESSION THIS IS THE DEEPEST INSIGHT INTO THE NATURE OF THE DREAM
8975-270782-0110 THAT WE ARE ABLE TO ATTAIN WITHOUT HAVING SEARCHED THROUGH FURTHER PSYCHIC REALMS THE TIME WILL SOON COME HOWEVER WHEN WE SHALL CLOTHE THE UNCONSCIOUS CHARACTER OF THE LATENT DREAM THOUGHT WITH ANOTHER NAME
8975-270782-0111 WHICH SHALL DIFFERENTIATE IT FROM THE UNCONSCIOUS OUT OF THE REALM OF THE INFANTILE WE MAY TO BE SURE PROPOUND THE QUESTION WHAT FORCES THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ACTIVITY DURING SLEEP TO SUCH REGRESSION
8975-270782-0112 WHY DO NOT THE SLEEP DISTURBING PSYCHIC STIMULI DO THE JOB WITHOUT IT AND IF THEY MUST BECAUSE OF THE DREAM CENSORSHIP DISGUISE THEMSELVES THROUGH OLD FORMS OF EXPRESSION WHICH ARE NO LONGER COMPREHENSIBLE
8975-270782-0113 WHAT IS THE USE OF GIVING NEW LIFE TO OLD LONG OUTGROWN PSYCHIC STIMULI WISHES AND CHARACTER TYPES THAT IS WHY THE MATERIAL REGRESSION IN ADDITION TO THE FORMAL THE ONLY SATISFACTORY ANSWER WOULD BE THIS
8975-270782-0114 THAT ONLY IN THIS MANNER CAN A DREAM BE BUILT UP
909-131041-0000 THE MODE OF APPOINTMENT OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE OF THE UNITED STATES IS ALMOST THE ONLY PART OF THE SYSTEM OF ANY CONSEQUENCE WHICH HAS ESCAPED WITHOUT SEVERE CENSURE OR WHICH HAS RECEIVED THE SLIGHTEST MARK OF APPROBATION FROM ITS OPPONENTS
909-131041-0001 THE MOST PLAUSIBLE OF THESE WHO HAS APPEARED IN PRINT
909-131041-0002 AND HESITATE NOT TO AFFIRM THAT IF THE MANNER OF IT BE NOT PERFECT IT IS AT LEAST EXCELLENT
909-131041-0003 BUT TO MEN CHOSEN BY THE PEOPLE FOR THE SPECIAL PURPOSE AND AT THE PARTICULAR CONJUNCTURE IT WAS EQUALLY DESIRABLE THAT THE IMMEDIATE ELECTION SHOULD BE MADE BY MEN MOST CAPABLE OF ANALYZING THE QUALITIES ADAPTED TO THE STATION
909-131041-0004 AND ACTING UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES FAVORABLE TO DELIBERATION AND TO A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF ALL THE REASONS AND INDUCEMENTS WHICH WERE PROPER TO GOVERN THEIR CHOICE A SMALL NUMBER OF PERSONS
909-131041-0005 SELECTED BY THEIR FELLOW CITIZENS FROM THE GENERAL MASS WILL BE MOST LIKELY TO POSSESS THE INFORMATION AND DISCERNMENT REQUISITE TO SUCH COMPLICATED INVESTIGATIONS
909-131041-0006 BUT THE PRECAUTIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN SO HAPPILY CONCERTED IN THE SYSTEM UNDER CONSIDERATION PROMISE AN EFFECTUAL SECURITY AGAINST THIS MISCHIEF THE CHOICE OF SEVERAL TO FORM AN INTERMEDIATE BODY OF ELECTORS
909-131041-0007 WILL BE MUCH LESS APT TO CONVULSE THE COMMUNITY WITH ANY EXTRAORDINARY OR VIOLENT MOVEMENTS THAN THE CHOICE OF ONE WHO WAS HIMSELF TO BE THE FINAL OBJECT OF THE PUBLIC WISHES AND AS THE ELECTORS CHOSEN IN EACH STATE
909-131041-0008 ARE TO ASSEMBLE AND VOTE IN THE STATE IN WHICH THEY ARE CHOSEN THIS DETACHED AND DIVIDED SITUATION WILL EXPOSE THEM MUCH LESS TO HEATS AND FERMENTS WHICH MIGHT BE COMMUNICATED FROM THEM TO THE PEOPLE THAN IF THEY WERE ALL TO BE CONVENED
909-131041-0009 AT ONE TIME IN ONE PLACE NOTHING WAS MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THAT EVERY PRACTICABLE OBSTACLE SHOULD BE OPPOSED TO CABAL INTRIGUE AND CORRUPTION
909-131041-0010 THESE MOST DEADLY ADVERSARIES OF REPUBLICAN GOVERNMENT MIGHT NATURALLY HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MAKE THEIR APPROACHES FROM MORE THAN ONE QUARTER BUT CHIEFLY FROM THE DESIRE IN FOREIGN POWERS TO GAIN AN IMPROPER ASCENDANT IN OUR COUNCILS
909-131041-0011 HOW COULD THEY BETTER GRATIFY THIS THAN BY RAISING A CREATURE OF THEIR OWN TO THE CHIEF MAGISTRACY OF THE UNION BUT THE CONVENTION HAVE GUARDED AGAINST ALL DANGER OF THIS SORT WITH THE MOST PROVIDENT AND JUDICIOUS ATTENTION
909-131041-0012 THEY HAVE NOT MADE THE APPOINTMENT OF THE PRESIDENT TO DEPEND ON ANY PREEXISTING BODIES OF MEN WHO MIGHT BE TAMPERED WITH BEFOREHAND TO PROSTITUTE THEIR VOTES BUT THEY HAVE REFERRED IT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE TO AN IMMEDIATE ACT OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA
909-131041-0013 TO BE EXERTED IN THE CHOICE OF PERSONS FOR THE TEMPORARY AND SOLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE APPOINTMENT AND THEY HAVE EXCLUDED FROM ELIGIBILITY TO THIS TRUST ALL THOSE WHO FROM SITUATION MIGHT BE SUSPECTED OF TOO GREAT DEVOTION TO THE PRESIDENT IN OFFICE
909-131041-0014 NO SENATOR REPRESENTATIVE OR OTHER PERSON HOLDING A PLACE OF TRUST OR PROFIT UNDER THE UNITED STATES CAN BE OF THE NUMBERS OF THE ELECTORS THUS WITHOUT CORRUPTING THE BODY OF THE PEOPLE THE IMMEDIATE AGENTS IN THE ELECTION
909-131041-0015 WILL AT LEAST ENTER UPON THE TASK FREE FROM ANY SINISTER BIAS THEIR TRANSIENT EXISTENCE AND THEIR DETACHED SITUATION ALREADY TAKEN NOTICE OF AFFORD A SATISFACTORY PROSPECT OF THEIR CONTINUING SO TO THE CONCLUSION OF IT
909-131041-0016 THE BUSINESS OF CORRUPTION WHEN IT IS TO EMBRACE SO CONSIDERABLE A NUMBER OF MEN REQUIRES TIME AS WELL AS MEANS NOR WOULD IT BE FOUND EASY SUDDENLY TO EMBARK THEM DISPERSED AS THEY WOULD BE OVER THIRTEEN STATES
909-131041-0017 IN ANY COMBINATIONS FOUNDED UPON MOTIVES WHICH THOUGH THEY COULD NOT PROPERLY BE DENOMINATED CORRUPT MIGHT YET BE OF A NATURE TO MISLEAD THEM FROM THEIR DUTY
909-131041-0018 ON ALL BUT THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES
909-131041-0019 THIS ADVANTAGE WILL ALSO BE SECURED BY MAKING HIS RE ELECTION TO DEPEND ON A SPECIAL BODY OF REPRESENTATIVES DEPUTED BY THE SOCIETY FOR THE SINGLE PURPOSE OF MAKING THE IMPORTANT CHOICE ALL THESE ADVANTAGES WILL HAPPILY COMBINE IN THE PLAN DEVISED BY THE CONVENTION
909-131041-0020 WHICH IS THAT THE PEOPLE OF EACH STATE SHALL CHOOSE A NUMBER OF PERSONS AS ELECTORS EQUAL TO THE NUMBER OF SENATORS AND REPRESENTATIVES OF SUCH STATE IN THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT WHO SHALL ASSEMBLE WITHIN THE STATE AND VOTE FOR SOME FIT PERSON AS PRESIDENT
909-131041-0021 AND THE PERSON WHO MAY HAPPEN TO HAVE A MAJORITY OF THE WHOLE NUMBER OF VOTES WILL BE THE PRESIDENT BUT AS A MAJORITY OF THE VOTES MIGHT NOT ALWAYS HAPPEN TO CENTRE IN ONE MAN AND AS IT MIGHT BE UNSAFE TO PERMIT LESS THAN A MAJORITY TO BE CONCLUSIVE
909-131041-0022 IT IS PROVIDED THAT IN SUCH A CONTINGENCY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES SHALL SELECT OUT OF THE CANDIDATES WHO SHALL HAVE THE FIVE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTES THE MAN WHO IN THEIR OPINION MAY BE BEST QUALIFIED FOR THE OFFICE
909-131041-0023 THE PROCESS OF ELECTION AFFORDS A MORAL CERTAINTY THAT THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT WILL NEVER FALL TO THE LOT OF ANY MAN WHO IS NOT IN AN EMINENT DEGREE ENDOWED WITH THE REQUISITE QUALIFICATIONS TALENTS FOR LOW INTRIGUE
909-131041-0024 AND THE LITTLE ARTS OF POPULARITY MAY ALONE SUFFICE TO ELEVATE A MAN TO THE FIRST HONORS IN A SINGLE STATE BUT IT WILL REQUIRE OTHER TALENTS AND A DIFFERENT KIND OF MERIT TO ESTABLISH HIM IN THE ESTEEM AND CONFIDENCE OF THE WHOLE UNION
909-131041-0025 OR OF SO CONSIDERABLE A PORTION OF IT AS WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAKE HIM A SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE FOR THE DISTINGUISHED OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IT WILL NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY THAT THERE WILL BE A CONSTANT PROBABILITY OF SEEING THE STATION FILLED BY CHARACTERS
909-131041-0026 PRE EMINENT FOR ABILITY AND VIRTUE AND THIS WILL BE THOUGHT NO INCONSIDERABLE RECOMMENDATION OF THE CONSTITUTION BY THOSE WHO ARE ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE SHARE WHICH THE EXECUTIVE IN EVERY GOVERNMENT MUST NECESSARILY HAVE IN ITS GOOD OR ILL ADMINISTRATION
909-131041-0027 THOUGH WE CANNOT ACQUIESCE IN THE POLITICAL HERESY OF THE POET WHO SAYS FOR FORMS OF GOVERNMENT LET FOOLS CONTEST THAT WHICH IS BEST ADMINISTERED IS BEST YET WE MAY SAFELY PRONOUNCE
909-131041-0028 THAT THE TRUE TEST OF A GOOD GOVERNMENT IS ITS APTITUDE AND TENDENCY TO PRODUCE A GOOD ADMINISTRATION THE VICE PRESIDENT IS TO BE CHOSEN IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THE PRESIDENT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE SENATE IS TO DO IN RESPECT TO THE FORMER
909-131041-0029 WHAT IS TO BE DONE BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN RESPECT TO THE LATTER THE APPOINTMENT OF AN EXTRAORDINARY PERSON AS VICE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN OBJECTED TO AS SUPERFLUOUS IF NOT MISCHIEVOUS
909-131041-0030 THE OTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT AS THE VICE PRESIDENT MAY OCCASIONALLY BECOME A SUBSTITUTE FOR THE PRESIDENT IN THE SUPREME EXECUTIVE MAGISTRACY ALL THE REASONS WHICH RECOMMEND THE MODE OF ELECTION PRESCRIBED FOR THE ONE
909-131041-0031 APPLY WITH GREAT IF NOT WITH EQUAL FORCE TO THE MANNER OF APPOINTING THE OTHER IT IS REMARKABLE THAT IN THIS AS IN MOST OTHER INSTANCES THE OBJECTION WHICH IS MADE WOULD LIE AGAINST THE CONSTITUTION OF THIS STATE WE HAVE A LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR
909-131044-0000 THE DURATION IN OFFICE OF THE EXECUTIVE FROM THE NEW YORK PACKET
909-131044-0001 AND TO THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ADOPTED UNDER HIS AUSPICES WITH REGARD TO THE FIRST IT MUST BE EVIDENT THAT THE LONGER THE DURATION IN OFFICE THE GREATER WILL BE THE PROBABILITY OF OBTAINING SO IMPORTANT AN ADVANTAGE
909-131044-0002 IT IS A GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN NATURE THAT A MAN WILL BE INTERESTED IN WHATEVER HE POSSESSES IN PROPORTION TO THE FIRMNESS OR PRECARIOUSNESS OF THE TENURE BY WHICH HE HOLDS IT
909-131044-0003 AND OF COURSE WILL BE WILLING TO RISK MORE FOR THE SAKE OF THE ONE THAN FOR THE SAKE OF THE OTHER THIS REMARK IS NOT LESS APPLICABLE TO A POLITICAL PRIVILEGE OR HONOR OR TRUST THAN TO ANY ARTICLE OF ORDINARY PROPERTY
909-131044-0004 THE INFERENCE FROM IT IS THAT A MAN ACTING IN THE CAPACITY OF CHIEF MAGISTRATE UNDER A CONSCIOUSNESS THAT IN A VERY SHORT TIME HE MUST LAY DOWN HIS OFFICE WILL BE APT TO FEEL HIMSELF TOO LITTLE INTERESTED IN IT TO HAZARD ANY MATERIAL CENSURE OR PERPLEXITY
909-131044-0005 FROM THE INDEPENDENT EXERTION OF HIS POWERS OR FROM ENCOUNTERING THE ILL HUMORS HOWEVER TRANSIENT WHICH MAY HAPPEN TO PREVAIL EITHER IN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF OR EVEN IN A PREDOMINANT FACTION IN THE LEGISLATIVE BODY
909-131044-0006 IF THE CASE SHOULD ONLY BE THAT HE MIGHT LAY IT DOWN UNLESS CONTINUED BY A NEW CHOICE AND IF HE SHOULD BE DESIROUS OF BEING CONTINUED HIS WISHES CONSPIRING WITH HIS FEARS WOULD TEND STILL MORE POWERFULLY TO CORRUPT HIS INTEGRITY
909-131044-0007 EITHER IN THE COMMUNITY OR IN THE LEGISLATURE AS ITS BEST RECOMMENDATION BUT SUCH MEN ENTERTAIN VERY CRUDE NOTIONS AS WELL OF THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH GOVERNMENT WAS INSTITUTED AS OF THE TRUE MEANS BY WHICH THE PUBLIC HAPPINESS MAY BE PROMOTED
909-131044-0008 THE REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLE DEMANDS THAT THE DELIBERATE SENSE OF THE COMMUNITY SHOULD GOVERN THE CONDUCT OF THOSE TO WHOM THEY INTRUST THE MANAGEMENT OF THEIR AFFAIRS BUT IT DOES NOT REQUIRE AN UNQUALIFIED COMPLAISANCE TO EVERY SUDDEN BREEZE OF PASSION
909-131044-0009 OR TO EVERY TRANSIENT IMPULSE WHICH THE PEOPLE MAY RECEIVE FROM THE ARTS OF MEN WHO FLATTER THEIR PREJUDICES TO BETRAY THEIR INTERESTS IT IS A JUST OBSERVATION THAT THE PEOPLE COMMONLY INTEND THE PUBLIC GOOD
909-131044-0010 THIS OFTEN APPLIES TO THEIR VERY ERRORS BUT THEIR GOOD SENSE WOULD DESPISE THE ADULATOR WHO SHOULD PRETEND THAT THEY ALWAYS REASON RIGHT ABOUT THE MEANS OF PROMOTING IT THEY KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT THEY SOMETIMES ERR AND THE WONDER IS
909-131044-0011 THAT THEY SO SELDOM ERR AS THEY DO BESET AS THEY CONTINUALLY ARE BY THE WILES OF PARASITES AND SYCOPHANTS BY THE SNARES OF THE AMBITIOUS THE AVARICIOUS THE DESPERATE BY THE ARTIFICES
909-131044-0012 OF MEN WHO POSSESS THEIR CONFIDENCE MORE THAN THEY DESERVE IT AND OF THOSE WHO SEEK TO POSSESS RATHER THAN TO DESERVE IT WHEN OCCASIONS PRESENT THEMSELVES IN WHICH THE INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THEIR INCLINATIONS
909-131044-0013 IN WHICH A CONDUCT OF THIS KIND HAS SAVED THE PEOPLE FROM VERY FATAL CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OWN MISTAKES AND HAS PROCURED LASTING MONUMENTS OF THEIR GRATITUDE TO THE MEN WHO HAD COURAGE AND MAGNANIMITY ENOUGH TO SERVE THEM AT THE PERIL OF THEIR DISPLEASURE
909-131044-0014 BUT HOWEVER INCLINED WE MIGHT BE TO INSIST UPON AN UNBOUNDED COMPLAISANCE IN THE EXECUTIVE TO THE INCLINATIONS OF THE PEOPLE WE CAN WITH NO PROPRIETY CONTEND FOR A LIKE COMPLAISANCE TO THE HUMORS OF THE LEGISLATURE
909-131044-0015 THE LATTER MAY SOMETIMES STAND IN OPPOSITION TO THE FORMER AND AT OTHER TIMES THE PEOPLE MAY BE ENTIRELY NEUTRAL IN EITHER SUPPOSITION IT IS CERTAINLY DESIRABLE THAT THE EXECUTIVE SHOULD BE IN A SITUATION TO DARE TO ACT HIS OWN OPINION WITH VIGOR AND DECISION
909-131044-0016 THE SAME RULE WHICH TEACHES THE PROPRIETY OF A PARTITION BETWEEN THE VARIOUS BRANCHES OF POWER TEACHES US LIKEWISE THAT THIS PARTITION OUGHT TO BE SO CONTRIVED AS TO RENDER THE ONE INDEPENDENT OF THE OTHER
909-131044-0017 TO WHAT PURPOSE SEPARATE THE EXECUTIVE OR THE JUDICIARY FROM THE LEGISLATIVE IF BOTH THE EXECUTIVE AND THE JUDICIARY ARE SO CONSTITUTED AS TO BE AT THE ABSOLUTE DEVOTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE SUCH A SEPARATION MUST BE MERELY NOMINAL
909-131044-0018 AND ANOTHER TO BE DEPENDENT ON THE LEGISLATIVE BODY THE FIRST COMPORTS WITH THE LAST VIOLATES THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF GOOD GOVERNMENT AND WHATEVER MAY BE THE FORMS OF THE CONSTITUTION UNITES ALL POWER IN THE SAME HANDS
909-131044-0019 THE TENDENCY OF THE LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY TO ABSORB EVERY OTHER HAS BEEN FULLY DISPLAYED AND ILLUSTRATED BY EXAMPLES IN SOME PRECEDING NUMBERS IN GOVERNMENTS PURELY REPUBLICAN THIS TENDENCY IS ALMOST IRRESISTIBLE THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE
909-131044-0020 THEY OFTEN APPEAR DISPOSED TO EXERT AN IMPERIOUS CONTROL OVER THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND AS THEY COMMONLY HAVE THE PEOPLE ON THEIR SIDE
909-131044-0021 THEY ALWAYS ACT WITH SUCH MOMENTUM AS TO MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION IT MAY PERHAPS BE ASKED HOW THE SHORTNESS OF THE DURATION IN OFFICE
909-131044-0022 CAN AFFECT THE INDEPENDENCE OF THE EXECUTIVE ON THE LEGISLATURE UNLESS THE ONE WERE POSSESSED OF THE POWER OF APPOINTING OR DISPLACING THE OTHER ONE ANSWER TO THIS INQUIRY MAY BE DRAWN FROM THE PRINCIPLE ALREADY REMARKED
909-131044-0023 THOUGH NOT MORE CONCLUSIVE WILL RESULT FROM THE CONSIDERATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY OVER THE PEOPLE WHICH MIGHT BE EMPLOYED TO PREVENT THE RE ELECTION OF A MAN WHO BY AN UPRIGHT RESISTANCE TO ANY SINISTER PROJECT OF THAT BODY SHOULD HAVE MADE HIMSELF
909-131044-0024 OBNOXIOUS TO ITS RESENTMENT IT MAY BE ASKED ALSO WHETHER A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WOULD ANSWER THE END PROPOSED AND IF IT WOULD NOT WHETHER A LESS PERIOD WHICH WOULD AT LEAST BE RECOMMENDED BY GREATER SECURITY AGAINST AMBITIOUS DESIGNS
909-131044-0025 WOULD NOT FOR THAT REASON BE PREFERABLE TO A LONGER PERIOD WHICH WAS AT THE SAME TIME TOO SHORT FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSPIRING THE DESIRED FIRMNESS AND INDEPENDENCE OF THE MAGISTRATE IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED THAT A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS OR ANY OTHER LIMITED DURATION
909-131044-0026 THERE WOULD ALWAYS BE A CONSIDERABLE INTERVAL IN WHICH THE PROSPECT OF ANNIHILATION WOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY REMOTE NOT TO HAVE AN IMPROPER EFFECT UPON THE CONDUCT OF A MAN INDUED WITH A TOLERABLE PORTION OF FORTITUDE
909-131044-0027 AND IN WHICH HE MIGHT REASONABLY PROMISE HIMSELF THAT THERE WOULD BE TIME ENOUGH BEFORE IT ARRIVED TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY SENSIBLE OF THE PROPRIETY OF THE MEASURES HE MIGHT INCLINE TO PURSUE THOUGH IT BE PROBABLE THAT AS HE APPROACHED THE MOMENT
909-131044-0028 OF ESTABLISHING HIMSELF IN THE ESTEEM AND GOOD WILL OF HIS CONSTITUENTS HE MIGHT THEN HAZARD WITH SAFETY IN PROPORTION TO THE PROOFS HE HAD GIVEN OF HIS WISDOM AND INTEGRITY AND TO THE TITLE HE HAD ACQUIRED TO THE RESPECT AND ATTACHMENT OF HIS FELLOW CITIZENS
909-131044-0029 AS ON THE ONE HAND A DURATION OF FOUR YEARS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE FIRMNESS OF THE EXECUTIVE IN A SUFFICIENT DEGREE TO RENDER IT A VERY VALUABLE INGREDIENT IN THE COMPOSITION SO ON THE OTHER IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY ALARM FOR THE PUBLIC LIBERTY
909-131044-0030 IF A BRITISH HOUSE OF COMMONS FROM THE MOST FEEBLE BEGINNINGS FROM THE MERE POWER OF ASSENTING OR DISAGREEING TO THE IMPOSITION OF A NEW TAX
909-131044-0031 HAVE BY RAPID STRIDES REDUCED THE PREROGATIVES OF THE CROWN AND THE PRIVILEGES OF THE NOBILITY WITHIN THE LIMITS THEY CONCEIVED TO BE COMPATIBLE WITH THE PRINCIPLES OF A FREE GOVERNMENT WHILE THEY RAISED THEMSELVES TO THE RANK AND CONSEQUENCE OF A COEQUAL BRANCH OF THE LEGISLATURE
909-131044-0032 ALL THE ANCIENT ESTABLISHMENTS AS WELL IN THE CHURCH AS STATE IF THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE ON A RECENT OCCASION TO MAKE THE MONARCH TREMBLE AT THE PROSPECT
909-131044-0033 WHAT BUT THAT HE MIGHT BE UNEQUAL TO THE TASK WHICH THE CONSTITUTION ASSIGNS HIM I SHALL ONLY ADD THAT IF HIS DURATION BE SUCH AS TO LEAVE A DOUBT OF HIS FIRMNESS THAT DOUBT IS INCONSISTENT WITH A JEALOUSY OF HIS ENCROACHMENTS
909-131045-0000 THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT IN ITS LARGEST SENSE COMPREHENDS ALL THE OPERATIONS OF THE BODY POLITIC WHETHER LEGISLATIVE EXECUTIVE OR JUDICIARY BUT IN ITS MOST USUAL AND PERHAPS ITS MOST PRECISE SIGNIFICATION
909-131045-0001 IT IS LIMITED TO EXECUTIVE DETAILS AND FALLS PECULIARLY WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT THE ACTUAL CONDUCT OF FOREIGN NEGOTIATIONS THE PREPARATORY PLANS OF FINANCE
909-131045-0002 THE APPLICATION AND DISBURSEMENT OF THE PUBLIC MONEYS IN CONFORMITY TO THE GENERAL APPROPRIATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE ARMY AND NAVY THE DIRECTIONS OF THE OPERATIONS OF WAR
909-131045-0003 THESE AND OTHER MATTERS OF A LIKE NATURE CONSTITUTE WHAT SEEMS TO BE MOST PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD BY THE ADMINISTRATION OF GOVERNMENT THE PERSONS THEREFORE TO WHOSE IMMEDIATE MANAGEMENT THESE DIFFERENT MATTERS ARE COMMITTED
909-131045-0004 OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS THE ASSISTANTS OR DEPUTIES OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AND ON THIS ACCOUNT THEY OUGHT TO DERIVE THEIR OFFICES FROM HIS APPOINTMENT AT LEAST FROM HIS NOMINATION AND OUGHT TO BE SUBJECT TO HIS SUPERINTENDENCE
909-131045-0005 THIS VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WILL AT ONCE SUGGEST TO US THE INTIMATE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE DURATION OF THE EXECUTIVE MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE AND THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION TO REVERSE AND UNDO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE BY A PREDECESSOR
909-131045-0006 THE PERSON SUBSTITUTED IS WARRANTED IN SUPPOSING THAT THE DISMISSION OF HIS PREDECESSOR HAS PROCEEDED FROM A DISLIKE TO HIS MEASURES AND THAT THE LESS HE RESEMBLES HIM THE MORE HE WILL RECOMMEND HIMSELF TO THE FAVOR OF HIS CONSTITUENTS
909-131045-0007 THESE CONSIDERATIONS AND THE INFLUENCE OF PERSONAL CONFIDENCES AND ATTACHMENTS WOULD BE LIKELY TO INDUCE EVERY NEW PRESIDENT TO PROMOTE A CHANGE OF MEN TO FILL THE SUBORDINATE STATIONS
909-131045-0008 AND THESE CAUSES TOGETHER COULD NOT FAIL TO OCCASION A DISGRACEFUL AND RUINOUS MUTABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH A POSITIVE DURATION OF CONSIDERABLE EXTENT I CONNECT THE CIRCUMSTANCE OF RE ELIGIBILITY
909-131045-0009 THE FIRST IS NECESSARY TO GIVE TO THE OFFICER HIMSELF THE INCLINATION AND THE RESOLUTION TO ACT HIS PART WELL AND TO THE COMMUNITY TIME AND LEISURE TO OBSERVE THE TENDENCY OF HIS MEASURES AND THENCE TO FORM AN EXPERIMENTAL ESTIMATE OF THEIR MERITS
909-131045-0010 THE LAST IS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY SEE REASON TO APPROVE OF HIS CONDUCT TO CONTINUE HIM IN HIS STATION IN ORDER TO PROLONG THE UTILITY OF HIS TALENTS AND VIRTUES AND TO SECURE TO THE GOVERNMENT THE ADVANTAGE OF PERMANENCY
909-131045-0011 IN A WISE SYSTEM OF ADMINISTRATION NOTHING APPEARS MORE PLAUSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT NOR MORE ILL FOUNDED UPON CLOSE INSPECTION THAN A SCHEME WHICH IN RELATION TO THE PRESENT POINT HAS HAD SOME RESPECTABLE ADVOCATES I MEAN
909-131045-0012 THAT OF CONTINUING THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE IN OFFICE FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND THEN EXCLUDING HIM FROM IT EITHER FOR A LIMITED PERIOD OR FOREVER AFTER THIS EXCLUSION WHETHER TEMPORARY OR PERPETUAL WOULD HAVE NEARLY THE SAME EFFECTS
909-131045-0013 WHEN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS THAT THE ADVANTAGES OF THE STATION WITH WHICH IT WAS CONNECTED MUST BE RELINQUISHED AT A DETERMINATE PERIOD THAN WHEN THEY WERE PERMITTED TO ENTERTAIN A HOPE OF OBTAINING
909-131045-0014 IS TO MAKE THEIR INTERESTS COINCIDE WITH THEIR DUTY EVEN THE LOVE OF FAME THE RULING PASSION OF THE NOBLEST MINDS WHICH WOULD PROMPT A MAN TO PLAN AND UNDERTAKE EXTENSIVE AND ARDUOUS ENTERPRISES FOR THE PUBLIC BENEFIT
909-131045-0015 AND MUST COMMIT THAT TOGETHER WITH HIS OWN REPUTATION TO HANDS WHICH MIGHT BE UNEQUAL OR UNFRIENDLY TO THE TASK THE MOST TO BE EXPECTED FROM THE GENERALITY OF MEN IN SUCH A SITUATION IS THE NEGATIVE MERIT OF NOT DOING HARM
909-131045-0016 INSTEAD OF THE POSITIVE MERIT OF DOING GOOD ANOTHER ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE TEMPTATION TO SORDID VIEWS TO PECULATION AND IN SOME INSTANCES TO USURPATION
909-131045-0017 AN AVARICIOUS MAN WHO MIGHT HAPPEN TO FILL THE OFFICE LOOKING FORWARD TO A TIME WHEN HE MUST AT ALL EVENTS YIELD UP THE EMOLUMENTS HE ENJOYED WOULD FEEL A PROPENSITY NOT EASY TO BE RESISTED BY SUCH A MAN
909-131045-0018 TO MAKE THE BEST USE OF THE OPPORTUNITY HE ENJOYED WHILE IT LASTED AND MIGHT NOT SCRUPLE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MOST CORRUPT EXPEDIENTS TO MAKE THE HARVEST AS ABUNDANT AS IT WAS TRANSITORY THOUGH THE SAME MAN PROBABLY WITH A DIFFERENT PROSPECT BEFORE HIM
909-131045-0019 MIGHT CONTENT HIMSELF WITH THE REGULAR PERQUISITES OF HIS SITUATION AND MIGHT EVEN BE UNWILLING TO RISK THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN ABUSE OF HIS OPPORTUNITIES HIS AVARICE MIGHT BE A GUARD UPON HIS AVARICE
909-131045-0020 ADD TO THIS THAT THE SAME MAN MIGHT BE VAIN OR AMBITIOUS AS WELL AS AVARICIOUS AND IF HE COULD EXPECT TO PROLONG HIS HONORS BY HIS GOOD CONDUCT HE MIGHT HESITATE TO SACRIFICE HIS APPETITE FOR THEM TO HIS APPETITE FOR GAIN
909-131045-0021 BUT WITH THE PROSPECT BEFORE HIM OF APPROACHING AN INEVITABLE ANNIHILATION HIS AVARICE WOULD BE LIKELY TO GET THE VICTORY OVER HIS CAUTION HIS VANITY OR HIS AMBITION AN AMBITIOUS MAN TOO
909-131045-0022 WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF SEATED ON THE SUMMIT OF HIS COUNTRY'S HONORS WHEN HE LOOKED FORWARD TO THE TIME AT WHICH HE MUST DESCEND FROM THE EXALTED EMINENCE FOR EVER AND REFLECTED THAT NO EXERTION OF MERIT ON HIS PART COULD SAVE HIM FROM THE UNWELCOME REVERSE
909-131045-0023 AND SIGHING FOR A PLACE WHICH THEY WERE DESTINED NEVER MORE TO POSSESS A THIRD ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE
909-131045-0024 IN THE EXERCISE OF HIS OFFICE THAT EXPERIENCE IS THE PARENT OF WISDOM IS AN ADAGE THE TRUTH OF WHICH IS RECOGNIZED BY THE WISEST AS WELL AS THE SIMPLEST OF MANKIND WHAT MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN THIS QUALITY IN THE GOVERNORS OF NATIONS
909-131045-0025 WHERE MORE DESIRABLE OR MORE ESSENTIAL THAN IN THE FIRST MAGISTRATE OF A NATION CAN IT BE WISE TO PUT THIS DESIRABLE AND ESSENTIAL QUALITY UNDER THE BAN OF THE CONSTITUTION AND TO DECLARE THAT THE MOMENT IT IS ACQUIRED ITS POSSESSOR SHALL BE COMPELLED
909-131045-0026 TO ABANDON THE STATION IN WHICH IT WAS ACQUIRED AND TO WHICH IT IS ADAPTED THIS NEVERTHELESS IS THE PRECISE IMPORT OF ALL THOSE REGULATIONS WHICH EXCLUDE MEN FROM SERVING THEIR COUNTRY
909-131045-0027 BY THE CHOICE OF THEIR FELLOWCITIZENS AFTER THEY HAVE BY A COURSE OF SERVICE FITTED THEMSELVES FOR DOING IT WITH A GREATER DEGREE OF UTILITY A FOURTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THE BANISHING MEN FROM STATIONS IN WHICH
909-131045-0028 IN CERTAIN EMERGENCIES OF THE STATE THEIR PRESENCE MIGHT BE OF THE GREATEST MOMENT TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST OR SAFETY THERE IS NO NATION WHICH HAS NOT AT ONE PERIOD OR ANOTHER EXPERIENCED AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY OF THE SERVICES OF PARTICULAR MEN
909-131045-0029 IN PARTICULAR SITUATIONS PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE TOO STRONG TO SAY TO THE PRESERVATION OF ITS POLITICAL EXISTENCE HOW UNWISE THEREFORE MUST BE EVERY SUCH SELF DENYING ORDINANCE AS SERVES TO PROHIBIT A NATION FROM MAKING USE OF ITS OWN CITIZENS
909-131045-0030 IN THE MANNER BEST SUITED TO ITS EXIGENCIES AND CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT SUPPOSING THE PERSONAL ESSENTIALITY OF THE MAN IT IS EVIDENT THAT A CHANGE OF THE CHIEF MAGISTRATE AT THE BREAKING OUT OF A WAR OR AT ANY SIMILAR CRISIS FOR ANOTHER
909-131045-0031 EVEN OF EQUAL MERIT WOULD AT ALL TIMES BE DETRIMENTAL TO THE COMMUNITY INASMUCH AS IT WOULD SUBSTITUTE INEXPERIENCE TO EXPERIENCE AND WOULD TEND TO UNHINGE AND SET AFLOAT THE ALREADY SETTLED TRAIN OF THE ADMINISTRATION
909-131045-0032 A FIFTH ILL EFFECT OF THE EXCLUSION WOULD BE THAT IT WOULD OPERATE AS A CONSTITUTIONAL INTERDICTION OF STABILITY IN THE ADMINISTRATION BY NECESSITATING A CHANGE OF MEN IN THE FIRST OFFICE OF THE NATION
909-131045-0033 IT WOULD NECESSITATE A MUTABILITY OF MEASURES IT IS NOT GENERALLY TO BE EXPECTED THAT MEN WILL VARY AND MEASURES REMAIN UNIFORM THE CONTRARY IS THE USUAL COURSE OF THINGS
909-131045-0034 AND WE NEED NOT BE APPREHENSIVE THAT THERE WILL BE TOO MUCH STABILITY WHILE THERE IS EVEN THE OPTION OF CHANGING NOR NEED WE DESIRE TO PROHIBIT THE PEOPLE FROM CONTINUING THEIR CONFIDENCE WHERE THEY THINK IT MAY BE SAFELY PLACED AND WHERE BY CONSTANCY ON THEIR PART
909-131045-0035 THEY MAY OBVIATE THE FATAL INCONVENIENCES OF FLUCTUATING COUNCILS AND A VARIABLE POLICY THESE ARE SOME OF THE DISADVANTAGES WHICH WOULD FLOW FROM THE PRINCIPLE OF EXCLUSION THEY APPLY MOST FORCIBLY TO THE SCHEME OF A PERPETUAL EXCLUSION
909-131045-0036 BUT WHEN WE CONSIDER THAT EVEN A PARTIAL EXCLUSION WOULD ALWAYS RENDER THE READMISSION OF THE PERSON A REMOTE AND PRECARIOUS OBJECT THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE WILL APPLY NEARLY AS FULLY TO ONE CASE AS TO THE OTHER
909-131045-0037 WHAT ARE THE ADVANTAGES PROMISED TO COUNTERBALANCE THESE DISADVANTAGES THEY ARE REPRESENTED TO BE FIRST GREATER INDEPENDENCE IN THE MAGISTRATE
909-131045-0038 UNLESS THE EXCLUSION BE PERPETUAL THERE WILL BE NO PRETENSE TO INFER THE FIRST ADVANTAGE BUT EVEN IN THAT CASE MAY HE HAVE NO OBJECT BEYOND HIS PRESENT STATION TO WHICH HE MAY SACRIFICE HIS INDEPENDENCE
909-131045-0039 ON THE ARRIVAL OF WHICH HE NOT ONLY MAY BUT MUST BE EXPOSED TO THEIR RESENTMENTS UPON AN EQUAL PERHAPS UPON AN INFERIOR FOOTING IT IS NOT AN EASY POINT TO DETERMINE WHETHER HIS INDEPENDENCE WOULD BE MOST PROMOTED OR IMPAIRED BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT
909-131045-0040 AS TO THE SECOND SUPPOSED ADVANTAGE THERE IS STILL GREATER REASON TO ENTERTAIN DOUBTS CONCERNING IT IF THE EXCLUSION WERE TO BE PERPETUAL A MAN OF IRREGULAR AMBITION OF WHOM ALONE THERE COULD BE REASON IN ANY CASE TO ENTERTAIN APPREHENSION
909-131045-0041 WOULD WITH INFINITE RELUCTANCE YIELD TO THE NECESSITY OF TAKING HIS LEAVE FOREVER OF A POST IN WHICH HIS PASSION FOR POWER AND PRE EMINENCE HAD ACQUIRED THE FORCE OF HABIT AND IF HE HAD BEEN FORTUNATE OR ADROIT ENOUGH TO CONCILIATE THE GOOD WILL OF THE PEOPLE
909-131045-0042 THERE MAY BE CONCEIVED CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THIS DISGUST OF THE PEOPLE SECONDING THE THWARTED AMBITION OF SUCH A FAVORITE MIGHT OCCASION GREATER DANGER TO LIBERTY THAN COULD EVER REASONABLY BE DREADED FROM THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERPETUATION IN OFFICE
909-131045-0043 BY THE VOLUNTARY SUFFRAGES OF THE COMMUNITY EXERCISING A CONSTITUTIONAL PRIVILEGE THERE IS AN EXCESS OF REFINEMENT IN THE IDEA OF DISABLING THE PEOPLE TO CONTINUE IN OFFICE MEN WHO HAD ENTITLED THEMSELVES IN THEIR OPINION
911-128684-0000 ARE AS DUALISTIC AS IT IS POSSIBLE TO BE THOUGHTS WE ALL NATURALLY THINK ARE MADE OF ONE KIND OF SUBSTANCE AND THINGS OF ANOTHER CONSCIOUSNESS FLOWING INSIDE OF US IN THE FORMS OF CONCEPTION OR JUDGMENT
911-128684-0001 OR CONCENTRATING ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF PASSION OR EMOTION CAN BE DIRECTLY FELT AS THE SPIRITUAL ACTIVITY WHICH IT IS AND KNOWN IN CONTRAST WITH THE SPACE FILLING OBJECTIVE CONTENT WHICH IT ENVELOPES AND ACCOMPANIES
911-128684-0002 IN OPPOSITION TO THIS DUALISTIC PHILOSOPHY I TRIED IN THE FIRST ESSAY TO SHOW THAT THOUGHTS AND THINGS ARE ABSOLUTELY HOMOGENEOUS AS TO THEIR MATERIAL AND THAT THEIR OPPOSITION IS ONLY ONE OF RELATION AND OF FUNCTION
911-128684-0003 THERE IS NO THOUGHT STUFF DIFFERENT FROM THING STUFF I SAID BUT THE SAME IDENTICAL PIECE OF PURE EXPERIENCE WHICH WAS THE NAME I GAVE TO THE MATERIA PRIMA OF EVERYTHING
911-128684-0004 CAN STAND ALTERNATELY FOR A FACT OF CONSCIOUSNESS OR FOR A PHYSICAL REALITY ACCORDING AS IT IS TAKEN IN ONE CONTEXT OR IN ANOTHER FOR THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FOLLOWS
911-128684-0005 IN OUR PLEASURES AND PAINS OUR LOVES AND FEARS AND ANGERS IN THE BEAUTY COMICALITY IMPORTANCE OR PRECIOUSNESS OF CERTAIN OBJECTS AND SITUATIONS WE HAVE I AM TOLD BY MANY CRITICS
911-128684-0006 A GREAT REALM OF EXPERIENCE INTUITIVELY RECOGNIZED AS SPIRITUAL MADE AND FELT TO BE MADE OF CONSCIOUSNESS EXCLUSIVELY AND DIFFERENT IN NATURE FROM THE SPACE FILLING KIND OF BEING WHICH IS ENJOYED BY PHYSICAL OBJECTS
911-128684-0007 BECAUSE I HAD TO BE SO BRIEF I NOW RETURN TO THE SUBJECT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT SO FAR FROM INVALIDATING MY GENERAL THESIS THESE PHENOMENA WHEN PROPERLY ANALYZED AFFORD IT POWERFUL SUPPORT
911-128684-0008 THE CENTRAL POINT OF THE PURE EXPERIENCE THEORY IS THAT OUTER AND INNER ARE NAMES FOR TWO GROUPS INTO WHICH WE SORT EXPERIENCES ACCORDING TO THE WAY IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON THEIR NEIGHBORS
911-128684-0009 ANY ONE CONTENT SUCH AS HARD LET US SAY CAN BE ASSIGNED TO EITHER GROUP IN THE OUTER GROUP IT IS STRONG IT ACTS ENERGETICALLY AND AGGRESSIVELY
911-128684-0010 HERE WHATEVER IS HARD INTERFERES WITH THE SPACE ITS NEIGHBORS OCCUPY IT DENTS THEM IS IMPENETRABLE BY THEM AND WE CALL THE HARDNESS THEN A PHYSICAL HARDNESS
911-128684-0011 IN THE MIND ON THE CONTRARY THE HARD THING IS NOWHERE IN PARTICULAR IT DENTS NOTHING IT SUFFUSES THROUGH ITS MENTAL NEIGHBORS AS IT WERE AND INTERPENETRATES THEM
911-128684-0012 TAKEN IN THIS GROUP WE CALL BOTH IT AND THEM IDEAS OR SENSATIONS AND THE BASIS OF THE TWO GROUPS RESPECTIVELY IS THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF INTERRELATION
911-128684-0013 THE MUTUAL IMPENETRABILITY ON THE ONE HAND AND THE LACK OF PHYSICAL INTERFERENCE AND INTERACTION ON THE OTHER THAT WHAT IN ITSELF IS ONE AND THE SAME ENTITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO FUNCTION THUS DIFFERENTLY IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS
911-128684-0014 IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE EXTREMELY COMPLEX RETICULATIONS IN WHICH OUR EXPERIENCES COME TO HER OFFSPRING A TIGRESS IS TENDER BUT CRUEL TO EVERY OTHER LIVING THING
911-128684-0015 BOTH CRUEL AND TENDER THEREFORE AT ONCE A MASS IN MOVEMENT RESISTS EVERY FORCE THAT OPERATES CONTRARIWISE TO ITS OWN DIRECTION BUT TO FORCES THAT PURSUE THE SAME DIRECTION OR COME IN AT RIGHT ANGLES
911-128684-0016 IT IS ABSOLUTELY INERT IT IS THUS BOTH ENERGETIC AND INERT AND THE SAME IS TRUE IF YOU VARY THE ASSOCIATES PROPERLY OF EVERY OTHER PIECE OF EXPERIENCE
911-128684-0017 IT IS ONLY TOWARDS CERTAIN SPECIFIC GROUPS OF ASSOCIATES THAT THE PHYSICAL ENERGIES AS WE CALL THEM OF A CONTENT ARE PUT FORTH IN ANOTHER GROUP IT MAY BE QUITE INERT
911-128684-0018 IT IS POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A UNIVERSE OF EXPERIENCES IN WHICH THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN NEIGHBORS WOULD BE EITHER PHYSICAL INTERACTION OR COMPLETE INERTNESS
911-128684-0019 IN SUCH A WORLD THE MENTAL OR THE PHYSICAL STATUS OF ANY PIECE OF EXPERIENCE WOULD BE UNEQUIVOCAL WHEN ACTIVE IT WOULD FIGURE IN THE PHYSICAL AND WHEN INACTIVE IN THE MENTAL GROUP
911-128684-0020 BUT THE UNIVERSE WE LIVE IN IS MORE CHAOTIC THAN THIS AND THERE IS ROOM IN IT FOR THE HYBRID OR AMBIGUOUS GROUP OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES OF OUR EMOTIONS AND APPRECIATIVE PERCEPTIONS
911-128684-0021 IN THE PARAGRAPHS THAT FOLLOW I SHALL TRY TO SHOW ONE THAT THE POPULAR NOTION THAT THESE EXPERIENCES ARE INTUITIVELY GIVEN AS PURELY INNER FACTS IS HASTY AND ERRONEOUS AND TWO
911-128684-0022 THAT THEIR AMBIGUITY ILLUSTRATES BEAUTIFULLY MY CENTRAL THESIS THAT SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY ARE AFFAIRS NOT OF WHAT AN EXPERIENCE IS ABORIGINALLY MADE OF BUT OF ITS CLASSIFICATION
911-128684-0023 CLASSIFICATIONS DEPEND ON OUR TEMPORARY PURPOSES FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES IT IS CONVENIENT TO TAKE THINGS IN ONE SET OF RELATIONS
911-128684-0024 IN THE TWO CASES THEIR CONTEXTS ARE APT TO BE DIFFERENT IN THE CASE OF OUR AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WE HAVE NO PERMANENT AND STEADFAST PURPOSE THAT OBLIGES US TO BE CONSISTENT
911-128684-0025 SO WE FIND IT EASY TO LET THEM FLOAT AMBIGUOUSLY SOMETIMES CLASSING THEM WITH OUR FEELINGS SOMETIMES WITH MORE PHYSICAL REALITIES ACCORDING TO CAPRICE OR TO THE CONVENIENCE OF THE MOMENT
911-128684-0026 THUS WOULD THESE EXPERIENCES SO FAR FROM BEING AN OBSTACLE TO THE PURE EXPERIENCE PHILOSOPHY SERVE AS AN EXCELLENT CORROBORATION OF ITS TRUTH FIRST OF ALL THEN IT IS A MISTAKE TO SAY
911-128684-0027 WITH THE OBJECTORS WHOM I BEGAN BY CITING THAT ANGER LOVE AND FEAR ARE AFFECTIONS PURELY OF THE MIND
911-128684-0028 THEY ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AFFECTIONS OF THE BODY
911-128684-0029 AND WE ARE ALWAYS FREE TO SPEAK OF THEM IN OBJECTIVE AS WELL AS IN SUBJECTIVE TERMS WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE AWARE OF A PAINFUL PLACE FILLING A CERTAIN BIGNESS IN OUR ORGANISM
911-128684-0030 OR WE CAN SAY THAT WE ARE INWARDLY IN A STATE OF PAIN ALL OUR ADJECTIVES OF WORTH ARE SIMILARLY AMBIGUOUS
911-128684-0031 OR IS IT A FEELING IN OUR MIND PRACTICALLY WE TREAT IT AS BOTH OR AS EITHER ACCORDING TO THE TEMPORARY DIRECTION OF OUR THOUGHT BEAUTY SAYS PROFESSOR SANTAYANA IS PLEASURE OBJECTIFIED
911-128684-0032 AND IN SECTIONS TEN AND ELEVEN OF HIS WORK THE SENSE OF BEAUTY HE TREATS IN A MASTERLY WAY OF THIS EQUIVOCAL REALM THE VARIOUS PLEASURES WE RECEIVE FROM AN OBJECT
911-128684-0033 MAY COUNT AS FEELINGS WHEN WE TAKE THEM SINGLY BUT WHEN THEY COMBINE IN A TOTAL RICHNESS WE CALL THE RESULT THE BEAUTY OF THE OBJECT AND TREAT IT AS AN OUTER ATTRIBUTE WHICH OUR MIND PERCEIVES
911-128684-0034 WE DISCOVER BEAUTY JUST AS WE DISCOVER THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THINGS TRAINING IS NEEDED TO MAKE US EXPERT IN EITHER LINE SINGLE SENSATIONS ALSO MAY BE AMBIGUOUS SHALL WE SAY
911-128684-0035 AN AGREEABLE DEGREE OF HEAT OR AN AGREEABLE FEELING OCCASIONED BY THE DEGREE OF HEAT EITHER WILL DO AND LANGUAGE WOULD LOSE MOST OF ITS ESTHETIC AND RHETORICAL VALUE
911-128684-0036 WERE WE FORBIDDEN TO PROJECT WORDS PRIMARILY CONNOTING OUR AFFECTIONS UPON THE OBJECTS BY WHICH THE AFFECTIONS ARE AROUSED THE MAN IS REALLY HATEFUL THE ACTION REALLY MEAN THE SITUATION REALLY TRAGIC
911-128684-0037 ALL IN THEMSELVES AND QUITE APART FROM OUR OPINION WE EVEN GO SO FAR AS TO TALK OF A WEARY ROAD A GIDDY HEIGHT A JOCUND MORNING OR A SULLEN SKY
911-128684-0038 AND THE TERM INDEFINITE WHILE USUALLY APPLIED ONLY TO OUR APPREHENSIONS FUNCTIONS AS A FUNDAMENTAL PHYSICAL QUALIFICATION OF THINGS IN SPENCER'S LAW OF EVOLUTION
911-128684-0039 AND DOUBTLESS PASSES WITH MOST READERS FOR ALL RIGHT PSYCHOLOGISTS STUDYING OUR PERCEPTIONS OF MOVEMENT HAVE UNEARTHED EXPERIENCES IN WHICH MOVEMENT IS FELT IN GENERAL
911-128684-0040 BUT NOT ASCRIBED CORRECTLY TO THE BODY THAT REALLY MOVES THUS IN OPTICAL VERTIGO CAUSED BY UNCONSCIOUS MOVEMENTS OF OUR EYES BOTH WE AND THE EXTERNAL UNIVERSE APPEAR TO BE IN A WHIRL
911-128684-0041 WHEN CLOUDS FLOAT BY THE MOON IT IS AS IF BOTH CLOUDS AND MOON AND WE OURSELVES SHARED IN THE MOTION IN THE EXTRAORDINARY CASE OF AMNESIA
911-128684-0042 PUBLISHED BY SIDIS AND GOODHART IN THEIR IMPORTANT WORK ON MULTIPLE PERSONALITY WE READ THAT WHEN THE PATIENT FIRST RECOVERED CONSCIOUSNESS AND
911-128684-0043 NOTICED AN ATTENDANT WALK ACROSS THE ROOM HE IDENTIFIED THE MOVEMENT WITH THAT OF HIS OWN HE DID NOT YET DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN HIS OWN MOVEMENTS AND THOSE OUTSIDE HIMSELF
911-128684-0044 IN WHICH DISCRIMINATIONS AFTERWARDS NEEDFUL HAVE NOT YET BEEN MADE A PIECE OF EXPERIENCE OF A DETERMINATE SORT IS THERE BUT THERE AT FIRST AS A PURE FACT
911-128684-0045 MOTION ORIGINALLY SIMPLY IS ONLY LATER IS IT CONFINED TO THIS THING OR TO THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS IS TRUE OF EVERY EXPERIENCE HOWEVER COMPLEX
911-128684-0046 AT THE MOMENT OF ITS ACTUAL PRESENCE LET THE READER ARREST HIMSELF IN THE ACT OF READING THIS ARTICLE NOW
911-128684-0047 IS THERE AND WHETHER THERE FOR SOME ONE'S CONSCIOUSNESS OR THERE FOR PHYSICAL NATURE IS A QUESTION NOT YET PUT AT THE MOMENT IT IS THERE FOR NEITHER LATER
911-128684-0048 WE SHALL PROBABLY JUDGE IT TO HAVE BEEN THERE FOR BOTH WITH THE AFFECTIONAL EXPERIENCES WHICH WE ARE CONSIDERING THE RELATIVELY PURE CONDITION LASTS IN PRACTICAL LIFE NO URGENT NEED HAS YET ARISEN FOR DECIDING WHETHER TO TREAT THEM AS RIGOROUSLY MENTAL
911-128684-0049 OR AS RIGOROUSLY PHYSICAL FACTS SO THEY REMAIN EQUIVOCAL AND AS THE WORLD GOES THEIR EQUIVOCALITY IS ONE OF THEIR GREAT CONVENIENCES
911-128684-0050 ARE NOT COEFFICIENTS WITH WHICH EXPERIENCES COME TO US ABORIGINALLY STAMPED BUT ARE RATHER RESULTS OF A LATER CLASSIFICATION PERFORMED BY US FOR PARTICULAR NEEDS
911-128684-0051 THE COMMON SENSE STAGE OF THOUGHT IS A PERFECTLY DEFINITE PRACTICAL HALTING PLACE THE PLACE WHERE WE OURSELVES CAN PROCEED TO ACT UNHESITATINGLY ON THIS STAGE OF THOUGHT
911-128684-0052 THINGS ACT ON EACH OTHER AS WELL AS ON US BY MEANS OF THEIR SECONDARY QUALITIES SOUND AS SUCH GOES THROUGH THE AIR AND CAN BE INTERCEPTED
911-128684-0053 INTO THE WATER WHICH IT SETS A BOILING IT IS THE VERY LIGHT OF THE ARC LAMP WHICH DISPLACES THE DARKNESS OF THE MIDNIGHT STREET ET CETERA BY ENGENDERING AND TRANSLOCATING JUST THESE QUALITIES
911-128684-0054 ACTIVELY EFFICACIOUS AS THEY SEEM TO BE WE OURSELVES SUCCEED IN ALTERING NATURE SO AS TO SUIT US AND UNTIL MORE PURELY INTELLECTUAL AS DISTINGUISHED FROM PRACTICAL NEEDS HAD ARISEN
911-128684-0055 NO ONE EVER THOUGHT OF CALLING THESE QUALITIES SUBJECTIVE WHEN HOWEVER GALILEO DESCARTES AND OTHERS FOUND IT BEST FOR PHILOSOPHIC PURPOSES TO CLASS SOUND HEAT AND LIGHT ALONG WITH PAIN AND PLEASURE AS PURELY MENTAL PHENOMENA
911-128684-0056 HARDNESS AND SOFTNESS ARE EFFECTS ON US OF ATOMIC INTERACTIONS AND THE ATOMS THEMSELVES ARE NEITHER HARD NOR SOFT NOR SOLID NOR LIQUID SIZE AND SHAPE ARE DEEMED SUBJECTIVE BY KANTIANS
911-128684-0057 ARE NOW TREATED AS ILLUSORY PROJECTIONS OUTWARDS OF PHENOMENA OF OUR OWN CONSCIOUSNESS THERE ARE NO ACTIVITIES OR EFFECTS IN NATURE FOR THE MOST INTELLECTUAL CONTEMPORARY SCHOOL OF PHYSICAL SPECULATION
911-128684-0058 NATURE EXHIBITS ONLY CHANGES WHICH HABITUALLY COINCIDE WITH ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0059 BUT ONLY A TRANSLOCATION OF EXPERIENCES FROM ONE WORLD TO ANOTHER A GROUPING OF THEM WITH ONE SET OR ANOTHER OF ASSOCIATES FOR DEFINITELY PRACTICAL OR INTELLECTUAL ENDS
911-128684-0060 I WILL SAY NOTHING HERE OF THE PERSISTENT AMBIGUITY OF RELATIONS THEY ARE UNDENIABLE PARTS OF PURE EXPERIENCE YET WHILE COMMON SENSE AND WHAT I CALL RADICAL EMPIRICISM STAND FOR THEIR BEING OBJECTIVE
911-128684-0061 BOTH RATIONALISM AND THE USUAL EMPIRICISM CLAIM THAT THEY ARE EXCLUSIVELY THE WORK OF THE MIND' THE FINITE MIND OR THE ABSOLUTE MIND AS THE CASE MAY BE
911-128684-0062 TURN NOW TO THOSE AFFECTIVE PHENOMENA WHICH MORE DIRECTLY CONCERN US WE SOON LEARN TO SEPARATE THE WAYS IN WHICH THINGS APPEAL TO OUR INTERESTS AND EMOTIONS FROM THE WAYS IN WHICH THEY ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER
911-128684-0063 IT DOES NOT WORK TO ASSUME THAT PHYSICAL OBJECTS ARE GOING TO ACT OUTWARDLY BY THEIR SYMPATHETIC OR ANTIPATHETIC QUALITIES THE BEAUTY OF A THING OR ITS VALUE IS NO FORCE THAT CAN BE PLOTTED IN A POLYGON OF COMPOSITIONS
911-128684-0064 NOR DOES ITS USE OR SIGNIFICANCE
911-128684-0065 ITS VICISSITUDES OR DESTINY AT THE HANDS OF PHYSICAL NATURE CHEMICAL AFFINITIES ARE A PURELY VERBAL METAPHOR AND AS I JUST SAID
911-128684-0066 EVEN SUCH THINGS AS FORCES TENSIONS AND ACTIVITIES CAN AT A PINCH BE REGARDED AS ANTHROPOMORPHIC PROJECTIONS SO FAR THEN AS THE PHYSICAL WORLD MEANS THE COLLECTION OF CONTENTS THAT DETERMINE IN EACH OTHER CERTAIN REGULAR CHANGES
911-128684-0067 THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF OUR APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES HAS TO BE TREATED AS FALLING OUTSIDE OF IT IF WE MEAN BY PHYSICAL NATURE WHATEVER LIES BEYOND THE SURFACE OF OUR BODIES
911-128684-0068 WHY THEN DO MEN LEAVE THEM AS AMBIGUOUS AS THEY DO AND NOT CLASS THEM DECISIVELY AS PURELY SPIRITUAL THE REASON WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT ALTHOUGH THEY ARE INERT AS REGARDS THE REST OF PHYSICAL NATURE
911-128684-0069 THEY ARE NOT INERT AS REGARDS THAT PART OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR OWN SKIN COVERS IT IS THOSE VERY APPRECIATIVE ATTRIBUTES OF THINGS THEIR DANGEROUSNESS BEAUTY RARITY UTILITY ET CETERA
911-128684-0070 THAT PRIMARILY APPEAL TO OUR ATTENTION IN OUR COMMERCE WITH NATURE THESE ATTRIBUTES ARE WHAT GIVE EMPHASIS TO OBJECTS AND FOR AN OBJECT TO BE EMPHATIC WHATEVER SPIRITUAL FACT IT MAY MEAN
911-128684-0071 MEANS ALSO THAT IT PRODUCES IMMEDIATE BODILY EFFECTS UPON US ALTERATIONS OF TONE AND TENSION OF HEART BEAT AND BREATHING OF VASCULAR AND VISCERAL ACTION
911-128684-0072 THE INTERESTING ASPECTS OF THINGS ARE THUS NOT WHOLLY INERT PHYSICALLY THOUGH THEY BE ACTIVE ONLY IN THESE SMALL CORNERS OF PHYSICAL NATURE WHICH OUR BODIES OCCUPY
911-128684-0073 THAT HOWEVER IS ENOUGH TO SAVE THEM FROM BEING CLASSED AS ABSOLUTELY NON OBJECTIVE THE ATTEMPT IF ANY ONE SHOULD MAKE IT TO SORT EXPERIENCES INTO TWO ABSOLUTELY DISCRETE GROUPS
911-128684-0074 WITH NOTHING BUT INERTNESS IN ONE OF THEM AND NOTHING BUT ACTIVITIES IN THE OTHER WOULD THUS RECEIVE ONE CHECK IT WOULD RECEIVE ANOTHER AS SOON AS WE EXAMINED THE MORE DISTINCTIVELY MENTAL GROUP
911-128684-0075 FOR THOUGH IN THAT GROUP IT BE TRUE THAT THINGS DO NOT ACT ON ONE ANOTHER BY THEIR PHYSICAL PROPERTIES DO NOT DENT EACH OTHER OR SET FIRE TO EACH OTHER
911-128684-0076 THEY YET ACT ON EACH OTHER IN THE MOST ENERGETIC WAY BY THOSE VERY CHARACTERS WHICH ARE SO INERT EXTRACORPOREALLY IT IS BY THE INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE THAT EXPERIENCES HAVE FOR US BY THE EMOTIONS THEY EXCITE
911-128684-0077 AND THE PURPOSES THEY SUBSERVE BY THEIR AFFECTIVE VALUES IN SHORT THAT THEIR CONSECUTION IN OUR SEVERAL CONSCIOUS STREAMS AS THOUGHTS OF OURS IS MAINLY RULED DESIRE INTRODUCES THEM INTEREST HOLDS THEM
911-128684-0078 FITNESS FIXES THEIR ORDER AND CONNECTION I NEED ONLY REFER FOR THIS ASPECT OF OUR MENTAL LIFE
911-128684-0079 IS THE MOST NATURAL THING IN THE WORLD IT WOULD HOWEVER BE AN UNNATURAL STATUS IF THE POPULAR OPINION WHICH I CITED AT THE OUTSET WERE CORRECT IF PHYSICAL AND MENTAL MEANT TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF INTRINSIC NATURE
911-128684-0080 IMMEDIATELY INTUITIVELY AND INFALLIBLY DISCERNIBLE AND EACH FIXED FOREVER IN WHATEVER BIT OF EXPERIENCE IT QUALIFIED ONE DOES NOT SEE HOW THERE COULD EVER HAVE ARISEN ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT OR AMBIGUITY
911-128684-0081 BUT IF ON THE CONTRARY THESE WORDS ARE WORDS OF SORTING AMBIGUITY IS NATURAL FOR THEN AS SOON AS THE RELATIONS OF A THING ARE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS IT CAN BE SORTED VARIOUSLY
911-128684-0082 TAKE A MASS OF CARRION FOR EXAMPLE
911-128684-0083 THE SUN CARESSES IT AND THE ZEPHYR WOOES IT AS IF IT WERE A BED OF ROSES SO THE DISGUSTINGNESS FAILS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE REALM OF SUNS AND BREEZES
911-128684-0084 IT DOES NOT FUNCTION AS A PHYSICAL QUALITY BUT THE CARRION TURNS OUR STOMACH BY WHAT SEEMS A DIRECT OPERATION IT DOES FUNCTION PHYSICALLY THEREFORE IN THAT LIMITED PART OF PHYSICS
911-128684-0085 AND CONVERSELY OF COURSE WE MUST TREAT IT AS NON MENTAL OR AS MENTAL OUR BODY ITSELF IS THE PALMARY INSTANCE OF THE AMBIGUOUS SOMETIMES I TREAT MY BODY PURELY AS A PART OF OUTER NATURE
911-128684-0086 SOMETIMES AGAIN I THINK OF IT AS MINE I SORT IT WITH THE ME AND THEN CERTAIN LOCAL CHANGES AND DETERMINATIONS IN IT PASS FOR SPIRITUAL HAPPENINGS ITS BREATHING IS MY THINKING
911-128684-0087 ITS SENSORIAL ADJUSTMENTS ARE MY ATTENTION
911-128684-0088 ITS VISCERAL PERTURBATIONS ARE MY EMOTIONS THE OBSTINATE CONTROVERSIES THAT HAVE ARISEN OVER SUCH STATEMENTS AS THESE WHICH SOUND SO PARADOXICAL AND WHICH CAN YET BE MADE SO SERIOUSLY
911-128684-0089 PROVE HOW HARD IT IS TO DECIDE BY BARE INTROSPECTION WHAT IT IS IN EXPERIENCES THAT SHALL MAKE THEM EITHER SPIRITUAL OR MATERIAL IT SURELY CAN BE NOTHING INTRINSIC IN THE INDIVIDUAL EXPERIENCE
911-128684-0090 IT IS THEIR WAY OF BEHAVING TOWARDS EACH OTHER THEIR SYSTEM OF RELATIONS THEIR FUNCTION AND ALL THESE THINGS VARY WITH THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WE FIND IT OPPORTUNE TO CONSIDER THEM I THINK I MAY CONCLUDE THEN
911-128684-0091 AND I HOPE THAT MY READERS ARE NOW READY TO CONCLUDE WITH ME THAT THE PRETENDED SPIRITUALITY OF OUR EMOTIONS AND OF OUR ATTRIBUTES OF VALUE SO FAR FROM PROVING AN OBJECTION TO THE PHILOSOPHY OF PURE EXPERIENCE DOES WHEN RIGHTLY DISCUSSED AND ACCOUNTED FOR
911-130578-0000 AND FOR THIS THE VILLAGE BOYS WITH WHOM HE PLAYED USED TO QUARREL WITH HIM SAYING FATHERLESS ORPHAN WHY DO YOU CHEAT SO ONE DAY HE ASKED HIS MOTHER WHY THEY CALLED HIM THAT NAME AND WHETHER HIS FATHER WAS REALLY DEAD
911-130578-0001 HE IS ALIVE SAID SHE BUT A LONG TIME AGO A RHINOCEROS CARRIED HIM OFF ON ITS HORN THEN THE BOY VOWED THAT HE WOULD GO IN SEARCH OF HIS FATHER AND MADE HIS MOTHER PUT HIM UP PROVISIONS FOR THE JOURNEY
911-130578-0002 AND HE STARTED OFF TAKING WITH HIM AN IRON BOW AND A BIG BUNDLE OF ARROWS HE JOURNEYED ON ALL DAY AND AT NIGHTFALL HE CAME TO A VILLAGE THERE HE WENT UP TO THE HOUSE OF AN OLD WOMAN TO ASK FOR A BED
911-130578-0003 GRANNIE GRANNIE OPEN THE DOOR I HAVE NO SON AND NO GRANDCHILDREN TO CALL ME GRANNIE GRUMBLED THE OLD WOMAN AND WENT TO OPEN THE DOOR TO SEE WHO WAS THERE AND WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND SAW HIM SHE SAID HO
911-130578-0004 YOU ARE MY GRANDSON YES ANSWERED HE I AM YOUR GRANDCHILD SO SHE CALLED HIM INSIDE AND GAVE HIM A BED TO SLEEP ON THE OLD WOMAN WAS CALLED HUTIBUDI
911-130578-0005 AND SHE AND THE BOY SAT UP LATE TALKING TOGETHER AND THEN THEY LAY DOWN TO SLEEP BUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT HE HEARD THE OLD WOMAN CRUNCHING AWAY TRYING TO BITE HIS BOW TO PIECES
911-130578-0006 HE ASKED HER WHAT SHE WAS EATING SOME PULSE I GOT FROM THE VILLAGE HEADMAN GIVE ME A LITTLE TO TRY HE BEGGED I AM SORRY MY CHILD I HAVE FINISHED IT ALL
911-130578-0007 BUT REALLY SHE HAD NONE TO GIVE HOWEVER SHE ONLY HURT HER JAWS BITING SO THAT SHE BEGAN TO GROAN WITH PAIN WHAT ARE YOU GROANING FOR GRANNIE SAID THE BOY
911-130578-0008 AND IN TRUTH HER CHEEKS WERE BADLY SWOLLEN THEN HE TOLD HER THAT A GOOD CURE FOR TOOTHACHE WAS TO BITE ON A WHITE STONE AND SHE BELIEVED HIM AND THE NEXT MORNING GOT A PIECE OF WHITE QUARTZ AND BEGAN TO BITE ON IT

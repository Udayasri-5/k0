103-1240-0000 CHAPTER ONE MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE IS SURPRISED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE LIVED JUST WHERE THE AVONLEA MAIN ROAD DIPPED DOWN INTO A LITTLE HOLLOW FRINGED WITH ALDERS AND LADIES EARDROPS AND TRAVERSED BY A BROOK
103-1240-0001 THAT HAD ITS SOURCE AWAY BACK IN THE WOODS OF THE OLD CUTHBERT PLACE IT WAS REPUTED TO BE AN INTRICATE HEADLONG BROOK IN ITS EARLIER COURSE THROUGH THOSE WOODS WITH DARK SECRETS OF POOL AND CASCADE BUT BY THE TIME IT REACHED LYNDE'S HOLLOW IT WAS A QUIET WELL CONDUCTED LITTLE STREAM
103-1240-0002 FOR NOT EVEN A BROOK COULD RUN PAST MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE'S DOOR WITHOUT DUE REGARD FOR DECENCY AND DECORUM IT PROBABLY WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MISSUS RACHEL WAS SITTING AT HER WINDOW KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON EVERYTHING THAT PASSED FROM BROOKS AND CHILDREN UP
103-1240-0003 AND THAT IF SHE NOTICED ANYTHING ODD OR OUT OF PLACE SHE WOULD NEVER REST UNTIL SHE HAD FERRETED OUT THE WHYS AND WHEREFORES THEREOF THERE ARE PLENTY OF PEOPLE IN AVONLEA AND OUT OF IT WHO CAN ATTEND CLOSELY TO THEIR NEIGHBOR'S BUSINESS BY DINT OF NEGLECTING THEIR OWN
103-1240-0004 BUT MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE WAS ONE OF THOSE CAPABLE CREATURES WHO CAN MANAGE THEIR OWN CONCERNS AND THOSE OF OTHER FOLKS INTO THE BARGAIN SHE WAS A NOTABLE HOUSEWIFE HER WORK WAS ALWAYS DONE AND WELL DONE SHE RAN THE SEWING CIRCLE
103-1240-0005 HELPED RUN THE SUNDAY SCHOOL AND WAS THE STRONGEST PROP OF THE CHURCH AID SOCIETY AND FOREIGN MISSIONS AUXILIARY YET WITH ALL THIS MISSUS RACHEL FOUND ABUNDANT TIME TO SIT FOR HOURS AT HER KITCHEN WINDOW KNITTING COTTON WARP QUILTS SHE HAD KNITTED SIXTEEN OF THEM
103-1240-0006 AS AVONLEA HOUSEKEEPERS WERE WONT TO TELL IN AWED VOICES AND KEEPING A SHARP EYE ON THE MAIN ROAD THAT CROSSED THE HOLLOW AND WOUND UP THE STEEP RED HILL BEYOND
103-1240-0007 ANYBODY WHO WENT OUT OF IT OR INTO IT HAD TO PASS OVER THAT HILL ROAD AND SO RUN THE UNSEEN GAUNTLET OF MISSUS RACHEL'S ALL SEEING EYE SHE WAS SITTING THERE ONE AFTERNOON IN EARLY JUNE THE SUN WAS COMING IN AT THE WINDOW WARM AND BRIGHT
103-1240-0008 THE ORCHARD ON THE SLOPE BELOW THE HOUSE WAS IN A BRIDAL FLUSH OF PINKY WHITE BLOOM HUMMED OVER BY A MYRIAD OF BEES THOMAS LYNDE A MEEK LITTLE MAN WHOM AVONLEA PEOPLE CALLED RACHEL LYNDE'S HUSBAND WAS SOWING HIS LATE TURNIP SEED ON THE HILL FIELD BEYOND THE BARN
103-1240-0009 MISSUS RACHEL KNEW THAT HE OUGHT BECAUSE SHE HAD HEARD HIM TELL PETER MORRISON THE EVENING BEFORE IN WILLIAM J BLAIR'S STORE OVER AT CARMODY THAT HE MEANT TO SOW HIS TURNIP SEED THE NEXT AFTERNOON
103-1240-0010 PETER HAD ASKED HIM OF COURSE FOR MATTHEW CUTHBERT HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO VOLUNTEER INFORMATION ABOUT ANYTHING IN HIS WHOLE LIFE AND YET HERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT AT HALF PAST THREE ON THE AFTERNOON OF A BUSY DAY PLACIDLY DRIVING OVER THE HOLLOW AND UP THE HILL
103-1240-0011 AND HIS BEST SUIT OF CLOTHES WHICH WAS PLAIN PROOF THAT HE WAS GOING OUT OF AVONLEA AND HE HAD THE BUGGY AND THE SORREL MARE WHICH BETOKENED THAT HE WAS GOING A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE NOW WHERE WAS MATTHEW CUTHBERT GOING AND WHY WAS HE GOING THERE
103-1240-0012 HAD IT BEEN ANY OTHER MAN IN AVONLEA MISSUS RACHEL DEFTLY PUTTING THIS AND THAT TOGETHER MIGHT HAVE GIVEN A PRETTY GOOD GUESS AS TO BOTH QUESTIONS BUT MATTHEW SO RARELY WENT FROM HOME THAT IT MUST BE SOMETHING PRESSING AND UNUSUAL WHICH WAS TAKING HIM
103-1240-0013 HE WAS THE SHYEST MAN ALIVE AND HATED TO HAVE TO GO AMONG STRANGERS OR TO ANY PLACE WHERE HE MIGHT HAVE TO TALK MATTHEW DRESSED UP WITH A WHITE COLLAR AND DRIVING IN A BUGGY WAS SOMETHING THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OFTEN MISSUS RACHEL PONDER AS SHE MIGHT COULD MAKE NOTHING OF IT
103-1240-0014 AND HER AFTERNOON'S ENJOYMENT WAS SPOILED I'LL JUST STEP OVER TO GREEN GABLES AFTER TEA AND FIND OUT FROM MARILLA WHERE HE'S GONE AND WHY THE WORTHY WOMAN FINALLY CONCLUDED HE DOESN'T GENERALLY GO TO TOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR AND HE NEVER VISITS
103-1240-0015 IF HE'D RUN OUT OF TURNIP SEED HE WOULDN'T DRESS UP AND TAKE THE BUGGY TO GO FOR MORE
103-1240-0016 YET SOMETHING MUST HAVE HAPPENED SINCE LAST NIGHT TO START HIM OFF I'M CLEAN PUZZLED THAT'S WHAT AND I WON'T KNOW A MINUTE'S PEACE OF MIND OR CONSCIENCE UNTIL I KNOW WHAT HAS TAKEN MATTHEW CUTHBERT OUT OF AVONLEA TODAY ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA MISSUS RACHEL SET OUT SHE HAD NOT FAR TO GO
103-1240-0017 THE BIG RAMBLING ORCHARD EMBOWERED HOUSE WHERE THE CUTHBERTS LIVED WAS A SCANT QUARTER OF A MILE UP THE ROAD FROM LYNDE'S HOLLOW TO BE SURE THE LONG LANE MADE IT A GOOD DEAL FURTHER MATTHEW CUTHBERT'S FATHER AS SHY AND SILENT AS HIS SON AFTER HIM
103-1240-0018 HAD GOT AS FAR AWAY AS HE POSSIBLY COULD FROM HIS FELLOW MEN WITHOUT ACTUALLY RETREATING INTO THE WOODS WHEN HE FOUNDED HIS HOMESTEAD GREEN GABLES WAS BUILT AT THE FURTHEST EDGE OF HIS CLEARED LAND AND THERE IT WAS TO THIS DAY
103-1240-0019 BARELY VISIBLE FROM THE MAIN ROAD ALONG WHICH ALL THE OTHER AVONLEA HOUSES WERE SO SOCIABLY SITUATED MISSUS RACHEL LYNDE DID NOT CALL LIVING IN SUCH A PLACE LIVING AT ALL IT'S JUST STAYING THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID AS SHE STEPPED ALONG THE DEEP RUTTED GRASSY LANE
103-1240-0020 BORDERED WITH WILD ROSE BUSHES IT'S NO WONDER MATTHEW AND MARILLA ARE BOTH A LITTLE ODD LIVING AWAY BACK HERE BY THEMSELVES TREES AREN'T MUCH COMPANY THOUGH DEAR KNOWS IF THEY WERE THERE'D BE ENOUGH OF THEM I'D RUTHER LOOK AT PEOPLE TO BE SURE
103-1240-0021 THEY SEEM CONTENTED ENOUGH BUT THEN I SUPPOSE THEY'RE USED TO IT A BODY CAN GET USED TO ANYTHING EVEN TO BEING HANGED AS THE IRISHMAN SAID WITH THIS MISSUS RACHEL STEPPED OUT OF THE LANE INTO THE BACKYARD OF GREEN GABLES VERY GREEN AND NEAT AND PRECISE WAS THAT YARD
103-1240-0022 SET ABOUT ON ONE SIDE WITH GREAT PATRIARCHAL WILLOWS AND THE OTHER WITH PRIM LOMBARDIES NOT A STRAY STICK NOR STONE WAS TO BE SEEN FOR MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE SEEN IT IF THERE HAD BEEN PRIVATELY SHE WAS OF THE OPINION THAT MARILLA CUTHBERT SWEPT THAT YARD OVER AS OFTEN AS SHE SWEPT HER HOUSE
103-1240-0023 ONE COULD HAVE EATEN A MEAL OFF THE GROUND WITHOUT OVERBRIMMING THE PROVERBIAL PECK OF DIRT MISSUS RACHEL RAPPED SMARTLY AT THE KITCHEN DOOR AND STEPPED IN WHEN BIDDEN TO DO SO THE KITCHEN AT GREEN GABLES WAS A CHEERFUL APARTMENT
103-1240-0024 OR WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEERFUL IF IT HAD NOT BEEN SO PAINFULLY CLEAN AS TO GIVE IT SOMETHING OF THE APPEARANCE OF AN UNUSED PARLOR ITS WINDOWS LOOKED EAST AND WEST THROUGH THE WEST ONE LOOKING OUT ON THE BACK YARD CAME A FLOOD OF MELLOW JUNE SUNLIGHT BUT THE EAST ONE
103-1240-0025 WHENCE YOU GOT A GLIMPSE OF THE BLOOM WHITE CHERRY TREES IN THE LEFT ORCHARD AND NODDING SLENDER BIRCHES DOWN IN THE HOLLOW BY THE BROOK WAS GREENED OVER BY A TANGLE OF VINES HERE SAT MARILLA CUTHBERT WHEN SHE SAT AT ALL ALWAYS SLIGHTLY DISTRUSTFUL OF SUNSHINE
103-1240-0026 AND HERE SHE SAT NOW KNITTING AND THE TABLE BEHIND HER WAS LAID FOR SUPPER MISSUS RACHEL BEFORE SHE HAD FAIRLY CLOSED THE DOOR
103-1240-0027 THERE WERE THREE PLATES LAID SO THAT MARILLA MUST BE EXPECTING SOME ONE HOME WITH MATTHEW TO TEA BUT THE DISHES WERE EVERYDAY DISHES AND THERE WAS ONLY CRAB APPLE PRESERVES AND ONE KIND OF CAKE SO THAT THE EXPECTED COMPANY COULD NOT BE ANY PARTICULAR COMPANY
103-1240-0028 YET WHAT OF MATTHEW'S WHITE COLLAR AND THE SORREL MARE MISSUS RACHEL WAS GETTING FAIRLY DIZZY WITH THIS UNUSUAL MYSTERY ABOUT QUIET UNMYSTERIOUS GREEN GABLES GOOD EVENING RACHEL MARILLA SAID BRISKLY THIS IS A REAL FINE EVENING ISN'T IT WON'T YOU SIT DOWN
103-1240-0029 HOW ARE ALL YOUR FOLKS SOMETHING THAT FOR LACK OF ANY OTHER NAME MIGHT BE CALLED FRIENDSHIP EXISTED AND ALWAYS HAD EXISTED BETWEEN MARILLA CUTHBERT AND MISSUS RACHEL IN SPITE OF OR PERHAPS BECAUSE OF THEIR DISSIMILARITY MARILLA WAS A TALL
103-1240-0030 THIN WOMAN WITH ANGLES AND WITHOUT CURVES HER DARK HAIR SHOWED SOME GRAY STREAKS AND WAS ALWAYS TWISTED UP IN A HARD LITTLE KNOT BEHIND WITH TWO WIRE HAIRPINS STUCK AGGRESSIVELY THROUGH IT SHE LOOKED LIKE A WOMAN OF NARROW EXPERIENCE AND RIGID CONSCIENCE WHICH SHE WAS
103-1240-0031 BUT THERE WAS A SAVING SOMETHING ABOUT HER MOUTH WHICH IF IT HAD BEEN EVER SO SLIGHTLY DEVELOPED MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED INDICATIVE OF A SENSE OF HUMOR WE'RE ALL PRETTY WELL SAID MISSUS RACHEL I WAS KIND OF AFRAID YOU WEREN'T THOUGH WHEN I SAW MATTHEW STARTING OFF TODAY I THOUGHT MAYBE HE WAS GOING TO THE DOCTOR'S
103-1240-0032 MARILLA'S LIPS TWITCHED UNDERSTANDINGLY SHE HAD EXPECTED MISSUS RACHEL UP SHE HAD KNOWN THAT THE SIGHT OF MATTHEW JAUNTING OFF SO UNACCOUNTABLY WOULD BE TOO MUCH FOR HER NEIGHBOR'S CURIOSITY OH NO I'M QUITE WELL ALTHOUGH I HAD A BAD HEADACHE YESTERDAY SHE SAID
103-1240-0033 MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER WE'RE GETTING A LITTLE BOY FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM IN NOVA SCOTIA AND HE'S COMING ON THE TRAIN TONIGHT IF MARILLA HAD SAID THAT MATTHEW HAD GONE TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET A KANGAROO FROM AUSTRALIA MISSUS RACHEL COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE ASTONISHED
103-1240-0034 SHE WAS ACTUALLY STRICKEN DUMB FOR FIVE SECONDS IT WAS UNSUPPOSABLE THAT MARILLA WAS MAKING FUN OF HER BUT MISSUS RACHEL WAS ALMOST FORCED TO SUPPOSE IT ARE YOU IN EARNEST MARILLA SHE DEMANDED WHEN VOICE RETURNED TO HER YES OF COURSE
103-1240-0035 SAID MARILLA AS IF GETTING BOYS FROM ORPHAN ASYLUMS IN NOVA SCOTIA WERE PART OF THE USUAL SPRING WORK ON ANY WELL REGULATED AVONLEA FARM INSTEAD OF BEING AN UNHEARD OF INNOVATION MISSUS RACHEL FELT THAT SHE HAD RECEIVED A SEVERE MENTAL JOLT SHE THOUGHT IN EXCLAMATION POINTS
103-1240-0036 MARILLA AND MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF ALL PEOPLE ADOPTING A BOY FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM WELL THE WORLD WAS CERTAINLY TURNING UPSIDE DOWN SHE WOULD BE SURPRISED AT NOTHING AFTER THIS NOTHING
103-1240-0037 WHAT ON EARTH PUT SUCH A NOTION INTO YOUR HEAD SHE DEMANDED DISAPPROVINGLY THIS HAD BEEN DONE WITHOUT HER ADVICE BEING ASKED AND MUST PERFORCE BE DISAPPROVED WELL WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT FOR SOME TIME ALL WINTER IN FACT RETURNED MARILLA
103-1240-0038 MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS UP HERE ONE DAY BEFORE CHRISTMAS AND SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO GET A LITTLE GIRL FROM THE ASYLUM OVER IN HOPETON IN THE SPRING
103-1240-0039 SO MATTHEW AND I HAVE TALKED IT OVER OFF AND ON EVER SINCE WE THOUGHT WE'D GET A BOY MATTHEW IS GETTING UP IN YEARS YOU KNOW HE'S SIXTY AND HE ISN'T SO SPRY AS HE ONCE WAS HIS HEART TROUBLES HIM A GOOD DEAL AND YOU KNOW HOW DESPERATE HARD IT'S GOT TO BE TO GET HIRED HELP
103-1240-0040 THERE'S NEVER ANYBODY TO BE HAD BUT THOSE STUPID HALF GROWN LITTLE FRENCH BOYS AND AS SOON AS YOU DO GET ONE BROKE INTO YOUR WAYS AND TAUGHT SOMETHING HE'S UP AND OFF TO THE LOBSTER CANNERIES OR THE STATES AT FIRST MATTHEW SUGGESTED GETTING A HOME BOY BUT I SAID NO FLAT TO THAT
103-1240-0041 THEY MAY BE ALL RIGHT I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT BUT NO LONDON STREET ARABS FOR ME I SAID GIVE ME A NATIVE BORN AT LEAST THERE'LL BE A RISK NO MATTER WHO WE GET BUT I'LL FEEL EASIER IN MY MIND AND SLEEP SOUNDER AT NIGHTS IF WE GET A BORN CANADIAN
103-1240-0042 SO IN THE END WE DECIDED TO ASK MISSUS SPENCER TO PICK US OUT ONE WHEN SHE WENT OVER TO GET HER LITTLE GIRL WE HEARD LAST WEEK SHE WAS GOING SO WE SENT HER WORD BY RICHARD SPENCER'S FOLKS AT CARMODY TO BRING US A SMART LIKELY BOY OF ABOUT TEN OR ELEVEN WE DECIDED THAT WOULD BE THE BEST AGE
103-1240-0043 OLD ENOUGH TO BE OF SOME USE IN DOING CHORES RIGHT OFF AND YOUNG ENOUGH TO BE TRAINED UP PROPER WE MEAN TO GIVE HIM A GOOD HOME AND SCHOOLING WE HAD A TELEGRAM FROM MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER TODAY THE MAIL MAN BROUGHT IT FROM THE STATION SAYING THEY WERE COMING ON THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN TONIGHT
103-1240-0044 SO MATTHEW WENT TO BRIGHT RIVER TO MEET HIM MISSUS SPENCER WILL DROP HIM OFF THERE OF COURSE SHE GOES ON TO WHITE SANDS STATION HERSELF MISSUS RACHEL PRIDED HERSELF ON ALWAYS SPEAKING HER MIND SHE PROCEEDED TO SPEAK IT NOW HAVING ADJUSTED HER MENTAL ATTITUDE TO THIS AMAZING PIECE OF NEWS
103-1240-0045 WELL MARILLA I'LL JUST TELL YOU PLAIN THAT I THINK YOU'RE DOING A MIGHTY FOOLISH THING A RISKY THING THAT'S WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GETTING YOU'RE BRINGING A STRANGE CHILD INTO YOUR HOUSE AND HOME AND YOU DON'T KNOW A SINGLE THING ABOUT HIM NOR WHAT HIS DISPOSITION IS LIKE NOR WHAT SORT OF PARENTS HE HAD
103-1240-0046 NOR HOW HE'S LIKELY TO TURN OUT WHY IT WAS ONLY LAST WEEK I READ IN THE PAPER HOW A MAN AND HIS WIFE UP WEST OF THE ISLAND TOOK A BOY OUT OF AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND HE SET FIRE TO THE HOUSE AT NIGHT SET IT ON PURPOSE MARILLA AND NEARLY BURNT THEM TO A CRISP IN THEIR BEDS
103-1240-0047 AND I KNOW ANOTHER CASE WHERE AN ADOPTED BOY USED TO SUCK THE EGGS THEY COULDN'T BREAK HIM OF IT IF YOU HAD ASKED MY ADVICE IN THE MATTER WHICH YOU DIDN'T DO MARILLA I'D HAVE SAID FOR MERCY'S SAKE NOT TO THINK OF SUCH A THING THAT'S WHAT
103-1240-0048 THIS JOB'S COMFORTING SEEMED NEITHER TO OFFEND NOR TO ALARM MARILLA SHE KNITTED STEADILY ON I DON'T DENY THERE'S SOMETHING IN WHAT YOU SAY RACHEL I'VE HAD SOME QUALMS MYSELF BUT MATTHEW WAS TERRIBLE SET ON IT I COULD SEE THAT SO I GAVE IN
103-1240-0049 IT'S SO SELDOM MATTHEW SETS HIS MIND ON ANYTHING THAT WHEN HE DOES I ALWAYS FEEL IT'S MY DUTY TO GIVE IN AND AS FOR THE RISK THERE'S RISKS IN PRETTY NEAR EVERYTHING A BODY DOES IN THIS WORLD THERE'S RISKS IN PEOPLE'S HAVING CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN IF IT COMES TO THAT THEY DON'T ALWAYS TURN OUT WELL
103-1240-0050 AND THEN NOVA SCOTIA IS RIGHT CLOSE TO THE ISLAND IT ISN'T AS IF WE WERE GETTING HIM FROM ENGLAND OR THE STATES HE CAN'T BE MUCH DIFFERENT FROM OURSELVES WELL I HOPE IT WILL TURN OUT ALL RIGHT SAID MISSUS RACHEL IN A TONE THAT PLAINLY INDICATED HER PAINFUL DOUBTS
103-1240-0051 ONLY DON'T SAY I DIDN'T WARN YOU IF HE BURNS GREEN GABLES DOWN OR PUTS STRYCHNINE IN THE WELL I HEARD OF A CASE OVER IN NEW BRUNSWICK WHERE AN ORPHAN ASYLUM CHILD DID THAT AND THE WHOLE FAMILY DIED IN FEARFUL AGONIES ONLY IT WAS A GIRL IN THAT INSTANCE WELL WE'RE NOT GETTING A GIRL SAID MARILLA
103-1240-0052 AS IF POISONING WELLS WERE A PURELY FEMININE ACCOMPLISHMENT AND NOT TO BE DREADED IN THE CASE OF A BOY I'D NEVER DREAM OF TAKING A GIRL TO BRING UP I WONDER AT MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER FOR DOING IT BUT THERE SHE WOULDN'T SHRINK FROM ADOPTING A WHOLE ORPHAN ASYLUM IF SHE TOOK IT INTO HER HEAD
103-1240-0053 MISSUS RACHEL WOULD HAVE LIKED TO STAY UNTIL MATTHEW CAME HOME WITH HIS IMPORTED ORPHAN BUT REFLECTING THAT IT WOULD BE A GOOD TWO HOURS AT LEAST BEFORE HIS ARRIVAL SHE CONCLUDED TO GO UP THE ROAD TO ROBERT BELL'S AND TELL THE NEWS IT WOULD CERTAINLY MAKE A SENSATION SECOND TO NONE
103-1240-0054 AND MISSUS RACHEL DEARLY LOVED TO MAKE A SENSATION SO SHE TOOK HERSELF AWAY SOMEWHAT TO MARILLA'S RELIEF FOR THE LATTER FELT HER DOUBTS AND FEARS REVIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF MISSUS RACHEL'S PESSIMISM WELL OF ALL THINGS THAT EVER WERE OR WILL BE EJACULATED MISSUS RACHEL WHEN SHE WAS SAFELY OUT IN THE LANE
103-1240-0055 IT DOES REALLY SEEM AS IF I MUST BE DREAMING WELL I'M SORRY FOR THAT POOR YOUNG ONE AND NO MISTAKE MATTHEW AND MARILLA DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT CHILDREN AND THEY'LL EXPECT HIM TO BE WISER AND STEADIER THAT HIS OWN GRANDFATHER
103-1240-0056 IT SEEMS UNCANNY TO THINK OF A CHILD AT GREEN GABLES SOMEHOW THERE'S NEVER BEEN ONE THERE FOR MATTHEW AND MARILLA WERE GROWN UP WHEN THE NEW HOUSE WAS BUILT IF THEY EVER WERE CHILDREN WHICH IS HARD TO BELIEVE WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THEM I WOULDN'T BE IN THAT ORPHAN'S SHOES FOR ANYTHING
103-1240-0057 MY BUT I PITY HIM THAT'S WHAT SO SAID MISSUS RACHEL TO THE WILD ROSE BUSHES OUT OF THE FULNESS OF HER HEART
103-1241-0000 CHAPTER TWO MATTHEW CUTHBERT IS SURPRISED MATTHEW CUTHBERT AND THE SORREL MARE JOGGED COMFORTABLY OVER THE EIGHT MILES TO BRIGHT RIVER IT WAS A PRETTY ROAD RUNNING ALONG BETWEEN SNUG FARMSTEADS WITH NOW AND AGAIN A BIT OF BALSAMY FIR WOOD TO DRIVE THROUGH
103-1241-0001 OR A HOLLOW WHERE WILD PLUMS HUNG OUT THEIR FILMY BLOOM THE AIR WAS SWEET WITH THE BREATH OF MANY APPLE ORCHARDS AND THE MEADOWS SLOPED AWAY IN THE DISTANCE TO HORIZON MISTS OF PEARL AND PURPLE WHILE THE LITTLE BIRDS SANG AS IF IT WERE THE ONE DAY OF SUMMER IN ALL THE YEAR
103-1241-0002 MATTHEW ENJOYED THE DRIVE AFTER HIS OWN FASHION EXCEPT DURING THE MOMENTS WHEN HE MET WOMEN AND HAD TO NOD TO THEM FOR IN PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO NOD TO ALL AND SUNDRY YOU MEET ON THE ROAD WHETHER YOU KNOW THEM OR NOT MATTHEW DREADED ALL WOMEN EXCEPT MARILLA AND MISSUS RACHEL
103-1241-0003 HE HAD AN UNCOMFORTABLE FEELING THAT THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURES WERE SECRETLY LAUGHING AT HIM HE MAY HAVE BEEN QUITE RIGHT IN THINKING SO FOR HE WAS AN ODD LOOKING PERSONAGE WITH AN UNGAINLY FIGURE AND LONG IRON GRAY HAIR THAT TOUCHED HIS STOOPING SHOULDERS
103-1241-0004 AND A FULL SOFT BROWN BEARD WHICH HE HAD WORN EVER SINCE HE WAS TWENTY IN FACT HE HAD LOOKED AT TWENTY VERY MUCH AS HE LOOKED AT SIXTY LACKING A LITTLE OF THE GRAYNESS WHEN HE REACHED BRIGHT RIVER THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY TRAIN
103-1241-0005 HE THOUGHT HE WAS TOO EARLY SO HE TIED HIS HORSE IN THE YARD OF THE SMALL BRIGHT RIVER HOTEL AND WENT OVER TO THE STATION HOUSE THE LONG PLATFORM WAS ALMOST DESERTED THE ONLY LIVING CREATURE IN SIGHT BEING A GIRL WHO WAS SITTING ON A PILE OF SHINGLES AT THE EXTREME END
103-1241-0006 MATTHEW BARELY NOTING THAT IT WAS A GIRL SIDLED PAST HER AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE WITHOUT LOOKING AT HER HAD HE LOOKED HE COULD HARDLY HAVE FAILED TO NOTICE THE TENSE RIGIDITY AND EXPECTATION OF HER ATTITUDE AND EXPRESSION SHE WAS SITTING THERE WAITING FOR SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY
103-1241-0007 AND SINCE SITTING AND WAITING WAS THE ONLY THING TO DO JUST THEN SHE SAT AND WAITED WITH ALL HER MIGHT AND MAIN MATTHEW ENCOUNTERED THE STATIONMASTER LOCKING UP THE TICKET OFFICE PREPARATORY TO GOING HOME FOR SUPPER AND ASKED HIM IF THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN WOULD SOON BE ALONG
103-1241-0008 THE FIVE THIRTY TRAIN HAS BEEN IN AND GONE HALF AN HOUR AGO ANSWERED THAT BRISK OFFICIAL BUT THERE WAS A PASSENGER DROPPED OFF FOR YOU A LITTLE GIRL SHE'S SITTING OUT THERE ON THE SHINGLES I ASKED HER TO GO INTO THE LADIES WAITING ROOM BUT SHE INFORMED ME GRAVELY THAT SHE PREFERRED TO STAY OUTSIDE
103-1241-0009 SHE'S A CASE I SHOULD SAY I'M NOT EXPECTING A GIRL SAID MATTHEW BLANKLY IT'S A BOY I'VE COME FOR HE SHOULD BE HERE MISSUS ALEXANDER SPENCER WAS TO BRING HIM OVER FROM NOVA SCOTIA FOR ME THE STATIONMASTER WHISTLED
103-1241-0010 GUESS THERE'S SOME MISTAKE HE SAID MISSUS SPENCER CAME OFF THE TRAIN WITH THAT GIRL AND GAVE HER INTO MY CHARGE SAID YOU AND YOUR SISTER WERE ADOPTING HER FROM AN ORPHAN ASYLUM AND THAT YOU WOULD BE ALONG FOR HER PRESENTLY THAT'S ALL I KNOW ABOUT IT AND I HAVEN'T GOT ANY MORE ORPHANS CONCEALED HEREABOUTS
103-1241-0011 I DON'T UNDERSTAND SAID MATTHEW HELPLESSLY WISHING THAT MARILLA WAS AT HAND TO COPE WITH THE SITUATION WELL YOU'D BETTER QUESTION THE GIRL SAID THE STATION MASTER CARELESSLY I DARE SAY SHE'LL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN SHE'S GOT A TONGUE OF HER OWN THAT'S CERTAIN
103-1241-0012 MAYBE THEY WERE OUT OF BOYS OF THE BRAND YOU WANTED HE WALKED JAUNTILY AWAY BEING HUNGRY AND THE UNFORTUNATE MATTHEW WAS LEFT TO DO THAT WHICH WAS HARDER FOR HIM THAN BEARDING A LION IN ITS DEN WALK UP TO A GIRL A STRANGE GIRL AN ORPHAN GIRL
103-1241-0013 AND DEMAND OF HER WHY SHE WASN'T A BOY MATTHEW GROANED IN SPIRIT AS HE TURNED ABOUT AND SHUFFLED GENTLY DOWN THE PLATFORM TOWARDS HER SHE HAD BEEN WATCHING HIM EVER SINCE HE HAD PASSED HER AND SHE HAD HER EYES ON HIM NOW MATTHEW WAS NOT LOOKING AT HER
103-1241-0014 A CHILD OF ABOUT ELEVEN GARBED IN A VERY SHORT VERY TIGHT VERY UGLY DRESS OF YELLOWISH GRAY WINCEY SHE WORE A FADED BROWN SAILOR HAT AND BENEATH THE HAT EXTENDING DOWN HER BACK WERE TWO BRAIDS OF VERY THICK DECIDEDLY RED HAIR
103-1241-0015 HER FACE WAS SMALL WHITE AND THIN ALSO MUCH FRECKLED HER MOUTH WAS LARGE AND SO WERE HER EYES WHICH LOOKED GREEN IN SOME LIGHTS AND MOODS AND GRAY IN OTHERS SO FAR THE ORDINARY OBSERVER AN EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER
103-1241-0016 MIGHT HAVE SEEN THAT THE CHIN WAS VERY POINTED AND PRONOUNCED THAT THE BIG EYES WERE FULL OF SPIRIT AND VIVACITY THAT THE MOUTH WAS SWEET LIPPED AND EXPRESSIVE THAT THE FOREHEAD WAS BROAD AND FULL IN SHORT OUR DISCERNING EXTRAORDINARY OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE CONCLUDED
103-1241-0017 WAS SO LUDICROUSLY AFRAID MATTHEW HOWEVER WAS SPARED THE ORDEAL OF SPEAKING FIRST FOR AS SOON AS SHE CONCLUDED THAT HE WAS COMING TO HER SHE STOOD UP GRASPING WITH ONE THIN BROWN HAND THE HANDLE OF A SHABBY OLD FASHIONED CARPET BAG THE OTHER SHE HELD OUT TO HIM
103-1241-0018 I SUPPOSE YOU ARE MISTER MATTHEW CUTHBERT OF GREEN GABLES SHE SAID IN A PECULIARLY CLEAR SWEET VOICE I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU I WAS BEGINNING TO BE AFRAID YOU WEREN'T COMING FOR ME
103-1241-0019 I HAD MADE UP MY MIND THAT IF YOU DIDN'T COME FOR ME TO NIGHT
103-1241-0020 I WOULDN'T BE A BIT AFRAID AND IT WOULD BE LOVELY TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE ALL WHITE WITH BLOOM IN THE MOONSHINE DON'T YOU THINK YOU COULD IMAGINE YOU WERE DWELLING IN MARBLE HALLS COULDN'T YOU
103-1241-0021 MATTHEW HAD TAKEN THE SCRAWNY LITTLE HAND AWKWARDLY IN HIS THEN AND THERE HE DECIDED WHAT TO DO HE COULD NOT TELL THIS CHILD WITH THE GLOWING EYES THAT THERE HAD BEEN A MISTAKE HE WOULD TAKE HER HOME AND LET MARILLA DO THAT SHE COULDN'T BE LEFT AT BRIGHT RIVER ANYHOW
103-1241-0022 NO MATTER WHAT MISTAKE HAD BEEN MADE SO ALL QUESTIONS AND EXPLANATIONS MIGHT AS WELL BE DEFERRED UNTIL HE WAS SAFELY BACK AT GREEN GABLES I'M SORRY I WAS LATE HE SAID SHYLY COME ALONG THE HORSE IS OVER IN THE YARD GIVE ME YOUR BAG OH I CAN CARRY IT THE CHILD RESPONDED CHEERFULLY
103-1241-0023 IT ISN'T HEAVY I'VE GOT ALL MY WORLDLY GOODS IN IT BUT IT ISN'T HEAVY AND IF IT ISN'T CARRIED IN JUST A CERTAIN WAY THE HANDLE PULLS OUT SO I'D BETTER KEEP IT BECAUSE I KNOW THE EXACT KNACK OF IT IT'S AN EXTREMELY OLD CARPET BAG OH I'M VERY GLAD YOU'VE COME EVEN IF IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO SLEEP IN A WILD CHERRY TREE
103-1241-0024 WE'VE GOT TO DRIVE A LONG PIECE HAVEN'T WE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS EIGHT MILES I'M GLAD BECAUSE I LOVE DRIVING OH IT SEEMS SO WONDERFUL THAT I'M GOING TO LIVE WITH YOU AND BELONG TO YOU I'VE NEVER BELONGED TO ANYBODY NOT REALLY BUT THE ASYLUM WAS THE WORST I'VE ONLY BEEN IN IT FOUR MONTHS BUT THAT WAS ENOUGH
103-1241-0025 IT'S WORSE THAN ANYTHING YOU COULD IMAGINE MISSUS SPENCER SAID IT WAS WICKED OF ME TO TALK LIKE THAT
103-1241-0026 THEY WERE GOOD YOU KNOW THE ASYLUM PEOPLE BUT THERE IS SO LITTLE SCOPE FOR THE IMAGINATION IN AN ASYLUM ONLY JUST IN THE OTHER ORPHANS IT WAS PRETTY INTERESTING TO IMAGINE THINGS ABOUT THEM
103-1241-0027 WHO HAD BEEN STOLEN AWAY FROM HER PARENTS IN HER INFANCY BY A CRUEL NURSE WHO DIED BEFORE SHE COULD CONFESS I USED TO LIE AWAKE AT NIGHTS AND IMAGINE THINGS LIKE THAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE TIME IN THE DAY I GUESS THAT'S WHY I'M SO THIN I AM DREADFUL THIN AIN'T I THERE ISN'T A PICK ON MY BONES
103-1241-0028 I DO LOVE TO IMAGINE I'M NICE AND PLUMP WITH DIMPLES IN MY ELBOWS WITH THIS MATTHEW'S COMPANION STOPPED TALKING PARTLY BECAUSE SHE WAS OUT OF BREATH AND PARTLY BECAUSE THEY HAD REACHED THE BUGGY NOT ANOTHER WORD DID SHE SAY UNTIL THEY HAD LEFT THE VILLAGE AND WERE DRIVING DOWN A STEEP LITTLE HILL
103-1241-0029 THE ROAD PART OF WHICH HAD BEEN CUT SO DEEPLY INTO THE SOFT SOIL THAT THE BANKS FRINGED WITH BLOOMING WILD CHERRY TREES AND SLIM WHITE BIRCHES WERE SEVERAL FEET ABOVE THEIR HEADS THE CHILD PUT OUT HER HAND AND BROKE OFF A BRANCH OF WILD PLUM THAT BRUSHED AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE BUGGY
103-1241-0030 ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL WHAT DID THAT TREE LEANING OUT FROM THE BANK ALL WHITE AND LACY MAKE YOU THINK OF SHE ASKED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW WHY A BRIDE OF COURSE A BRIDE ALL IN WHITE WITH A LOVELY MISTY VEIL
103-1241-0031 I'VE NEVER SEEN ONE BUT I CAN IMAGINE WHAT SHE WOULD LOOK LIKE I DON'T EVER EXPECT TO BE A BRIDE MYSELF I'M SO HOMELY NOBODY WILL EVER WANT TO MARRY ME UNLESS IT MIGHT BE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY I SUPPOSE A FOREIGN MISSIONARY MIGHTN'T BE VERY PARTICULAR
103-1241-0032 BUT I DO HOPE THAT SOME DAY I SHALL HAVE A WHITE DRESS THAT IS MY HIGHEST IDEAL OF EARTHLY BLISS I JUST LOVE PRETTY CLOTHES AND I'VE NEVER HAD A PRETTY DRESS IN MY LIFE THAT I CAN REMEMBER BUT OF COURSE IT'S ALL THE MORE TO LOOK FORWARD TO ISN'T IT AND THEN
103-1241-0033 I CAN IMAGINE THAT I'M DRESSED GORGEOUSLY THIS MORNING WHEN I LEFT THE ASYLUM I FELT SO ASHAMED BECAUSE I HAD TO WEAR THIS HORRID OLD WINCEY DRESS ALL THE ORPHANS HAD TO WEAR THEM YOU KNOW A MERCHANT IN HOPETON LAST WINTER DONATED THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF WINCEY TO THE ASYLUM SOME PEOPLE SAID IT WAS BECAUSE HE COULDN'T SELL IT
103-1241-0034 BUT I'D RATHER BELIEVE THAT IT WAS OUT OF THE KINDNESS OF HIS HEART WOULDN'T YOU WHEN WE GOT ON THE TRAIN I FELT AS IF EVERYBODY MUST BE LOOKING AT ME AND PITYING ME BUT I JUST WENT TO WORK AND IMAGINED THAT I HAD ON THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PALE BLUE SILK DRESS BECAUSE WHEN YOU ARE IMAGINING YOU MIGHT AS WELL IMAGINE SOMETHING WORTH WHILE
103-1241-0035 AND A BIG HAT ALL FLOWERS AND NODDING PLUMES AND A GOLD WATCH AND KID GLOVES AND BOOTS I FELT CHEERED UP RIGHT AWAY AND I ENJOYED MY TRIP TO THE ISLAND WITH ALL MY MIGHT I WASN'T A BIT SICK COMING OVER IN THE BOAT NEITHER WAS MISSUS SPENCER ALTHOUGH SHE GENERALLY IS
103-1241-0036 SHE SAID SHE HADN'T TIME TO GET SICK WATCHING TO SEE THAT I DIDN'T FALL OVERBOARD SHE SAID SHE NEVER SAW THE BEAT OF ME FOR PROWLING ABOUT BUT IF IT KEPT HER FROM BEING SEASICK IT'S A MERCY I DID PROWL ISN'T IT AND I WANTED TO SEE EVERYTHING THAT WAS TO BE SEEN ON THAT BOAT BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHETHER I'D EVER HAVE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY
103-1241-0037 OH THERE ARE A LOT MORE CHERRY TREES ALL IN BLOOM THIS ISLAND IS THE BLOOMIEST PLACE I JUST LOVE IT ALREADY AND I'M SO GLAD I'M GOING TO LIVE HERE I'VE ALWAYS HEARD THAT PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND WAS THE PRETTIEST PLACE IN THE WORLD
103-1241-0038 AND I USED TO IMAGINE I WAS LIVING HERE BUT I NEVER REALLY EXPECTED I WOULD IT'S DELIGHTFUL WHEN YOUR IMAGINATIONS COME TRUE ISN'T IT BUT THOSE RED ROADS ARE SO FUNNY WHEN WE GOT INTO THE TRAIN AT CHARLOTTETOWN AND THE RED ROADS BEGAN TO FLASH PAST I ASKED MISSUS SPENCER WHAT MADE THEM RED
103-1241-0039 AND SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW AND FOR PITY'S SAKE NOT TO ASK HER ANY MORE QUESTIONS SHE SAID I MUST HAVE ASKED HER A THOUSAND ALREADY I SUPPOSE I HAD TOO BUT HOW YOU GOING TO FIND OUT ABOUT THINGS IF YOU DON'T ASK QUESTIONS AND WHAT DOES MAKE THE ROADS RED WELL NOW I DUNNO SAID MATTHEW
103-1241-0040 THERE'D BE NO SCOPE FOR IMAGINATION THEN WOULD THERE BUT AM I TALKING TOO MUCH PEOPLE ARE ALWAYS TELLING ME I DO WOULD YOU RATHER I DIDN'T TALK IF YOU SAY SO I'LL STOP I CAN STOP WHEN I MAKE UP MY MIND TO IT ALTHOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT MATTHEW
103-1241-0041 WAS ENJOYING HIMSELF LIKE MOST QUIET FOLKS HE LIKED TALKATIVE PEOPLE WHEN THEY WERE WILLING TO DO THE TALKING THEMSELVES AND DID NOT EXPECT HIM TO KEEP UP HIS END OF IT BUT HE HAD NEVER EXPECTED TO ENJOY THE SOCIETY OF A LITTLE GIRL WOMEN WERE BAD ENOUGH IN ALL CONSCIENCE BUT LITTLE GIRLS WERE WORSE
103-1241-0042 HE DETESTED THE WAY THEY HAD OF SIDLING PAST HIM TIMIDLY WITH SIDEWISE GLANCES AS IF THEY EXPECTED HIM TO GOBBLE THEM UP AT A MOUTHFUL IF THEY VENTURED TO SAY A WORD THAT WAS THE AVONLEA TYPE OF WELL BRED LITTLE GIRL BUT THIS FRECKLED WITCH WAS VERY DIFFERENT
103-1241-0043 AND ALTHOUGH HE FOUND IT RATHER DIFFICULT FOR HIS SLOWER INTELLIGENCE TO KEEP UP WITH HER BRISK MENTAL PROCESSES
1034-121119-0000 CHAPTER NINETY NINE THE LAW WE HAVE SEEN HOW QUIETLY
1034-121119-0001 THE FACT BEING THAT EVERY ONE WAS TOO MUCH OCCUPIED IN HIS OR HER OWN AFFAIRS TO THINK OF THEIRS WE WILL LEAVE THE BANKER CONTEMPLATING THE ENORMOUS MAGNITUDE OF HIS DEBT BEFORE THE PHANTOM OF BANKRUPTCY AND FOLLOW THE BARONESS
1034-121119-0002 WHO AFTER BEING MOMENTARILY CRUSHED UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THE BLOW WHICH HAD STRUCK HER HAD GONE TO SEEK HER USUAL ADVISER LUCIEN DEBRAY THE BARONESS HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THIS MARRIAGE AS A MEANS OF RIDDING HER OF A GUARDIANSHIP WHICH OVER A GIRL OF EUGENIE'S CHARACTER
1034-121119-0003 FOR IN THE TACIT RELATIONS WHICH MAINTAIN THE BOND OF FAMILY UNION THE MOTHER TO MAINTAIN HER ASCENDANCY OVER HER DAUGHTER MUST NEVER FAIL TO BE A MODEL OF WISDOM AND A TYPE OF PERFECTION NOW
1034-121119-0004 AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED TO IMPLY THAT SHE UNDERSTOOD ALL HER MOTHER'S AMOROUS AND PECUNIARY RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE INTIMATE SECRETARY MOREOVER
1034-121119-0005 NOT ONLY BECAUSE HE WAS A SOURCE OF DISSENSION AND SCANDAL UNDER THE PATERNAL ROOF BUT BECAUSE SHE HAD AT ONCE CLASSED HIM IN THAT CATALOGUE OF BIPEDS WHOM PLATO ENDEAVORS TO WITHDRAW FROM THE APPELLATION OF MEN
1034-121119-0006 UNFORTUNATELY IN THIS WORLD OF OURS EACH PERSON VIEWS THINGS THROUGH A CERTAIN MEDIUM AND SO IS PREVENTED FROM SEEING IN THE SAME LIGHT AS OTHERS AND MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE VERY MUCH REGRETTED THAT THE MARRIAGE OF EUGENIE HAD NOT TAKEN PLACE
1034-121119-0007 NOT ONLY BECAUSE THE MATCH WAS GOOD AND LIKELY TO INSURE THE HAPPINESS OF HER CHILD BUT BECAUSE IT WOULD ALSO SET HER AT LIBERTY SHE RAN THEREFORE TO DEBRAY WHO AFTER HAVING LIKE THE REST OF PARIS WITNESSED THE CONTRACT SCENE AND THE SCANDAL ATTENDING IT
1034-121119-0008 HAD RETIRED IN HASTE TO HIS CLUB WHERE HE WAS CHATTING WITH SOME FRIENDS UPON THE EVENTS WHICH SERVED AS A SUBJECT OF CONVERSATION FOR THREE FOURTHS OF THAT CITY KNOWN AS THE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD AT THE PRECISE TIME WHEN MADAME DANGLARS DRESSED IN BLACK AND CONCEALED IN A LONG VEIL
1034-121119-0009 WAS ASCENDING THE STAIRS LEADING TO DEBRAY'S APARTMENTS
1034-121119-0010 DEBRAY WAS OCCUPIED IN REPELLING THE INSINUATIONS OF A FRIEND WHO TRIED TO PERSUADE HIM
1034-121119-0011 STILL WHEN HE RECOLLECTED THE INDEPENDENT PROUD SPIRIT OF EUGENIE HE POSITIVELY REJECTED IT AS UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE THOUGH THE SAME THOUGHT AGAIN CONTINUALLY RECURRED AND FOUND A RESTING PLACE IN HIS HEART TEA PLAY
1034-121119-0012 AND THE CONVERSATION WHICH HAD BECOME INTERESTING DURING THE DISCUSSION OF SUCH SERIOUS AFFAIRS
1034-121119-0013 AWAITED THE RETURN OF DEBRAY IN THE LITTLE GREEN ROOM SEATED BETWEEN TWO BASKETS OF FLOWERS WHICH SHE HAD THAT MORNING SENT AND WHICH IT MUST BE CONFESSED
1034-121119-0014 WITH SO MUCH CARE THAT HIS ABSENCE WAS HALF EXCUSED IN THE EYES OF THE POOR WOMAN AT TWENTY MINUTES OF TWELVE MADAME DANGLARS TIRED OF WAITING RETURNED HOME WOMEN OF A CERTAIN GRADE ARE LIKE PROSPEROUS GRISETTES IN ONE RESPECT THEY SELDOM RETURN HOME AFTER TWELVE O'CLOCK
1034-121119-0015 THE BARONESS RETURNED TO THE HOTEL WITH AS MUCH CAUTION AS EUGENIE USED IN LEAVING IT SHE RAN LIGHTLY UP STAIRS AND WITH AN ACHING HEART ENTERED HER APARTMENT CONTIGUOUS AS WE KNOW TO THAT OF EUGENIE SHE WAS FEARFUL OF EXCITING ANY REMARK
1034-121119-0016 AND BELIEVED FIRMLY IN HER DAUGHTER'S INNOCENCE AND FIDELITY TO THE PATERNAL ROOF SHE LISTENED AT EUGENIE'S DOOR AND HEARING NO SOUND TRIED TO ENTER BUT THE BOLTS WERE IN PLACE MADAME DANGLARS THEN CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG GIRL HAD BEEN OVERCOME WITH THE TERRIBLE EXCITEMENT OF THE EVENING
1034-121119-0017 AND HAD GONE TO BED AND TO SLEEP SHE CALLED THE MAID AND QUESTIONED HER MADEMOISELLE EUGENIE SAID THE MAID
1034-121119-0018 AFTER WHICH THEY DESIRED ME TO LEAVE SAYING THAT THEY NEEDED ME NO LONGER
1034-121119-0019 MADAME DANGLARS THEREFORE WENT TO BED WITHOUT A SHADOW OF SUSPICION AND BEGAN TO MUSE OVER THE RECENT EVENTS IN PROPORTION AS HER MEMORY BECAME CLEARER THE OCCURRENCES OF THE EVENING WERE REVEALED IN THEIR TRUE LIGHT WHAT SHE HAD TAKEN FOR CONFUSION WAS A TUMULT
1034-121119-0020 WHO HAD BEEN AFFLICTED WITH AS SEVERE A BLOW THROUGH HER HUSBAND AND SON EUGENIE SHE SAID TO HERSELF IS LOST AND SO ARE WE THE AFFAIR AS IT WILL BE REPORTED WILL COVER US WITH SHAME
1034-121119-0021 FOR IN A SOCIETY SUCH AS OURS SATIRE INFLICTS A PAINFUL AND INCURABLE WOUND
1034-121119-0022 AND HER GLANCE WAS TURNED TOWARDS HEAVEN
1034-121119-0023 AND OUT OF A FAULT NAY EVEN A VICE SOMETIMES PRODUCES A BLESSING AND THEN HER THOUGHTS CLEAVING THROUGH SPACE LIKE A BIRD IN THE AIR RESTED ON CAVALCANTI THIS ANDREA WAS A WRETCH A ROBBER AN ASSASSIN
1034-121119-0024 AND YET HIS MANNERS SHOWED THE EFFECTS OF A SORT OF EDUCATION IF NOT A COMPLETE ONE
1034-121119-0025 SUPPORTED BY AN HONORABLE NAME HOW COULD SHE EXTRICATE HERSELF FROM THIS LABYRINTH TO WHOM WOULD SHE APPLY TO HELP HER OUT OF THIS PAINFUL SITUATION DEBRAY TO WHOM SHE HAD RUN WITH THE FIRST INSTINCT OF A WOMAN TOWARDS THE MAN SHE LOVES AND WHO YET BETRAYS HER
1034-121119-0026 DEBRAY COULD BUT GIVE HER ADVICE SHE MUST APPLY TO SOME ONE MORE POWERFUL THAN HE
1034-121119-0027 BUT NO ON REFLECTION THE PROCUREUR WAS NOT A MERCILESS MAN AND IT WAS NOT THE MAGISTRATE SLAVE TO HIS DUTIES BUT THE FRIEND THE LOYAL FRIEND WHO ROUGHLY BUT FIRMLY CUT INTO THE VERY CORE OF THE CORRUPTION
1034-121119-0028 IT WAS NOT THE EXECUTIONER BUT THE SURGEON WHO WISHED TO WITHDRAW THE HONOR OF DANGLARS FROM IGNOMINIOUS ASSOCIATION WITH THE DISGRACED YOUNG MAN THEY HAD PRESENTED TO THE WORLD AS THEIR SON IN LAW AND SINCE VILLEFORT THE FRIEND OF DANGLARS HAD ACTED IN THIS WAY
1034-121119-0029 NO ONE COULD SUPPOSE THAT HE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACQUAINTED WITH OR HAD LENT HIMSELF TO ANY OF ANDREA'S INTRIGUES
1034-121119-0030 APPEARED TO THE BARONESS AS IF SHAPED FOR THEIR MUTUAL ADVANTAGE BUT THE INFLEXIBILITY OF THE PROCUREUR SHOULD STOP THERE SHE WOULD SEE HIM THE NEXT DAY AND IF SHE COULD NOT MAKE HIM FAIL IN HIS DUTIES AS A MAGISTRATE SHE WOULD AT LEAST
1034-121119-0031 OBTAIN ALL THE INDULGENCE HE COULD ALLOW SHE WOULD INVOKE THE PAST RECALL OLD RECOLLECTIONS SHE WOULD SUPPLICATE HIM BY THE REMEMBRANCE OF GUILTY YET HAPPY DAYS
1034-121119-0032 HE HAD ONLY TO TURN HIS EYES ON ONE SIDE AND ALLOW ANDREA TO FLY AND FOLLOW UP THE CRIME UNDER THAT SHADOW OF GUILT CALLED CONTEMPT OF COURT AND AFTER THIS REASONING SHE SLEPT EASILY
1034-121119-0033 AT NINE O'CLOCK NEXT MORNING SHE AROSE AND WITHOUT RINGING FOR HER MAID OR GIVING THE LEAST SIGN OF HER ACTIVITY SHE DRESSED HERSELF IN THE SAME SIMPLE STYLE AS ON THE PREVIOUS NIGHT THEN RUNNING DOWN STAIRS SHE LEFT THE HOTEL WALKED TO THE RUE DE PROVENCE
1034-121119-0034 FOR THE LAST MONTH THIS WRETCHED HOUSE HAD PRESENTED THE GLOOMY APPEARANCE OF A LAZARETTO INFECTED WITH THE PLAGUE SOME OF THE APARTMENTS WERE CLOSED WITHIN AND WITHOUT THE SHUTTERS WERE ONLY OPENED TO ADMIT A MINUTE'S AIR SHOWING THE SCARED FACE OF A FOOTMAN
1034-121119-0035 AND THE NEIGHBORS WOULD SAY TO EACH OTHER IN A LOW VOICE
1034-121119-0036 MADAME DANGLARS INVOLUNTARILY SHUDDERED AT THE DESOLATE ASPECT OF THE MANSION
1034-121119-0037 THREE TIMES DID THE BELL RING WITH A DULL HEAVY SOUND SEEMING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GENERAL SADNESS BEFORE THE CONCIERGE APPEARED AND PEEPED THROUGH THE DOOR WHICH HE OPENED JUST WIDE ENOUGH TO ALLOW HIS WORDS TO BE HEARD

1040-133433-0001 THEY WENT UP BY THE STAIR BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THIS WOULD MAKE A BETTER IMPRESSION THEY STOOD IN A ROW IN FRONT OF MISSUS DARLING WITH THEIR HATS OFF AND WISHING THEY WERE NOT WEARING THEIR PIRATE CLOTHES THEY SAID NOTHING BUT THEIR EYES ASKED HER TO HAVE THEM
1040-133433-0002 BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT HIM OF COURSE MISSUS DARLING SAID AT ONCE THAT SHE WOULD HAVE THEM BUT MISTER DARLING WAS CURIOUSLY DEPRESSED AND THEY SAW THAT HE CONSIDERED SIX A RATHER LARGE NUMBER I MUST SAY HE SAID TO WENDY
1040-133433-0003 THAT YOU DON'T DO THINGS BY HALVES A GRUDGING REMARK WHICH THE TWINS THOUGHT WAS POINTED AT THEM THE FIRST TWIN WAS THE PROUD ONE AND HE ASKED FLUSHING DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD BE TOO MUCH OF A HANDFUL SIR BECAUSE IF SO WE CAN GO AWAY

1040-133433-0005 GEORGE MISSUS DARLING EXCLAIMED PAINED TO SEE HER DEAR ONE SHOWING HIMSELF IN SUCH AN UNFAVOURABLE LIGHT THEN HE BURST INTO TEARS AND THE TRUTH CAME OUT HE WAS AS GLAD TO HAVE THEM AS SHE WAS HE SAID
1040-133433-0006 BUT HE THOUGHT THEY SHOULD HAVE ASKED HIS CONSENT AS WELL AS HERS
1040-133433-0007 I DON'T THINK HE IS A CYPHER TOOTLES CRIED INSTANTLY DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER CURLY NO I DON'T DO YOU THINK HE IS A CYPHER SLIGHTLY RATHER NOT TWIN WHAT DO YOU THINK
1040-133433-0008 IT TURNED OUT THAT NOT ONE OF THEM THOUGHT HIM A CYPHER AND HE WAS ABSURDLY GRATIFIED AND SAID HE WOULD FIND SPACE FOR THEM ALL IN THE DRAWING ROOM IF THEY FITTED IN WE'LL FIT IN SIR THEY ASSURED HIM THEN FOLLOW THE LEADER HE CRIED GAILY
1040-133433-0009 MIND YOU I AM NOT SURE THAT WE HAVE A DRAWING ROOM BUT WE PRETEND WE HAVE AND IT'S ALL THE SAME HOOP LA HE WENT OFF DANCING THROUGH THE HOUSE AND THEY ALL CRIED HOOP LA AND DANCED AFTER HIM SEARCHING FOR THE DRAWING ROOM AND I FORGET WHETHER THEY FOUND IT
1040-133433-0010 BUT AT ANY RATE THEY FOUND CORNERS AND THEY ALL FITTED IN AS FOR PETER HE SAW WENDY ONCE AGAIN BEFORE HE FLEW AWAY HE DID NOT EXACTLY COME TO THE WINDOW BUT HE BRUSHED AGAINST IT IN PASSING SO THAT SHE COULD OPEN IT IF SHE LIKED AND CALL TO HIM
1040-133433-0011 THAT IS WHAT SHE DID HULLO WENDY GOOD BYE HE SAID OH DEAR ARE YOU GOING AWAY YES YOU DON'T FEEL PETER SHE SAID FALTERINGLY
1040-133433-0012 THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SAY ANYTHING TO MY PARENTS ABOUT A VERY SWEET SUBJECT NO ABOUT ME PETER NO MISSUS DARLING CAME TO THE WINDOW

1040-133433-0018 I SHALL HAVE TINK TINK CAN'T GO A TWENTIETH PART OF THE WAY ROUND SHE REMINDED HIM A LITTLE TARTLY
1040-133433-0019 TINK CALLED OUT FROM SOMEWHERE ROUND THE CORNER IT DOESN'T MATTER PETER SAID O PETER YOU KNOW IT MATTERS

1040-133433-0021 LONG IN COMING BUT THIS PROMISE SENT PETER AWAY QUITE GAY AGAIN
1040-133433-0022 I SUPPOSE IT WAS BECAUSE WENDY KNEW THIS THAT HER LAST WORDS TO HIM WERE THESE RATHER PLAINTIVE ONES YOU WON'T FORGET ME PETER WILL YOU BEFORE SPRING CLEANING TIME COMES OF COURSE PETER PROMISED AND THEN HE FLEW AWAY HE TOOK MISSUS DARLING'S KISS WITH HIM
1040-133433-0023 THE KISS THAT HAD BEEN FOR NO ONE ELSE PETER TOOK QUITE EASILY FUNNY BUT SHE SEEMED SATISFIED OF COURSE ALL THE BOYS WENT TO SCHOOL
1040-133433-0024 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE NOW AND SOON THEY SETTLED DOWN TO BEING AS ORDINARY AS YOU OR ME OR JENKINS MINOR
1040-133433-0025 IN TIME THEY COULD NOT EVEN FLY AFTER THEIR HATS WANT OF PRACTICE THEY CALLED IT BUT WHAT IT REALLY MEANT WAS THAT THEY NO LONGER BELIEVED MICHAEL BELIEVED LONGER THAN THE OTHER BOYS
1040-133433-0026 THOUGH THEY JEERED AT HIM SO HE WAS WITH WENDY WHEN PETER CAME FOR HER AT THE END OF THE FIRST YEAR SHE FLEW AWAY WITH PETER IN THE FROCK SHE HAD WOVEN FROM LEAVES AND BERRIES IN THE NEVERLAND AND HER ONE FEAR WAS THAT HE MIGHT NOTICE HOW SHORT IT HAD BECOME BUT HE NEVER NOTICED HE HAD SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT HIMSELF
1040-133433-0027 SHE HAD LOOKED FORWARD TO THRILLING TALKS WITH HIM ABOUT OLD TIMES BUT NEW ADVENTURES HAD CROWDED THE OLD ONES FROM HIS MIND WHO IS CAPTAIN HOOK
1040-133433-0028 WHEN SHE SPOKE OF THE ARCH ENEMY DON'T YOU REMEMBER SHE ASKED AMAZED HOW YOU KILLED HIM AND SAVED ALL OUR LIVES I FORGET THEM AFTER I KILL THEM HE REPLIED CARELESSLY WHEN SHE EXPRESSED A DOUBTFUL HOPE THAT TINKER BELL WOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HER HE SAID
1040-133433-0029 WHO IS TINKER BELL O PETER SHE SAID SHOCKED BUT EVEN WHEN SHE EXPLAINED HE COULD NOT REMEMBER THERE ARE SUCH A LOT OF THEM HE SAID I EXPECT SHE IS NO MORE I EXPECT HE WAS RIGHT FOR FAIRIES DON'T LIVE LONG
1040-133433-0030 BUT THEY ARE SO LITTLE THAT A SHORT TIME SEEMS A GOOD WHILE TO THEM WENDY WAS PAINED TOO TO FIND THAT THE PAST YEAR WAS BUT AS YESTERDAY TO PETER
1040-133433-0031 BUT HE WAS EXACTLY AS FASCINATING AS EVER AND THEY HAD A LOVELY SPRING CLEANING IN THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE TREE TOPS NEXT YEAR HE DID NOT COME FOR HER SHE WAITED IN A NEW FROCK BECAUSE THE OLD ONE SIMPLY WOULD NOT MEET BUT HE NEVER CAME
1040-133433-0032 PERHAPS HE IS ILL MICHAEL SAID YOU KNOW HE IS NEVER ILL MICHAEL CAME CLOSE TO HER AND WHISPERED WITH A SHIVER PERHAPS THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON WENDY AND THEN WENDY WOULD HAVE CRIED IF MICHAEL HAD NOT BEEN CRYING
1040-133433-0033 PETER CAME NEXT SPRING CLEANING AND THE STRANGE THING WAS THAT HE NEVER KNEW HE HAD MISSED A YEAR THAT WAS THE LAST TIME THE GIRL WENDY EVER SAW HIM FOR A LITTLE LONGER SHE TRIED FOR HIS SAKE NOT TO HAVE GROWING PAINS
1040-133433-0034 AND SHE FELT SHE WAS UNTRUE TO HIM WHEN SHE GOT A PRIZE FOR GENERAL KNOWLEDGE BUT THE YEARS CAME AND WENT WITHOUT BRINGING THE CARELESS BOY AND WHEN THEY MET AGAIN WENDY WAS A MARRIED WOMAN AND PETER WAS NO MORE TO HER
1040-133433-0035 THAN A LITTLE DUST IN THE BOX IN WHICH SHE HAD KEPT HER TOYS WENDY WAS GROWN UP YOU NEED NOT BE SORRY FOR HER SHE WAS ONE OF THE KIND THAT LIKES TO GROW UP IN THE END SHE GREW UP OF HER OWN FREE WILL A DAY QUICKER THAN OTHER GIRLS
1040-133433-0036 ALL THE BOYS WERE GROWN UP AND DONE FOR BY THIS TIME SO IT IS SCARCELY WORTH WHILE SAYING ANYTHING MORE ABOUT THEM YOU MAY SEE THE TWINS AND NIBS AND CURLY ANY DAY GOING TO AN OFFICE EACH CARRYING A LITTLE BAG AND AN UMBRELLA
1040-133433-0037 YOU SEE THAT JUDGE IN A WIG COMING OUT AT THE IRON DOOR THAT USED TO BE TOOTLES THE BEARDED MAN WHO DOESN'T KNOW ANY STORY TO TELL HIS CHILDREN
1040-133433-0038 AND ALWAYS HAD AN ODD INQUIRING LOOK
1040-133433-0039 WHEN SHE WAS OLD ENOUGH TO ASK THEM THEY WERE MOSTLY ABOUT PETER PAN SHE LOVED TO HEAR OF PETER AND WENDY TOLD HER ALL SHE COULD REMEMBER IN THE VERY NURSERY FROM WHICH THE FAMOUS FLIGHT HAD TAKEN PLACE
1040-133433-0040 WHO WAS NO LONGER FOND OF STAIRS MISSUS DARLING WAS NOW DEAD AND FORGOTTEN THERE WERE ONLY TWO BEDS IN THE NURSERY NOW JANE'S AND HER NURSE'S AND THERE WAS NO KENNEL FOR NANA ALSO HAD PASSED AWAY
1040-133433-0041 SHE DIED OF OLD AGE AND AT THE END SHE HAD BEEN RATHER DIFFICULT TO GET ON WITH BEING VERY FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT NO ONE KNEW HOW TO LOOK AFTER CHILDREN EXCEPT HERSELF ONCE A WEEK JANE'S NURSE HAD HER EVENING OFF
1040-133433-0042 AND THEN IT WAS WENDY'S PART TO PUT JANE TO BED THAT WAS THE TIME FOR STORIES IT WAS JANE'S INVENTION TO RAISE THE SHEET OVER HER MOTHER'S HEAD AND HER OWN THUS MAKING A TENT
1040-133433-0043 I DON'T THINK I SEE ANYTHING TO NIGHT SAYS WENDY WITH A FEELING THAT IF NANA WERE HERE SHE WOULD OBJECT TO FURTHER CONVERSATION YES YOU DO SAYS JANE
1040-133433-0044 THAT IS A LONG TIME AGO SWEETHEART SAYS WENDY AH ME HOW TIME FLIES DOES IT FLY ASKS THE ARTFUL CHILD THE WAY YOU FLEW WHEN YOU WERE A LITTLE GIRL
1040-133433-0045 WHY CAN'T YOU FLY NOW MOTHER BECAUSE I AM GROWN UP DEAREST WHEN PEOPLE GROW UP THEY FORGET THE WAY WHY DO THEY FORGET THE WAY BECAUSE THEY ARE NO LONGER GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0046 IT IS ONLY THE GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS WHO CAN FLY WHAT IS GAY AND INNOCENT AND HEARTLESS
1040-133433-0047 OR PERHAPS WENDY ADMITS SHE DOES SEE SOMETHING I DO BELIEVE SHE SAYS THAT IT IS THIS NURSERY I DO BELIEVE IT IS SAYS JANE GO ON
1040-133433-0048 THEY ARE NOW EMBARKED ON THE GREAT ADVENTURE OF THE NIGHT WHEN PETER FLEW IN LOOKING FOR HIS SHADOW
1040-133433-0049 YOU HAVE MISSED A BIT INTERRUPTS JANE WHO NOW KNOWS THE STORY BETTER THAN HER MOTHER WHEN YOU SAW HIM SITTING ON THE FLOOR CRYING WHAT DID YOU SAY I SAT UP IN BED AND I SAID BOY WHY ARE YOU CRYING
1040-133433-0050 YES THAT WAS IT SAYS JANE WITH A BIG BREATH AND THEN HE FLEW US ALL AWAY TO THE NEVERLAND AND THE FAIRIES AND THE PIRATES AND THE REDSKINS AND THE MERMAID'S LAGOON
1040-133433-0051 YES WHICH DID YOU LIKE BEST OF ALL I THINK I LIKED THE HOME UNDER THE GROUND BEST OF ALL
1040-133433-0052 WHAT WAS THE LAST THING PETER EVER SAID TO YOU THE LAST THING HE EVER SAID TO ME WAS JUST ALWAYS BE WAITING FOR ME AND THEN SOME NIGHT YOU WILL HEAR ME CROWING YES BUT ALAS HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME
1040-133433-0053 WENDY SAID IT WITH A SMILE SHE WAS AS GROWN UP AS THAT WHAT DID HIS CROW SOUND LIKE JANE ASKED ONE EVENING IT WAS LIKE THIS WENDY SAID
1040-133433-0054 TRYING TO IMITATE PETER'S CROW NO IT WASN'T JANE SAID GRAVELY
1040-133433-0055 JANE SAID AH YES MANY GIRLS HEAR IT WHEN THEY ARE SLEEPING BUT I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO HEARD IT AWAKE LUCKY YOU SAID JANE AND THEN ONE NIGHT CAME THE TRAGEDY IT WAS THE SPRING OF THE YEAR
1040-133433-0056 WENDY WAS SITTING ON THE FLOOR VERY CLOSE TO THE FIRE SO AS TO SEE TO DARN FOR THERE WAS NO OTHER LIGHT IN THE NURSERY AND WHILE SHE SAT DARNING SHE HEARD A CROW THEN THE WINDOW BLEW OPEN AS OF OLD
1040-133433-0057 HE WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS EVER AND WENDY SAW AT ONCE THAT HE STILL HAD ALL HIS FIRST TEETH HE WAS A LITTLE BOY AND SHE WAS GROWN UP SHE HUDDLED BY THE FIRE NOT DARING TO MOVE HELPLESS AND GUILTY
1040-133433-0058 A BIG WOMAN HULLO WENDY HE SAID NOT NOTICING ANY DIFFERENCE FOR HE WAS THINKING CHIEFLY OF HIMSELF AND IN THE DIM LIGHT HER WHITE DRESS MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE NIGHTGOWN IN WHICH HE HAD SEEN HER FIRST HULLO PETER
1040-133433-0059 SHE REPLIED FAINTLY SQUEEZING HERSELF AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE SOMETHING INSIDE HER WAS CRYING WOMAN WOMAN LET GO OF ME HULLO WHERE IS JOHN HE ASKED SUDDENLY MISSING THE THIRD BED
1040-133433-0060 JOHN IS NOT HERE NOW SHE GASPED IS MICHAEL ASLEEP HE ASKED WITH A CARELESS GLANCE AT JANE
1040-133433-0061 THAT IS NOT MICHAEL SHE SAID QUICKLY LEST A JUDGMENT SHOULD FALL ON HER PETER LOOKED HULLO IS IT A NEW ONE YES BOY OR GIRL GIRL NOW SURELY HE WOULD UNDERSTAND BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1040-133433-0062 PETER SHE SAID FALTERING ARE YOU EXPECTING ME TO FLY AWAY WITH YOU OF COURSE THAT IS WHY I HAVE COME HE ADDED A LITTLE STERNLY HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THAT THIS IS SPRING CLEANING TIME
1040-133433-0063 SHE KNEW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY THAT HE HAD LET MANY SPRING CLEANING TIMES PASS I CAN'T COME SHE SAID APOLOGETICALLY I HAVE FORGOTTEN HOW TO FLY I'LL SOON TEACH YOU AGAIN O PETER DON'T WASTE THE FAIRY DUST ON ME
1040-133433-0064 WHAT IS IT HE CRIED SHRINKING
1040-133433-0065 FOR ALMOST THE ONLY TIME IN HIS LIFE THAT I KNOW OF PETER WAS AFRAID DON'T TURN UP THE LIGHT HE CRIED SHE LET HER HANDS PLAY IN THE HAIR OF THE TRAGIC BOY SHE WAS NOT A LITTLE GIRL HEART BROKEN ABOUT HIM
1040-133433-0066 SHE WAS A GROWN WOMAN SMILING AT IT ALL
1040-133433-0067 THEN SHE TURNED UP THE LIGHT AND PETER SAW HE GAVE A CRY OF PAIN AND WHEN THE TALL BEAUTIFUL CREATURE STOOPED TO LIFT HIM IN HER ARMS HE DREW BACK SHARPLY WHAT IS IT HE CRIED AGAIN SHE HAD TO TELL HIM
1040-133433-0068 I AM OLD PETER I AM EVER SO MUCH MORE THAN TWENTY I GREW UP LONG AGO YOU PROMISED NOT TO I COULDN'T HELP IT
1040-133433-0069 NO YOU'RE NOT YES AND THE LITTLE GIRL IN THE BED IS MY BABY NO SHE'S NOT
1040-133433-0070 OF COURSE HE DID NOT STRIKE
1040-133433-0071 AND WENDY DID NOT KNOW HOW TO COMFORT HIM THOUGH SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT SO EASILY ONCE SHE WAS ONLY A WOMAN NOW AND SHE RAN OUT OF THE ROOM TO TRY TO THINK PETER CONTINUED TO CRY AND SOON HIS SOBS WOKE JANE
1040-133433-0072 BOY SHE SAID WHY ARE YOU CRYING PETER ROSE AND BOWED TO HER AND SHE BOWED TO HIM FROM THE BED HULLO HE SAID HULLO SAID JANE MY NAME IS PETER PAN HE TOLD HER
1040-133433-0073 YES I KNOW I CAME BACK FOR MY MOTHER HE EXPLAINED TO TAKE HER TO THE NEVERLAND YES I KNOW JANE SAID I HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU WHEN WENDY RETURNED DIFFIDENTLY SHE FOUND PETER SITTING ON THE BED POST CROWING GLORIOUSLY
1040-133433-0074 WHILE JANE IN HER NIGHTY WAS FLYING ROUND THE ROOM IN SOLEMN ECSTASY SHE IS MY MOTHER PETER EXPLAINED AND JANE DESCENDED AND STOOD BY HIS SIDE WITH THE LOOK IN HER FACE THAT HE LIKED TO SEE ON LADIES WHEN THEY GAZED AT HIM
1040-133433-0075 HE DOES SO NEED A MOTHER JANE SAID YES I KNOW WENDY ADMITTED RATHER FORLORNLY NO ONE KNOWS IT SO WELL AS I GOOD BYE SAID PETER TO WENDY AND HE ROSE IN THE AIR AND THE SHAMELESS JANE ROSE WITH HIM
1040-133433-0076 IT WAS ALREADY HER EASIEST WAY OF MOVING ABOUT WENDY RUSHED TO THE WINDOW NO NO SHE CRIED IT IS JUST FOR SPRING CLEANING TIME JANE SAID HE WANTS ME ALWAYS TO DO HIS SPRING CLEANING
1040-133433-0077 IF ONLY I COULD GO WITH YOU WENDY SIGHED YOU SEE YOU CAN'T FLY SAID JANE OF COURSE IN THE END WENDY LET THEM FLY AWAY TOGETHER
1040-133433-0078 OUR LAST GLIMPSE OF HER SHOWS HER AT THE WINDOW
1040-133433-0079 AS YOU LOOK AT WENDY YOU MAY SEE HER HAIR BECOMING WHITE AND HER FIGURE LITTLE AGAIN FOR ALL THIS HAPPENED LONG AGO
1040-133433-0080 AND EVERY SPRING CLEANING TIME EXCEPT WHEN HE FORGETS PETER COMES FOR MARGARET AND TAKES HER TO THE NEVERLAND WHERE SHE TELLS HIM STORIES ABOUT HIMSELF TO WHICH HE LISTENS EAGERLY WHEN MARGARET GROWS UP SHE WILL HAVE A DAUGHTER WHO IS TO BE PETER'S MOTHER IN TURN
1069-133699-0000 HE TOOK A RESOLVE AFTER THIS NOT TO MISINTERPRET HER WORDS EVEN WHEN MISS STACKPOLE APPEARED TO STRIKE THE PERSONAL NOTE MOST STRONGLY HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF THAT PERSONS IN HER VIEW WERE SIMPLE AND HOMOGENEOUS ORGANISMS
1069-133699-0001 TO DEAL WITH HER IN STRICT RECIPROCITY HE CARRIED OUT HIS RESOLVE WITH A GREAT DEAL OF TACT AND THE YOUNG LADY FOUND IN RENEWED CONTACT WITH HIM NO OBSTACLE TO THE EXERCISE OF HER GENIUS FOR UNSHRINKING ENQUIRY
1069-133699-0002 THE GENERAL APPLICATION OF HER CONFIDENCE HER SITUATION AT GARDENCOURT THEREFORE APPRECIATED AS WE HAVE SEEN HER TO BE BY ISABEL AND FULL OF APPRECIATION HERSELF OF THAT FREE PLAY OF INTELLIGENCE
1069-133699-0003 SHE PRESENTLY DISCOVERED IN TRUTH THAT THIS OBLIGATION WAS OF THE LIGHTEST AND THAT MISSUS TOUCHETT CARED VERY LITTLE HOW MISS STACKPOLE BEHAVED MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD DEFINED HER TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0004 AS BOTH AN ADVENTURESS AND A BORE ADVENTURESSES USUALLY GIVING ONE MORE OF A THRILL SHE HAD EXPRESSED SOME SURPRISE AT HER NIECE'S HAVING SELECTED SUCH A FRIEND
1069-133699-0005 YET HAD IMMEDIATELY ADDED THAT SHE KNEW ISABEL'S FRIENDS WERE HER OWN AFFAIR AND THAT SHE HAD NEVER UNDERTAKEN TO LIKE THEM ALL OR TO RESTRICT THE GIRL TO THOSE SHE LIKED
1069-133699-0006 MY DEAR YOU'D HAVE A VERY SMALL SOCIETY MISSUS TOUCHETT FRANKLY ADMITTED AND I DON'T THINK I LIKE ANY MAN OR WOMAN WELL ENOUGH TO RECOMMEND THEM TO YOU WHEN IT COMES TO RECOMMENDING IT'S A SERIOUS AFFAIR
1069-133699-0007 I DON'T LIKE MISS STACKPOLE EVERYTHING ABOUT HER DISPLEASES ME SHE TALKS SO MUCH TOO LOUD AND LOOKS AT ONE AS IF ONE WANTED TO LOOK AT HER WHICH ONE DOESN'T
1069-133699-0008 I'M SURE SHE HAS LIVED ALL HER LIFE IN A BOARDING HOUSE AND I DETEST THE MANNERS AND THE LIBERTIES OF SUCH PLACES IF YOU ASK ME IF I PREFER MY OWN MANNERS WHICH YOU DOUBTLESS THINK VERY BAD I'LL TELL YOU THAT I PREFER THEM IMMENSELY
1069-133699-0009 AND SHE DETESTS ME FOR DETESTING IT
1069-133699-0010 MISSUS TOUCHETT WAS RIGHT IN GUESSING THAT HENRIETTA DISAPPROVED OF HER BUT SHE HAD NOT QUITE PUT HER FINGER ON THE REASON A DAY OR TWO AFTER MISS STACKPOLE'S ARRIVAL
1069-133699-0011 WHICH EXCITED A VEIN OF COUNTER ARGUMENT ON THE PART OF THE CORRESPONDENT OF THE INTERVIEWER WHO IN THE EXERCISE OF HER PROFESSION HAD ACQUAINTED HERSELF IN THE WESTERN WORLD WITH EVERY FORM OF CARAVANSARY
1069-133699-0012 RALPH WITH HIS EXPERIMENTAL GENIALITY SUGGESTED BY WAY OF HEALING THE BREACH THAT THE TRUTH LAY BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES AND THAT THE ESTABLISHMENTS IN QUESTION OUGHT TO BE DESCRIBED AS FAIR MIDDLING
1069-133699-0013 THIS CONTRIBUTION TO THE DISCUSSION HOWEVER MISS STACKPOLE REJECTED WITH SCORN MIDDLING INDEED IF THEY WERE NOT THE BEST IN THE WORLD THEY WERE THE WORST BUT THERE WAS NOTHING MIDDLING ABOUT AN AMERICAN HOTEL
1069-133699-0014 I LIKE TO BE TREATED AS AN AMERICAN LADY POOR AMERICAN LADIES CRIED MISSUS TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH THEY'RE THE SLAVES OF SLAVES THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN HENRIETTA RETORTED
1069-133699-0015 THEY'RE THE COMPANIONS OF THEIR SERVANTS THE IRISH CHAMBERMAID AND THE NEGRO WAITER THEY SHARE THEIR WORK DO YOU CALL THE DOMESTICS IN AN AMERICAN HOUSEHOLD SLAVES MISS STACKPOLE ENQUIRED
1069-133699-0016 IF THAT'S THE WAY YOU DESIRE TO TREAT THEM NO WONDER YOU DON'T LIKE AMERICA IF YOU'VE NOT GOOD SERVANTS YOU'RE MISERABLE MISSUS TOUCHETT SERENELY SAID THEY'RE VERY BAD IN AMERICA BUT I'VE FIVE PERFECT ONES IN FLORENCE
1069-133699-0017 I DON'T SEE WHAT YOU WANT WITH FIVE HENRIETTA COULDN'T HELP OBSERVING I DON'T THINK I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE FIVE PERSONS SURROUNDING ME IN THAT MENIAL POSITION
1069-133699-0018 SHOULD YOU LIKE ME BETTER IF I WERE YOUR BUTLER DEAR HER HUSBAND ASKED I DON'T THINK I SHOULD YOU WOULDN'T AT ALL HAVE THE TENUE THE COMPANIONS OF FREEMEN I LIKE THAT MISS STACKPOLE SAID RALPH
1069-133699-0019 IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DESCRIPTION WHEN I SAID FREEMEN I DIDN'T MEAN YOU SIR AND THIS WAS THE ONLY REWARD THAT RALPH GOT FOR HIS COMPLIMENT MISS STACKPOLE WAS BAFFLED
1069-133699-0020 WHICH SHE PRIVATELY JUDGED TO BE A MYSTERIOUS SURVIVAL OF FEUDALISM IT WAS PERHAPS BECAUSE HER MIND WAS OPPRESSED WITH THIS IMAGE THAT SHE SUFFERED SOME DAYS TO ELAPSE BEFORE SHE TOOK OCCASION TO SAY TO ISABEL
1069-133699-0021 MY DEAR FRIEND I WONDER IF YOU'RE GROWING FAITHLESS FAITHLESS FAITHLESS TO YOU HENRIETTA NO THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PAIN BUT IT'S NOT THAT FAITHLESS TO MY COUNTRY THEN
1069-133699-0022 THAT I HOPE WILL NEVER BE WHEN I WROTE TO YOU FROM LIVERPOOL I SAID I HAD SOMETHING PARTICULAR TO TELL YOU YOU'VE NEVER ASKED ME WHAT IT IS IS IT BECAUSE YOU'VE SUSPECTED SUSPECTED WHAT
1069-133699-0023 YOU DON'T ASK THAT RIGHT AS IF YOU THOUGHT IT IMPORTANT YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'RE THINKING OF OTHER THINGS TELL ME WHAT YOU MEAN AND I'LL THINK OF THAT WILL YOU REALLY THINK OF IT THAT'S WHAT I WISH TO BE SURE OF
1069-133699-0024 I'VE NOT MUCH CONTROL OF MY THOUGHTS BUT I'LL DO MY BEST SAID ISABEL HENRIETTA GAZED AT HER IN SILENCE FOR A PERIOD WHICH TRIED ISABEL'S PATIENCE SO THAT OUR HEROINE ADDED AT LAST
1069-133699-0025 ISABEL RESPONDED YOU SAY THAT RIGHT I HAD A GOOD DEAL OF TALK WITH HIM HE HAS COME AFTER YOU DID HE TELL YOU SO NO HE TOLD ME NOTHING THAT'S HOW I KNEW IT SAID HENRIETTA CLEVERLY
1069-133699-0026 HE SAID VERY LITTLE ABOUT YOU BUT I SPOKE OF YOU A GOOD DEAL ISABEL WAITED AT THE MENTION OF MISTER GOODWOOD'S NAME SHE HAD TURNED A LITTLE PALE I'M VERY SORRY YOU DID THAT SHE OBSERVED AT LAST
1069-133699-0027 I COULD HAVE TALKED A LONG TIME TO SUCH A LISTENER HE WAS SO QUIET SO INTENSE HE DRANK IT ALL IN WHAT DID YOU SAY ABOUT ME ISABEL ASKED I SAID YOU WERE ON THE WHOLE THE FINEST CREATURE I KNOW
1069-133699-0028 WHILE I TALKED I NEVER SAW AN UGLY MAN LOOK SO HANDSOME HE'S VERY SIMPLE MINDED SAID ISABEL AND HE'S NOT SO UGLY THERE'S NOTHING SO SIMPLIFYING AS A GRAND PASSION
1069-133699-0029 IT'S NOT A GRAND PASSION I'M VERY SURE IT'S NOT THAT YOU DON'T SAY THAT AS IF YOU WERE SURE ISABEL GAVE RATHER A COLD SMILE I SHALL SAY IT BETTER TO MISTER GOODWOOD HIMSELF
1069-133699-0030 ISABEL OFFERED NO ANSWER TO THIS ASSERTION WHICH HER COMPANION MADE WITH AN AIR OF GREAT CONFIDENCE HE'LL FIND YOU CHANGED THE LATTER PURSUED YOU'VE BEEN AFFECTED BY YOUR NEW SURROUNDINGS VERY LIKELY I'M AFFECTED BY EVERYTHING
1069-133699-0031 BY EVERYTHING BUT MISTER GOODWOOD MISS STACKPOLE EXCLAIMED WITH A SLIGHTLY HARSH HILARITY ISABEL FAILED EVEN TO SMILE BACK AND IN A MOMENT SHE SAID DID HE ASK YOU TO SPEAK TO ME NOT IN SO MANY WORDS
1069-133699-0032 BUT HIS EYES ASKED IT AND HIS HANDSHAKE WHEN HE BADE ME GOOD BYE THANK YOU FOR DOING SO AND ISABEL TURNED AWAY YES YOU'RE CHANGED YOU'VE GOT NEW IDEAS OVER HERE HER FRIEND CONTINUED I HOPE SO SAID ISABEL
1069-133699-0033 ONE SHOULD GET AS MANY NEW IDEAS AS POSSIBLE YES BUT THEY SHOULDN'T INTERFERE WITH THE OLD ONES WHEN THE OLD ONES HAVE BEEN THE RIGHT ONES ISABEL TURNED ABOUT AGAIN IF YOU MEAN THAT I HAD ANY IDEA WITH REGARD TO MISTER GOODWOOD
1069-133699-0034 BUT SHE FALTERED BEFORE HER FRIEND'S IMPLACABLE GLITTER MY DEAR CHILD YOU CERTAINLY ENCOURAGED HIM ISABEL MADE FOR THE MOMENT AS IF TO DENY THIS CHARGE INSTEAD OF WHICH HOWEVER SHE PRESENTLY ANSWERED
1069-133699-0035 IT'S VERY TRUE I DID ENCOURAGE HIM AND THEN SHE ASKED IF HER COMPANION HAD LEARNED FROM MISTER GOODWOOD WHAT HE INTENDED TO DO IT WAS A CONCESSION TO HER CURIOSITY FOR SHE DISLIKED DISCUSSING THE SUBJECT
1069-133699-0036 AND FOUND HENRIETTA WANTING IN DELICACY I ASKED HIM AND HE SAID HE MEANT TO DO NOTHING MISS STACKPOLE ANSWERED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S NOT A MAN TO DO NOTHING HE IS A MAN OF HIGH BOLD ACTION
1069-133699-0037 AND WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT I QUITE BELIEVE THAT HENRIETTA MIGHT BE WANTING IN DELICACY BUT IT TOUCHED THE GIRL ALL THE SAME TO HEAR THIS DECLARATION AH YOU DO CARE FOR HIM HER VISITOR RANG OUT
1069-133699-0038 WHATEVER HE DOES WILL ALWAYS BE RIGHT ISABEL REPEATED WHEN A MAN'S OF THAT INFALLIBLE MOULD WHAT DOES IT MATTER TO HIM WHAT ONE FEELS IT MAY NOT MATTER TO HIM BUT IT MATTERS TO ONE'S SELF AH
1069-133699-0039 I HOPE HE'LL HATE ME THEN SAID ISABEL I BELIEVE YOU HOPE IT ABOUT AS MUCH AS I BELIEVE HIM CAPABLE OF IT TO THIS OBSERVATION OUR HEROINE MADE NO RETURN
1069-133699-0040 SHE WAS ABSORBED IN THE ALARM GIVEN HER BY HENRIETTA'S INTIMATION THAT CASPAR GOODWOOD WOULD PRESENT HIMSELF AT GARDENCOURT SHE PRETENDED TO HERSELF HOWEVER THAT SHE THOUGHT THE EVENT IMPOSSIBLE AND LATER
1069-133699-0041 SHE COMMUNICATED HER DISBELIEF TO HER FRIEND FOR THE NEXT FORTY EIGHT HOURS NEVERTHELESS SHE STOOD PREPARED TO HEAR THE YOUNG MAN'S NAME ANNOUNCED THE FEELING PRESSED UPON HER IT MADE THE AIR SULTRY
1069-133699-0042 AND AFTER STROLLING ABOUT FOR SOME TIME IN A MANNER AT ONCE LISTLESS AND RESTLESS HAD SEATED HERSELF ON A GARDEN BENCH WITHIN SIGHT OF THE HOUSE BENEATH A SPREADING BEECH WHERE IN A WHITE DRESS ORNAMENTED WITH BLACK RIBBONS
1069-133699-0043 SHE FORMED AMONG THE FLICKERING SHADOWS A GRACEFUL AND HARMONIOUS IMAGE
1069-133699-0044 AS TO WHOM THE PROPOSAL OF AN OWNERSHIP DIVIDED WITH HER COUSIN HAD BEEN APPLIED AS IMPARTIALLY AS POSSIBLE AS IMPARTIALLY AS BUNCHIE'S OWN SOMEWHAT FICKLE AND INCONSTANT SYMPATHIES WOULD ALLOW
1069-133699-0045 BUT SHE WAS NOTIFIED FOR THE FIRST TIME ON THIS OCCASION OF THE FINITE CHARACTER OF BUNCHIE'S INTELLECT HITHERTO SHE HAD BEEN MAINLY STRUCK WITH ITS EXTENT
1069-133699-0046 IT SEEMED TO HER AT LAST THAT SHE WOULD DO WELL TO TAKE A BOOK FORMERLY WHEN HEAVY HEARTED SHE HAD BEEN ABLE WITH THE HELP OF SOME WELL CHOSEN VOLUME TO TRANSFER THE SEAT OF CONSCIOUSNESS TO THE ORGAN OF PURE REASON
1069-133699-0047 OF LATE IT WAS NOT TO BE DENIED LITERATURE HAD SEEMED A FADING LIGHT AND EVEN AFTER SHE HAD REMINDED HERSELF THAT HER UNCLE'S LIBRARY WAS PROVIDED WITH A COMPLETE SET OF THOSE AUTHORS WHICH NO GENTLEMAN'S COLLECTION SHOULD BE WITHOUT
1069-133699-0048 SHE SAT MOTIONLESS AND EMPTY HANDED HER EYES BENT ON THE COOL GREEN TURF OF THE LAWN HER MEDITATIONS WERE PRESENTLY INTERRUPTED BY THE ARRIVAL OF A SERVANT WHO HANDED HER A LETTER THE LETTER BORE THE LONDON POSTMARK
1069-133699-0049 YOU WILL REMEMBER THAT WHEN YOU GAVE ME MY DISMISSAL AT ALBANY THREE MONTHS AGO I DID NOT ACCEPT IT I PROTESTED AGAINST IT YOU IN FACT APPEARED TO ACCEPT MY PROTEST AND TO ADMIT THAT I HAD THE RIGHT ON MY SIDE
1069-133699-0050 I HAD COME TO SEE YOU WITH THE HOPE THAT YOU WOULD LET ME BRING YOU OVER TO MY CONVICTION MY REASONS FOR ENTERTAINING THIS HOPE HAD BEEN OF THE BEST BUT YOU DISAPPOINTED IT I FOUND YOU CHANGED
1069-133699-0051 ARBITRARY OR CAPRICIOUS THEREFORE IT IS THAT I BELIEVE YOU WILL LET ME SEE YOU AGAIN YOU TOLD ME THAT I'M NOT DISAGREEABLE TO YOU AND I BELIEVE IT FOR I DON'T SEE WHY THAT SHOULD BE I SHALL ALWAYS THINK OF YOU
1069-133699-0052 I SHALL NEVER THINK OF ANY ONE ELSE I CAME TO ENGLAND SIMPLY BECAUSE YOU ARE HERE I COULDN'T STAY AT HOME AFTER YOU HAD GONE I HATED THE COUNTRY BECAUSE YOU WERE NOT IN IT IF I LIKE THIS COUNTRY AT PRESENT
1069-133699-0053 IT IS ONLY BECAUSE IT HOLDS YOU I HAVE BEEN TO ENGLAND BEFORE BUT HAVE NEVER ENJOYED IT MUCH MAY I NOT COME AND SEE YOU FOR HALF AN HOUR THIS AT PRESENT IS THE DEAREST WISH OF YOURS FAITHFULLY
1069-133699-0054 CASPAR GOODWOOD ISABEL READ THIS MISSIVE WITH SUCH DEEP ATTENTION THAT SHE HAD NOT PERCEIVED AN APPROACHING TREAD ON THE SOFT GRASS
1069-133709-0000 HAD LAID BEFORE HER A PAIR OF ALTERNATIVES NOW OF COURSE YOU'RE COMPLETELY YOUR OWN MISTRESS AND ARE AS FREE AS THE BIRD ON THE BOUGH I DON'T MEAN YOU WERE NOT SO BEFORE BUT YOU'RE AT PRESENT ON A DIFFERENT FOOTING
1069-133709-0001 PROPERTY ERECTS A KIND OF BARRIER YOU CAN DO A GREAT MANY THINGS IF YOU'RE RICH WHICH WOULD BE SEVERELY CRITICISED IF YOU WERE POOR YOU CAN GO AND COME YOU CAN TRAVEL ALONE YOU CAN HAVE YOUR OWN ESTABLISHMENT
1069-133709-0002 I MEAN OF COURSE IF YOU'LL TAKE A COMPANION SOME DECAYED GENTLEWOMAN WITH A DARNED CASHMERE AND DYED HAIR WHO PAINTS ON VELVET YOU DON'T THINK YOU'D LIKE THAT OF COURSE YOU CAN DO AS YOU PLEASE
1069-133709-0003 SHE'D KEEP PEOPLE OFF VERY WELL I THINK
1069-133709-0004 THAT IT'S A GREAT DEAL BETTER YOU SHOULD REMAIN WITH ME IN SPITE OF THERE BEING NO OBLIGATION IT'S BETTER FOR SEVERAL REASONS QUITE APART FROM YOUR LIKING IT I SHOULDN'T THINK YOU'D LIKE IT BUT I RECOMMEND YOU TO MAKE THE SACRIFICE
1069-133709-0005 SHE HAD A GREAT REGARD FOR WHAT WAS USUALLY DEEMED DECENT AND A YOUNG GENTLEWOMAN WITHOUT VISIBLE RELATIONS HAD ALWAYS STRUCK HER AS A FLOWER WITHOUT FOLIAGE
1069-133709-0006 WHEN SHE SAT IN HER DAMP WATERPROOF AND SKETCHED THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT EUROPE WOULD OFFER TO A YOUNG PERSON OF TASTE THIS HOWEVER WAS IN A GREAT MEASURE THE GIRL'S OWN FAULT SHE HAD GOT A GLIMPSE OF HER AUNT'S EXPERIENCE
1069-133709-0007 AND HER IMAGINATION CONSTANTLY ANTICIPATED THE JUDGEMENTS AND EMOTIONS OF A WOMAN WHO HAD VERY LITTLE OF THE SAME FACULTY APART FROM THIS MISSUS TOUCHETT HAD A GREAT MERIT SHE WAS AS HONEST AS A PAIR OF COMPASSES
1069-133709-0008 BUT WAS NEVER OVER INQUISITIVE AS REGARDS THE TERRITORY OF HER NEIGHBOUR ISABEL CAME AT LAST TO HAVE A KIND OF UNDEMONSTRABLE PITY FOR HER THERE SEEMED SOMETHING SO DREARY IN THE CONDITION OF A PERSON WHOSE NATURE HAD AS IT WERE
1069-133709-0009 SO LITTLE SURFACE OFFERED SO LIMITED A FACE TO THE ACCRETIONS OF HUMAN CONTACT NOTHING TENDER NOTHING SYMPATHETIC HAD EVER HAD A CHANCE TO FASTEN UPON IT
1069-133709-0010 NO WIND SOWN BLOSSOM NO FAMILIAR SOFTENING MOSS HER OFFERED HER PASSIVE EXTENT IN OTHER WORDS WAS ABOUT THAT OF A KNIFE EDGE ISABEL HAD REASON TO BELIEVE NONE THE LESS
1069-133709-0011 SHE WAS LEARNING TO SACRIFICE CONSISTENCY TO CONSIDERATIONS OF THAT INFERIOR ORDER FOR WHICH THE EXCUSE MUST BE FOUND IN THE PARTICULAR CASE IT WAS NOT TO THE CREDIT OF HER ABSOLUTE RECTITUDE
1069-133709-0012 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE GONE THE LONGEST WAY ROUND TO FLORENCE IN ORDER TO SPEND A FEW WEEKS WITH HER INVALID SON
1069-133709-0013 THAT WHEN RALPH WISHED TO SEE HER HE WAS AT LIBERTY TO REMEMBER THAT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI CONTAINED A LARGE APARTMENT KNOWN AS THE QUARTER OF THE SIGNORINO I WANT TO ASK YOU SOMETHING
1069-133709-0014 ISABEL SAID TO THIS YOUNG MAN THE DAY AFTER HER ARRIVAL AT SAN REMO SOMETHING I'VE THOUGHT MORE THAN ONCE OF ASKING YOU BY LETTER BUT THAT I'VE HESITATED ON THE WHOLE TO WRITE ABOUT FACE TO FACE NEVERTHELESS
1069-133709-0015 WHAT DOES IT MATTER MY DEAR ISABEL WHETHER I KNEW MY FATHER WAS VERY OBSTINATE SO SAID THE GIRL YOU DID KNOW YES HE TOLD ME WE EVEN TALKED IT OVER A LITTLE
1069-133709-0016 ASKED ISABEL ABRUPTLY WHY AS A KIND OF COMPLIMENT A COMPLIMENT ON WHAT ON YOUR SO BEAUTIFULLY EXISTING HE LIKED ME TOO MUCH SHE PRESENTLY DECLARED THAT'S A WAY WE ALL HAVE
1069-133709-0017 IF I BELIEVED THAT I SHOULD BE VERY UNHAPPY FORTUNATELY I DON'T BELIEVE IT I WANT TO BE TREATED WITH JUSTICE I WANT NOTHING BUT THAT VERY GOOD BUT YOU MUST REMEMBER THAT JUSTICE TO A LOVELY BEING
1069-133709-0018 IS AFTER ALL A FLORID SORT OF SENTIMENT I'M NOT A LOVELY BEING HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN I'M ASKING SUCH ODIOUS QUESTIONS I MUST SEEM TO YOU DELICATE
1069-133709-0019 YOU SEEM TO ME TROUBLED SAID RALPH I AM TROUBLED ABOUT WHAT FOR A MOMENT SHE ANSWERED NOTHING THEN SHE BROKE OUT DO YOU THINK IT GOOD FOR ME SUDDENLY TO BE MADE SO RICH
1069-133709-0020 HENRIETTA DOESN'T OH HANG HENRIETTA SAID RALPH COARSELY IF YOU ASK ME I'M DELIGHTED AT IT IS THAT WHY YOUR FATHER DID IT FOR YOUR AMUSEMENT I DIFFER WITH MISS STACKPOLE
1069-133709-0021 RALPH WENT ON MORE GRAVELY I THINK IT VERY GOOD FOR YOU TO HAVE MEANS ISABEL LOOKED AT HIM WITH SERIOUS EYES I WONDER WHETHER YOU KNOW WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME OR WHETHER YOU CARE IF I KNOW DEPEND UPON IT I CARE
1069-133709-0022 DON'T QUESTION YOUR CONSCIENCE SO MUCH IT WILL GET OUT OF TUNE LIKE A STRUMMED PIANO KEEP IT FOR GREAT OCCASIONS DON'T TRY SO MUCH TO FORM YOUR CHARACTER IT'S LIKE TRYING TO PULL OPEN A TIGHT TENDER YOUNG ROSE
1069-133709-0023 LIVE AS YOU LIKE BEST AND YOUR CHARACTER WILL TAKE CARE OF ITSELF MOST THINGS ARE GOOD FOR YOU THE EXCEPTIONS ARE VERY RARE AND A COMFORTABLE INCOME'S NOT ONE OF THEM RALPH PAUSED SMILING
1069-133709-0024 ISABEL HAD LISTENED QUICKLY YOU'VE TOO MUCH POWER OF THOUGHT ABOVE ALL TOO MUCH CONSCIENCE RALPH ADDED IT'S OUT OF ALL REASON THE NUMBER OF THINGS YOU THINK WRONG PUT BACK YOUR WATCH DIET YOUR FEVER
1069-133709-0025 IT'S NEVER WRONG TO DO THAT SHE HAD LISTENED EAGERLY AS I SAY AND IT WAS HER NATURE TO UNDERSTAND QUICKLY I WONDER IF YOU APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAY IF YOU DO YOU TAKE A GREAT RESPONSIBILITY YOU FRIGHTEN ME A LITTLE
1069-133709-0026 BUT I THINK I'M RIGHT SAID RALPH PERSISTING IN CHEER ALL THE SAME WHAT YOU SAY IS VERY TRUE ISABEL PURSUED YOU COULD SAY NOTHING MORE TRUE I'M ABSORBED IN MYSELF I LOOK AT LIFE TOO MUCH AS A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION
1069-133709-0027 WHY INDEED SHOULD WE PERPETUALLY BE THINKING WHETHER THINGS ARE GOOD FOR US AS IF WE WERE PATIENTS LYING IN A HOSPITAL WHY SHOULD I BE SO AFRAID OF NOT DOING RIGHT AS IF IT MATTERED TO THE WORLD WHETHER I DO RIGHT OR WRONG
1069-133709-0028 YOU'RE A CAPITAL PERSON TO ADVISE SAID RALPH YOU TAKE THE WIND OUT OF MY SAILS SHE LOOKED AT HIM AS IF SHE HAD NOT HEARD HIM THOUGH SHE WAS FOLLOWING OUT THE TRAIN OF REFLEXION WHICH HE HIMSELF HAD KINDLED
1069-133709-0029 A LARGE FORTUNE MEANS FREEDOM AND I'M AFRAID OF THAT IT'S SUCH A FINE THING AND ONE SHOULD MAKE SUCH A GOOD USE OF IT IF ONE SHOULDN'T ONE WOULD BE ASHAMED AND ONE MUST KEEP THINKING IT'S A CONSTANT EFFORT
1069-133709-0030 I'M NOT SURE IT'S NOT A GREATER HAPPINESS TO BE POWERLESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE I'VE NO DOUBT IT'S A GREATER HAPPINESS FOR WEAK PEOPLE THE EFFORT NOT TO BE CONTEMPTIBLE MUST BE GREAT AND HOW DO YOU KNOW I'M NOT WEAK ISABEL ASKED
1069-133709-0031 THE GATE OF ADMIRATIONS ITALY AS YET IMPERFECTLY SEEN AND FELT STRETCHED BEFORE HER AS A LAND OF PROMISE A LAND IN WHICH A LOVE OF THE BEAUTIFUL MIGHT BE COMFORTED BY ENDLESS KNOWLEDGE
1069-133709-0032 WHENEVER SHE STROLLED UPON THE SHORE WITH HER COUSIN AND SHE WAS THE COMPANION OF HIS DAILY WALK SHE LOOKED ACROSS THE SEA WITH LONGING EYES TO WHERE SHE KNEW THAT GENOA LAY
1069-133709-0033 SHE WAS GLAD TO PAUSE HOWEVER ON THE EDGE OF THIS LARGER ADVENTURE THERE WAS SUCH A THRILL EVEN IN THE PRELIMINARY HOVERING IT AFFECTED HER MOREOVER AS A PEACEFUL INTERLUDE AS A HUSH OF THE DRUM AND FIFE IN A CAREER WHICH SHE HAD LITTLE WARRANT
1069-133709-0034 AS YET FOR REGARDING AS AGITATED BUT WHICH NEVERTHELESS SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PICTURING TO HERSELF BY THE LIGHT OF HER HOPES HER FEARS HER FANCIES HER AMBITIONS HER PREDILECTIONS
1069-133709-0035 MADAME MERLE HAD PREDICTED TO MISSUS TOUCHETT THAT AFTER THEIR YOUNG FRIEND HAD PUT HER HAND INTO HER POCKET HALF A DOZEN TIMES SHE WOULD BE RECONCILED TO THE IDEA THAT IT HAD BEEN FILLED BY A MUNIFICENT UNCLE
1069-133709-0036 GROWN USED TO FEELING RICH THE CONSCIOUSNESS IN QUESTION FOUND A PROPER PLACE IN RATHER A DENSE LITTLE GROUP OF IDEAS THAT SHE HAD ABOUT HERSELF AND OFTEN IT WAS BY NO MEANS THE LEAST AGREEABLE
1069-133709-0037 IT TOOK PERPETUALLY FOR GRANTED A THOUSAND GOOD INTENTIONS SHE LOST HERSELF IN A MAZE OF VISIONS THE FINE THINGS TO BE DONE BY A RICH INDEPENDENT GENEROUS GIRL WHO TOOK A LARGE HUMAN VIEW OF OCCASIONS AND OBLIGATIONS
1069-133709-0038 WERE SUBLIME IN THE MASS HER FORTUNE THEREFORE BECAME TO HER MIND A PART OF HER BETTER SELF IT GAVE HER IMPORTANCE GAVE HER EVEN TO HER OWN IMAGINATION A CERTAIN IDEAL BEAUTY
1069-133709-0039 WHICH IN SPITE OF INCREASING DISTANCE WERE STILL SUFFICIENTLY SALIENT THEY WERE RECOGNISABLE WITHOUT DIFFICULTY
1069-133709-0040 SHE COULD SUMMON BACK HER FAITH IN CASE OF NEED WITH AN EFFORT BUT THE EFFORT WAS OFTEN PAINFUL EVEN WHEN THE REALITY HAD BEEN PLEASANT THE PAST WAS APT TO LOOK DEAD AND ITS REVIVAL RATHER TO SHOW THE
1069-133709-0041 LIVID LIGHT OF A JUDGEMENT DAY THE GIRL MOREOVER WAS NOT PRONE TO TAKE FOR GRANTED THAT SHE HERSELF LIVED IN THE MIND OF OTHERS
1069-133709-0042 SHE WAS CAPABLE OF BEING WOUNDED BY THE DISCOVERY THAT SHE HAD BEEN FORGOTTEN BUT OF ALL LIBERTIES THE ONE SHE HERSELF FOUND SWEETEST WAS THE LIBERTY TO FORGET SHE HAD NOT GIVEN HER LAST SHILLING SENTIMENTALLY SPEAKING
1069-133709-0043 EITHER TO CASPAR GOODWOOD OR TO LORD WARBURTON AND YET COULDN'T BUT FEEL THEM APPRECIABLY IN DEBT TO HER SHE HAD OF COURSE REMINDED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS TO HEAR FROM MISTER GOODWOOD AGAIN BUT THIS WAS NOT TO BE FOR ANOTHER YEAR AND A HALF
1069-133709-0044 AND IN THAT TIME A GREAT MANY THINGS MIGHT HAPPEN SHE HAD INDEED FAILED TO SAY TO HERSELF THAT HER AMERICAN SUITOR MIGHT FIND SOME OTHER GIRL MORE COMFORTABLE TO WOO BECAUSE THOUGH IT WAS CERTAIN MANY OTHER GIRLS WOULD PROVE SO
1069-133709-0045 SHE HAD NOT THE SMALLEST BELIEF THAT THIS MERIT WOULD ATTRACT HIM BUT SHE REFLECTED THAT SHE HERSELF MIGHT KNOW THE HUMILIATION OF CHANGE MIGHT REALLY FOR THAT MATTER COME TO THE END OF THE THINGS THAT WERE NOT CASPAR
1069-133709-0046 A CLEAR AND QUIET HARBOUR ENCLOSED BY A BRAVE GRANITE BREAKWATER BUT THAT DAY COULD ONLY COME IN ITS ORDER AND SHE COULDN'T WAIT FOR IT WITH FOLDED HANDS THAT LORD WARBURTON SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHERISH HER IMAGE
1069-133709-0047 SEEMED TO HER MORE THAN A NOBLE HUMILITY OR AN ENLIGHTENED PRIDE OUGHT TO WISH TO RECKON WITH SHE HAD SO DEFINITELY UNDERTAKEN TO PRESERVE NO RECORD OF WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM THAT A CORRESPONDING EFFORT ON HIS OWN PART
1069-133709-0048 WOULD BE EMINENTLY JUST THIS WAS NOT AS IT MAY SEEM MERELY A THEORY TINGED WITH SARCASM ISABEL CANDIDLY BELIEVED THAT HIS LORDSHIP WOULD IN THE USUAL PHRASE GET OVER HIS DISAPPOINTMENT
1069-133709-0049 HE HAD BEEN DEEPLY AFFECTED THIS SHE BELIEVED AND SHE WAS STILL CAPABLE OF DERIVING PLEASURE FROM THE BELIEF BUT IT WAS ABSURD THAT A MAN BOTH SO INTELLIGENT AND SO HONOURABLY DEALT WITH
1069-133709-0050 SHOULD CULTIVATE A SCAR OUT OF PROPORTION TO ANY WOUND ENGLISHMEN LIKED MOREOVER TO BE COMFORTABLE SAID ISABEL AND THERE COULD BE LITTLE COMFORT FOR LORD WARBURTON IN THE LONG RUN IN BROODING OVER A SELF SUFFICIENT AMERICAN GIRL
1069-133709-0051 WHO HAD BEEN BUT A CASUAL ACQUAINTANCE SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHOULD SHE HEAR FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER THAT HE HAD MARRIED SOME YOUNG WOMAN OF HIS OWN COUNTRY WHO HAD DONE MORE TO DESERVE HIM
1069-133709-0052 SHE SHOULD RECEIVE THE NEWS WITHOUT A PANG EVEN OF SURPRISE IT WOULD HAVE PROVED THAT HE BELIEVED SHE WAS FIRM WHICH WAS WHAT SHE WISHED TO SEEM TO HIM
1081-125237-0000 BEFORE THE SITTINGS OF THE GREAT ASSEMBLY HAD COME TO AN END A YOUNG STATESMAN DESTINED TO PLAY THE LEADING PART IN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DUTCH REPUBLIC DURING TWO DECADES HAD ALREADY MADE HIS MARK
1081-125237-0001 HIS READINESS AND PERSUASIVENESS OF SPEECH HIS INDUSTRY AND HIS GIFTS AT ONCE OF SWIFT INSIGHT AND ORDERLY THOROUGHNESS
1081-125237-0002 BUT THE OLD SORES REMAINED OPEN MOREOVER THE REFUSAL OF THE STATES GENERAL TO RECEIVE THE PARLIAMENTARY ENVOYS THE MURDER OF DORESLAER AND THE PROTECTION AFFORDED TO ROYALIST REFUGEES HAD BEEN ADDITIONAL CAUSES OF RESENTMENT
1081-125237-0003 BUT THE ENGLISH COUNCIL HAD NOT FELT STRONG ENOUGH TO TAKE ACTION THE DEATH OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0004 APPEARED AT FIRST TO OPEN OUT A PROSPECT OF FRIENDLIER RELATIONS BETWEEN THE TWO NEIGHBOURING REPUBLICS IN JANUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THE GREAT ASSEMBLY FORMALLY RECOGNISED THE COMMONWEALTH
1081-125237-0005 AND DETERMINED TO SEND BACK TO HIS OLD POST IN LONDON THE VETERAN AMBASSADOR JOACHIMI WHO HAD BEEN RECALLED THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT ON THEIR PART ANTICIPATED HIS RETURN BY DESPATCHING IN MARCH OLIVER SAINT JOHN AND WALTER STRICKLAND
1081-125237-0006 AND SAINT JOHN AND STRICKLAND GREETED WITH LOUD CRIES OF REGICIDES AND MANY ABUSIVE EPITHETS REMEMBERING THE FATE OF DORESLAER WERE IN FEAR OF THEIR LIVES
1081-125237-0007 ON APRIL FOURTH A CONFERENCE WAS OPENED BETWEEN THE ENVOYS AND SIX COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED BY THE STATES TO CONSIDER THE PROPOSALS OF THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT FOR A MORE STRICT AND INTIMATE ALLIANCE AND UNION BETWEEN THE TWO STATES THE DUTCH QUICKLY PERCEIVED
1081-125237-0008 THAT WHAT THE ENGLISH REALLY WANTED WAS NOTHING LESS THAN SUCH A BINDING ALLIANCE OR RATHER COALITION AS WOULD PRACTICALLY MERGE THE LESSER STATE IN THE GREATER BUT THE VERY IDEA OF SUCH A LOSS OF THE INDEPENDENCE THAT THEY HAD ONLY JUST WON WAS TO THE NETHERLANDERS UNTHINKABLE
1081-125237-0009 THE NEGOTIATIONS CAME TO A DEADLOCK
1081-125237-0010 FOREMOST AMONGST THEM PRINCE EDWARD SON OF THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA THE PARLIAMENT THREATENED TO RECALL THE ENVOYS BUT CONSENTED THAT THEY SHOULD REMAIN ON THE UNDERTAKING OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND TO PROTECT THEM FROM FURTHER ATTACKS AND TO PUNISH THE OFFENDERS
1081-125237-0011 NEW PROPOSALS WERE ACCORDINGLY MADE FOR AN OFFENSIVE AND DEFENSIVE ALLIANCE WITHOUT ANY SUGGESTION OF A UNION COUPLED WITH THE CONDITION THAT BOTH STATES SHOULD BIND THEMSELVES NOT TO ALLOW THE PRESENCE WITHIN THEIR BOUNDARIES OF AVOWED ENEMIES OF THE OTHER IN OTHER WORDS
1081-125237-0012 THE EXPULSION OF THE MEMBERS AND ADHERENTS OF THE HOUSE OF STEWART INCLUDING THE PRINCESS ROYAL AND THE QUEEN OF BOHEMIA WITH THEIR CHILDREN
1081-125237-0013 EVEN THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND DARED NOT CONSIDER SUCH TERMS AND THE STATES GENERAL WOULD HAVE ANGRILY REJECTED THEM AFTER SOME FURTHER PARLEYING THEREFORE ABOUT FISHERIES AND TRADE RESTRICTIONS IT WAS FELT THAT NO AGREEMENT COULD BE REACHED
1081-125237-0014 AND SAINT JOHN AND STRICKLAND RETURNED TO ENGLAND ON JULY THIRTY FIRST SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THEIR FAILURE CREATED A VERY BAD IMPRESSION UPON THE PARLIAMENT ALL THE OLD COMPLAINTS AGAINST THE DUTCH WERE REVIVED AND
1081-125237-0015 AS THEY HAD REFUSED THE OFFER OF FRIENDSHIP THAT HAD BEEN MADE TO THEM IT WAS RESOLVED THAT STRONG MEASURES SHOULD BE TAKEN TO OBTAIN REDRESS FOR PAST GRIEVANCES AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF ENGLISH TRADE INTERESTS AT THE INSTANCE OF SAINT JOHN
1081-125237-0016 THE FAMOUS NAVIGATION ACT WAS PASSED BY THE PARLIAMENT OCTOBER NINTH SIXTEEN FIFTY ONE THIS ACT STRUCK A MORTAL BLOW AT THE DUTCH CARRYING TRADE BY FORBIDDING THE IMPORTATION OF FOREIGN GOODS INTO ENGLISH PORTS EXCEPT IN ENGLISH BOTTOMS OR IN THOSE OF THE COUNTRIES WHICH HAD PRODUCED THE GOODS
1081-125237-0017 SCARCELY LESS INJURIOUS WAS THE PROHIBITION TO ALIENS TO FISH IN BRITISH WATERS AND THE WITHDRAWAL OF THE RIGHTS BASED ON THE MAGNUS INTERCURSUS FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF WHICH DUTCH STATESMEN HAD SO LONG AND STRENUOUSLY FOUGHT
1081-125237-0018 THERE WAS CONSTERNATION IN HOLLAND AND THE STATES GENERAL DETERMINED TO SEND A SPECIAL EMBASSY TO LONDON
1081-125237-0019 A MAN IN WHOSE RIPE JUDGMENT THEY HAD CONFIDENCE TO THE OFFICE OF COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0020 WHO HAVING BEEN GIVEN LETTERS OF MARQUE TO PREY UPON FRENCH COMMERCE
1081-125237-0021 THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT HOWEVER MET THE DUTCH COMPLAINTS BY RAKING UP THE LONG LIST OF GRIEVANCES THAT HAD STIRRED UP A BITTER FEELING OF POPULAR HATRED AGAINST THE UNITED PROVINCES IN ENGLAND AND BY DEMANDING REPARATION
1081-125237-0022 THEY FURTHER DEMANDED THAT DUTCH COMMANDERS SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE ENGLAND'S SOVEREIGNTY BY STRIKING FLAG AND SAIL AND BY FIRING A SALUTE WHENEVER ANY OF THEIR SQUADRONS MET ENGLISH SHIPS IN THE NARROW SEAS IT WAS THESE LAST TWO QUESTIONS
1081-125237-0023 THE RIGHT OF SEARCH AND THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG THAT WERE TO BE THE REAL CAUSES OF THE OUTBREAK OF A WAR THAT WAS DESIRED BY NEITHER OF THE TWO GOVERNMENTS BUT POPULAR FEELING AND THE COURSE OF EVENTS WAS TOO STRONG FOR THEM THE NEWS OF THE SEIZURE OF THEIR VESSELS
1081-125237-0024 NOT MERELY BY PRIVATEERS BUT BY AN ENGLISH SQUADRON UNDER AYSCUE IN THE WEST INDIES HAD CAUSED INTENSE INDIGNATION AND ALARM IN HOLLAND AND ESPECIALLY IN AMSTERDAM PRESSURE WAS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE STATES GENERAL AND THE ADMIRALTIES
1081-125237-0025 WHO IN PURSUANCE OF ECONOMY HAD REDUCED THE FLEET TO SEVENTY FIVE SHIPS IT WAS RESOLVED THEREFORE ON FEBRUARY TWENTY SECOND
1081-125237-0026 THE COUNCIL OF STATE ON HEARING OF THIS BEGAN ALSO TO MAKE READY FOR EVENTUALITIES NEGOTIATIONS WERE STILL PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTRIES WHEN MARTIN TROMP THE VICTOR OF THE BATTLE OF THE DOWNS
1081-125237-0027 NOW LIEUTENANT ADMIRAL OF HOLLAND WAS SENT TO SEA WITH FIFTY SHIPS AND INSTRUCTIONS TO PROTECT DUTCH MERCHANTMEN FROM INTERFERENCE AND TO SEE THAT THE STATES SUFFERED NO AFFRONT NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY SAID ABOUT THE STRIKING OF THE FLAG
1081-125237-0028 IT CAME SUDDENLY THROUGH A MISUNDERSTANDING THE DUTCH ADMIRAL WHILE CRUISING PAST DOVER MET ON MAY TWENTY NINTH FIFTEEN ENGLISH SHIPS UNDER BLAKE
1081-125237-0029 TROMP DECLARED THAT HE HAD GIVEN ORDERS TO STRIKE THE FLAG BUT THAT BLAKE AGAIN FIRED BEFORE THERE WAS TIME TO CARRY THEM OUT BE THIS AS IT MAY THE TWO FLEETS WERE SOON ENGAGED IN A REGULAR FIGHT AND THE ENGLISH BEING REINFORCED TROMP WITHDREW AT NIGHTFALL
1081-125237-0030 TO THE FRENCH COAST HAVING LOST TWO SHIPS GREAT WAS THE ANGER AROUSED IN ENGLAND WHERE THE DUTCH WERE UNIVERSALLY REGARDED AS THE AGGRESSORS IN THE NETHERLANDS WHERE THE PEACE PARTY WAS STRONG MANY WERE DISPOSED TO BLAME TROMP DESPITE HIS PROTESTS
1081-125237-0031 ADRIAN PAUW HIMSELF LEFT HASTILY FOR LONDON JOHN DE WITT BEING APPOINTED TO ACT AS HIS DEPUTY DURING HIS ABSENCE PAUW'S STRENUOUS EFFORTS HOWEVER TO MAINTAIN PEACE WERE ALL IN VAIN DESPITE THE STRONG LEANINGS OF CROMWELL TOWARDS A PEACEFUL SOLUTION
1081-125237-0032 BUT POPULAR FEELING ON BOTH SIDES WAS NOW AROUSED
1081-125237-0033 IF HUMILIATING TERMS WERE SUBMITTED TO STIFFENED THEIR ATTITUDE THE RESULT WAS THAT THE ENVOYS LEFT LONDON ON JUNE THIRTIETH SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO AND WAR WAS DECLARED THE DUTCH STATESMEN WHO SOUGHT TO AVOID HOSTILITIES WERE RIGHT
1081-125237-0034 ALL THE ADVANTAGES WERE ON THE SIDE OF THEIR ENEMIES THE DUTCH MERCHANT FLEETS COVERED THE SEAS AND THE WELFARE OF THE LAND DEPENDED ON COMMERCE THE ENGLISH HAD LITTLE TO LOSE COMMERCIALLY
1081-125237-0035 WAS SUPERIOR IN ALMOST ALL OTHER RESPECTS THE STUARTS HAD DEVOTED GREAT ATTENTION TO THE FLEET AND WOULD HAVE DONE MORE BUT FOR LACK OF MEANS CHARLES MUCH ABUSED SHIP MONEY WAS EMPLOYED BY HIM FOR THE CREATION OF THE FIRST ENGLISH PROFESSIONAL NAVY
1081-125237-0036 IT HAD BEEN LARGELY INCREASED BY THE PARLIAMENT AFTER SIXTEEN FORTY EIGHT AND ITS GENERALS BLAKE PENN AND AYSCUE HAD ALREADY ACQUIRED MUCH VALUABLE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR ENCOUNTERS WITH THE ROYALIST SQUADRON UNDER PRINCE RUPERT
1081-125237-0037 AND IN LONG CRUISES TO THE WEST INDIES FOR THE PURPOSE OF FORCING THE ENGLISH COLONIES TO ACKNOWLEDGE PARLIAMENTARY RULE THE CREWS THEREFORE WERE WELL TRAINED AND THE SHIPS WERE LARGER STRONGER AND BETTER ARMED THAN THOSE OF THE DUTCH
1081-125237-0038 THE POSITION OF ENGLAND LYING AS IT DID ATHWART THE ROUTES BY WHICH THE DUTCH MERCHANT FLEETS MUST SAIL WAS A GREAT ADVANTAGE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT WAS THE ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A CENTRAL CONTROL
1081-125237-0039 WHEREAS IN THE NETHERLANDS THERE WERE FIVE DISTINCT BOARDS OF ADMIRALTY TO SOME EXTENT JEALOUS OF EACH OTHER AND NOW LACKING THE SUPREME DIRECTION OF AN ADMIRAL GENERAL THE WAR BEGAN BY A SERIES OF ENGLISH SUCCESSES AND OF DUTCH MISFORTUNES
1081-125237-0040 EARLY IN JULY SIXTEEN FIFTY TWO BLAKE AT THE HEAD OF SIXTY SHIPS SET SAIL FOR THE NORTH TO INTERCEPT THE DUTCH BALTIC COMMERCE AND TO DESTROY THEIR FISHING FLEET OFF THE NORTH OF SCOTLAND
1081-125237-0041 HE LEFT AYSCUE WITH A SMALL SQUADRON TO GUARD THE MOUTH OF THE THAMES TROMP MEANWHILE HAD PUT TO SEA AT THE HEAD OF NEARLY A HUNDRED SHIPS AYSCUE SUCCEEDED IN INTERCEPTING A FLEET OF DUTCH MERCHANTMEN NEAR CALAIS
1081-125237-0042 ALL OF THEM BEING CAPTURED OR BURNT WHILE BLAKE WITH THE MAIN FORCE OFF THE NORTH COAST OF SCOTLAND DESTROYED THE DUTCH FISHING FLEET AND THEIR CONVOY AFTER THESE FIRST BLOWS AGAINST THE ENEMY'S COMMERCE GOOD FORTUNE CONTINUED TO ATTEND THE ENGLISH
1081-125237-0043 TROMP WAS PREVENTED FROM FOLLOWING BLAKE BY STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS HE THEN TURNED UPON AYSCUE WHOSE SMALL FORCE HE MUST HAVE OVERWHELMED BUT FOR A SUDDEN CHANGE TO A SOUTHERLY GALE THE DUTCH ADMIRAL NOW SAILED NORTHWARDS AND JULY TWENTY FIFTH
1081-125237-0044 FOUND THE ENGLISH FLEET OFF THE SHETLANDS A VIOLENT STORM AROSE FROM THE FORCE OF WHICH BLAKE WAS PROTECTED WHILE THE DUTCH VESSELS WERE SCATTERED FAR AND WIDE ON THE FOLLOWING DAY OUT OF NINETY NINE SHIPS TROMP COULD ONLY COLLECT THIRTY FIVE
1081-125237-0045 AND TO MEET AND CONVOY BACK THE HOME COMING SHIPS
1081-125237-0046 AYSCUE HAD PREVIOUSLY SAILED UP CHANNEL WITH FORTY MEN OF WAR AND FIVE FIRESHIPS FOR A SIMILAR PURPOSE THE TWO FLEETS MET ON AUGUST SIXTEENTH AND DESPITE HIS INFERIORITY OF FORCE DE RUYTER FORCED AYSCUE TO WITHDRAW INTO PLYMOUTH AND WAS ABLE TO BRING HIS CONVOY HOME TO SAFETY
1081-125237-0047 THE ILL SUCCESS OF TROMP THOUGH HE WAS IN NO WAY TO BLAME FOR IT CAUSED CONSIDERABLE ALARM AND DISCONTENT IN HOLLAND HIS ENEMIES OF THE STATES PARTY IN THAT PROVINCE TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT TO SUSPEND THE GALLANT OLD SEAMAN FROM HIS COMMAND HE WAS AN ORANGIST
1081-125237-0048 AND AS THE ORANGE PARTISANS WERE EVERYWHERE CLAMOROUSLY ACTIVE THE ADMIRAL WAS SUSPECT IN HIS PLACE CORNELISZ WITTE DE WITH WAS APPOINTED A CAPABLE SAILOR BUT DISLIKED IN THE FLEET AS MUCH AS TROMP WAS BELOVED DE WITH EFFECTED A JUNCTION WITH DE RUYTER
1081-125237-0049 AND WITH JOINT FORCES THEY ATTACKED BLAKE ON OCTOBER EIGHTH NEAR THE SHOAL KNOWN AS THE KENTISH KNOCK THE ENGLISH FLEET WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE POWERFUL THAN THE DUTCH AND THE DESERTION OF DE WITH BY SOME TWENTY SHIPS DECIDED THE ISSUE THE DUTCH HAD TO RETURN HOME WITH SOME LOSS
1081-125237-0050 BUT THEY WERE DECEIVED IN THINKING THAT THE STRUGGLE IN THE CHANNEL WAS OVER FOR THE WINTER THE DESERTERS AT THE KENTISH KNOCK WERE PUNISHED
1081-125237-0051 FULL OF RESENTMENT THOUGH HE WAS AT THE BAD TREATMENT HE HAD RECEIVED TROMP WAS TOO GOOD A PATRIOT TO REFUSE AT THE END OF NOVEMBER THE OLD ADMIRAL AT THE HEAD OF ONE HUNDRED WARSHIPS PUT TO SEA FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVOYING SOME FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MERCHANTMEN THROUGH THE STRAITS
1081-125237-0052 STORMY WEATHER COMPELLED HIM TO SEND THE CONVOY WITH AN ESCORT INTO SHELTER BUT HE HIMSELF WITH SIXTY SHIPS SET OUT TO SEEK THE ENGLISH FLEET WHICH LAY IN THE DOWNS AFTER SOME MANOEUVRING THE TWO FLEETS MET ON DECEMBER TENTH OFF DUNGENESS
1081-125237-0053 WHILE MANY ENGLISH PRIZES WERE CAPTURED THIS STATE OF THINGS WAS HOWEVER NOT TO LAST LONG TOWARDS THE END OF FEBRUARY SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE BLAKE PUT TO SEA WITH NEARLY EIGHTY SHIPS AND ON THE TWENTY FIFTH OFF PORTLAND MET TROMP AT THE HEAD OF A FORCE NEARLY EQUAL TO HIS OWN IN NUMBER
1081-125237-0054 AND HE HAD MOREOVER BEEN AT SEA WITHOUT REPLENISHMENT OF STORES EVER SINCE THE FIGHT AT DUNGENESS WHILE THE ENGLISH HAD COME STRAIGHT FROM PORT THE FIGHT
1081-125237-0055 HAD LASTED FOR TWO WHOLE DAYS WHEN TROMP FOUND THAT HIS POWDER HAD RUN OUT AND THAT ON THE THIRD DAY MORE THAN HALF HIS FLEET WERE UNABLE TO CONTINUE THE STRUGGLE BUT INSPIRING HIS SUBORDINATES DE RUYTER EVERTSEN AND FLORISZOON WITH HIS OWN INDOMITABLE COURAGE
1081-125237-0056 TROMP SUCCEEDED BY EXPERT SEAMANSHIP IN HOLDING OFF THE ENEMY AND CONDUCTING HIS CONVOY WITH SMALL LOSS INTO SAFETY
1081-125237-0057 MEANWHILE BOTH NATIONS HAD BEEN GETTING SICK OF THE WAR THE DUTCH WERE SUFFERING TERRIBLY FROM THE SERIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH THEIR COMMERCE AND CARRYING TRADE AND FROM THE DESTRUCTION OF THE IMPORTANT FISHERIES INDUSTRY
1081-125237-0058 WHILE THE ENGLISH ON THEIR SIDE WERE SHUT OUT FROM THE BALTIC WHERE THE KING OF DENMARK AS THE ALLY OF THE UNITED PROVINCES HAD CLOSED THE SOUND AND FROM THE MEDITERRANEAN WHERE ADMIRAL VAN GALEN
1081-125237-0059 DESTROYED A BRITISH SQUADRON OFF LEGHORN MARCH TWENTY THIRD IN BOTH COUNTRIES THERE WAS A PEACE PARTY
1081-125237-0060 AND WAS AVERSE TO WAR IN THE DUTCH REPUBLIC THE STATES PARTY ESPECIALLY IN HOLLAND THE CHIEF SUFFERER BY THE WAR WAS ANXIOUS FOR A CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES AND IT FOUND ITS LEADER IN THE YOUTHFUL JOHN DE WITT
1081-125237-0061 HAD BEEN APPOINTED COUNCIL PENSIONARY CROMWELL TOOK PAINS TO LET THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND KNOW HIS FAVOURABLE FEELINGS TOWARDS THEM BY SENDING OVER IN FEBRUARY A PRIVATE EMISSARY
1081-125237-0062 THUS EARLY DID THE NEW COUNCIL PENSIONARY INITIATE A FORM OF DIPLOMACY IN WHICH HE WAS TO PROVE HIMSELF AN ADEPT THIS FIRST EFFORT WAS NOT A SUCCESS THE PARLIAMENT PUBLISHED THE LETTER WITH THE TITLE HUMBLE SUPPLICATION OF THE STATES OF HOLLAND
1081-125237-0063 HE INDUCED THE STATES GENERAL BY A BARE MAJORITY FOUR PROVINCES TO THREE TO SEND A CONCILIATORY LETTER THE DATE OF WHICH APRIL THIRTIETH SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE COINCIDED WITH CROMWELL'S FORCIBLE DISSOLUTION OF THE RUMP PARLIAMENT AND THE ASSUMPTION BY HIM
1081-125237-0064 WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE ARMY OF DICTATORIAL POWERS
1081-125237-0065 AND THEIR INSISTENCE NOW ON THE FULL SATISFACTION OF ALL THE ENGLISH DEMANDS MADE A CONTINUATION OF HOSTILITIES INEVITABLE TROMP AFTER SUCCESSFULLY BRINGING IN TWO LARGE CONVOYS OF MERCHANTMEN ENCOUNTERED JUNE TWELFTH
1081-125237-0066 NEAR THE GABBARD THE ENGLISH FLEET UNDER MONK AND DEANE EACH FLEET NUMBERED ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SAIL BUT THE DUTCH SHIPS WERE INFERIOR IN SIZE SOLIDITY AND WEIGHT OF METAL FOR TWO DAYS THE FIGHT WAS OBSTINATELY AND FIERCELY CONTESTED
1081-125237-0067 TROMP WAS OBLIGED TO RETREAT HAVING LOST TWENTY SHIPS HE COMPLAINED BITTERLY AS DID HIS VICE ADMIRALS DE RUYTER AND DE WITH TO THE BOARD OF ADMIRALTY OF THE INFERIORITY OF THE VESSELS OF HIS FLEET AS COMPARED WITH THOSE OF THE ADVERSARY
1081-125237-0068 THE ENGLISH NOW INSTITUTED A BLOCKADE OF THE DUTCH COAST WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF REDUCING TO DESPERATE STRAITS A LAND WHOSE WELFARE AND PROSPERITY DEPENDED WHOLLY ON COMMERCE AMSTERDAM WAS RUINED IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES DIRECT NEGOTIATION WAS PERFORCE ATTEMPTED
1081-125237-0069 FOUR ENVOYS WERE SENT REPRESENTING THE THREE MARITIME PROVINCES AT FIRST IT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE THAT ANY COMMON GROUND OF AGREEMENT COULD BE FOUND CROMWELL WAS OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF A POLITICO RELIGIOUS UNION BETWEEN THE TWO REPUBLICS WHICH WOULD HAVE MEANT THE EXTINCTION OF DUTCH INDEPENDENCE
1081-125237-0070 UNA RESPUBLICA WHICH NOTHING BUT SHEER CONQUEST AND DIRE NECESSITY WOULD EVER INDUCE THE DUTCH PEOPLE TO ACCEPT ACCORDINGLY THE WAR WENT ON THOUGH THE ENVOYS DID NOT LEAVE LONDON HOPING STILL THAT SOME BETTER TERMS MIGHT BE OFFERED
1081-125237-0071 BUT IN ORDER TO GAIN BREATHING SPACE FOR THE EFFORTS OF THE NEGOTIATORS ONE THING WAS ESSENTIAL THE BREAKING OF THE BLOCKADE THE ADMIRALTIES MADE A SUPREME EFFORT TO REFIT AND REINFORCE THEIR FLEET BUT IT LAY IN TWO PORTIONS EIGHTY FIVE SAIL UNDER TROMP IN THE MAAS
1081-125237-0072 MONK WITH ABOUT ONE HUNDRED SHIPS LAY BETWEEN THEM TO PREVENT THEIR JUNCTION ON AUGUST FOURTH TROMP SAILED OUT AND AFTER A REARGUARD ACTION OFF KATWIJK OUT MANOEUVRED THE ENGLISH COMMANDER AND JOINED DE WITH HE NOW TURNED AND WITH SUPERIOR NUMBERS ATTACKED MONK OFF SCHEVENINGEN
1081-125237-0073 THE OLD HERO FELL MORTALLY WOUNDED AT THE VERY BEGINNING OF WHAT PROVED TO BE AN UNEQUAL FIGHT
1081-125237-0074 THE STATES THOUGH MUCH PERPLEXED TO FIND A SUCCESSOR TO MARTIN TROMP WERE SO FAR FROM BEING DISCOURAGED THAT GREAT ENERGY WAS SHOWN IN REORGANISING THE FLEET
1081-125237-0075 MEANWHILE NEGOTIATIONS HAD BEEN SLOWLY DRAGGING ON THE ACCESSION OF CROMWELL TO SUPREME POWER IN DECEMBER SIXTEEN FIFTY THREE WITH THE TITLE OF LORD PROTECTOR
1081-125237-0076 FOR THE NEW RULER OF ENGLAND HAD ALWAYS PROFESSED HIMSELF AN OPPONENT OF THE WAR WHICH HAD SHATTERED HIS FANTASTIC DREAM OF A UNION BETWEEN THE TWO REPUBLICS MANY CONFERENCES TOOK PLACE BUT THE PROTECTOR'S ATTITUDE AND INTENTIONS WERE AMBIGUOUS AND DIFFICULT TO DIVINE
1081-125237-0077 AT LAST CROMWELL FORMULATED HIS PROPOSALS IN TWENTY SEVEN ARTICLES THE DEMANDS WERE THOSE OF THE VICTOR AND WERE SEVERE ALL THE OLD DISPUTES WERE TO BE SETTLED IN FAVOUR OF ENGLAND AN ANNUAL SUM WAS TO BE PAID FOR THE RIGHT OF FISHING
1081-125237-0078 COMPENSATION TO BE MADE FOR THE MASSACRE OF AMBOINA AND THE OFFICIALS RESPONSIBLE FOR IT PUNISHED THE NUMBER OF WARSHIPS IN ENGLISH WATERS WAS TO BE LIMITED THE FLAG HAD TO BE STRUCK WHEN ENGLISH SHIPS WERE MET AND THE RIGHT OF SEARCH TO BE PERMITTED THESE DEMANDS
1081-125237-0079 ARTICLE TWELVE STIPULATED THAT THE PRINCE OF ORANGE SHOULD NOT AT ANY TIME HOLD ANY OF THE OFFICES OR DIGNITIES WHICH HAD BEEN HELD BY HIS ANCESTORS OR BE APPOINTED TO ANY MILITARY COMMAND
1081-125237-0080 WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT IT WOULD BE USELESS TO PRESENT SUCH PROPOSALS TO THE STATES GENERAL NOT ONLY WOULD THEY INDIGNANTLY REJECT THEM BUT HE HAD NOT THE SLIGHTEST HOPE OF GETTING ANY SINGLE PROVINCE EVEN HOLLAND TO ALLOW A FOREIGN POWER TO INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS
1081-125237-0081 AND TO BID THEM TO TREAT WITH HARSH INGRATITUDE THE INFANT HEIR OF A FAMILY TO WHICH THE DUTCH PEOPLE OWED SO DEEP A DEBT THERE WAS NOTHING FOR IT BUT TO PREPARE FOR A VIGOROUS RESUMPTION OF THE WAR STRONG EFFORTS WERE THEREFORE MADE AT DE WITT'S INSTIGATION
1081-125237-0082 TO INCREASE THE FLEET AND SECURE THE ACTIVE CO OPERATION OF DENMARK AND FRANCE BOTH FRIENDLY TO THE STATES BUT CROMWELL REALLY WANTED PEACE AND SHOWED HIMSELF READY TO YIELD ON CERTAIN MINOR POINTS BUT HE CONTINUED TO INSIST ON THE EXCLUSION OF THE PRINCE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0083 NOT TILL THE DUTCH ENVOYS HAD DEMANDED THEIR PASSPORTS DID THE PROTECTOR GIVE WAY SO FAR AS TO SAY HE WOULD BE CONTENT TO HAVE THE EXCLUSION GUARANTEED BY A SECRET ARTICLE WHAT FOLLOWED FORMS ONE OF THE STRANGEST CHAPTERS IN THE HISTORY OF DIPLOMACY
1081-125237-0084 HE WAS ABLE TO REACH THE PRIVATE EAR OF CROMWELL AND TO ENTER INTO CLANDESTINE NEGOTIATIONS WITH HIM THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY KNEW WELL THE HOPELESSNESS OF ANY ATTEMPT TO GET THE ASSENT OF THE STATES GENERAL TO THE PROPOSED EXCLUSION EVEN IN A SECRET ARTICLE
1081-125237-0085 OF THE STATE OF PUBLIC FEELING ON THIS POINT WITH THE RESULT THAT THE PROTECTOR GAVE THE ENVOY TO UNDERSTAND THAT HE WOULD BE SATISFIED IF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND ALONE WOULD AFFIRM A DECLARATION THAT THE PRINCE SHOULD NEVER BE APPOINTED STADHOLDER OR CAPTAIN GENERAL WHETHER THIS CONCESSION WAS OFFERED BY CROMWELL PROPRIO MOTU
1081-125237-0086 IN ANY CASE THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY BEING CONVINCED OF THE NECESSITY OF PEACE RESOLVED TO SECURE IT BY PLAYING A VERY DEEP AND DANGEROUS GAME NOT ONLY MUST THE WHOLE AFFAIR BE KEPT ABSOLUTELY FROM THE COGNISANCE OF THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0087 BUT ALSO DE WITT WAS FULLY AWARE THAT THE ASSENT OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND TO THE PROPOSED EXCLUSION ARTICLE COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED WITH THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY HE WAS TO PROVE HIMSELF A VERY PAST MASTER IN THE ART OF DIPLOMATIC CHICANERY AND INTRIGUE
1081-125237-0088 THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY FIRST SET TO WORK TO HAVE THE TREATY FROM WHICH THE EXCLUSION ARTICLE HAD BEEN CUT OUT RATIFIED RAPIDLY BY THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0089 THE ESTATES ADJOURNED FOR A RECESS ON APRIL TWENTY FIRST SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR ON THE FOLLOWING DAY HE PRESENTED THE TREATY TO THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0090 AND SUCH WAS HIS PERSUASIVE SKILL THAT HE ACCOMPLISHED THE UNPRECEDENTED FEAT OF GETTING THIS DILATORY BODY TO ACCEPT THE CONDITIONS OF PEACE ALMOST WITHOUT DISCUSSION
1081-125237-0091 THE TREATY RATIFIED AND SIGNED WAS SENT BACK TO LONDON ONLY ONE ARTICLE AROUSED OPPOSITION
1081-125237-0092 THE SO CALLED TEMPERAMENT CLAUSE BUT CROMWELL HAD INSISTED UPON IT BY THIS ARTICLE
1081-125237-0093 OR COMMANDER OF MILITARY OR NAVAL FORCES
1081-125237-0094 ADDRESSED TO THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND NOT AT THE MOMENT IN SESSION
1081-125237-0095 THE CLEVERNESS AND SKILL NOW SHOWN BY THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY WERE TRULY EXTRAORDINARY A SUMMONS WAS SENT OUT TO THE ESTATES TO MEET ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH WITHOUT ANY REASON BEING ASSIGNED THE MEMBERS ON ASSEMBLY WERE SWORN TO SECRECY
1081-125237-0096 AND THEN THE OFFICIAL LETTER FROM LONDON WAS READ TO THEM
1081-125237-0097 TO THE ACT OF EXCLUSION CAME UPON THE ESTATES LIKE A THUNDER BOLT THE SUDDEN DEMAND CAUSED SOMETHING LIKE CONSTERNATION AND THE MEMBERS ASKED TO BE ALLOWED TO CONSIDER THE MATTER WITH THEIR PRINCIPALS BEFORE TAKING SO MOMENTOUS A DECISION THREE DAYS WERE GRANTED
1081-125237-0098 BUT AS IT WAS ESSENTIAL TO PREVENT PUBLICITY IT WAS SETTLED THAT ONLY THE BURGOMASTERS SHOULD BE CONSULTED AGAIN UNDER OATH OF SECRECY AT THE MEETING ON MAY FIRST
1081-125237-0099 THAT THE ACT SHOULD BE PLACED IN HIS HANDS WITHIN TWO DAYS AFTER THE RATIFICATION OF THE TREATY WAS PEREMPTORY AND THREATENING UNLESS HE RECEIVED THE ACT HE WOULD CONSIDER THE TREATY AS NOT BINDING UPON HIM USING ALL HIS POWERS OF ADVOCACY
1081-125237-0100 DE WITT SUCCEEDED AFTER AN ANGRY DEBATE IN SECURING A MAJORITY FOR THE ACT FIVE TOWNS HOWEVER OBSTINATELY REFUSED THEIR ASSENT AND CLAIMED THAT IT COULD NOT BE PASSED WITHOUT IT BUT DE WITT HAD MADE UP HIS MIND TO RISK ILLEGALITY
1081-125237-0101 AND OVERRULED THEIR PROTEST THE ACT WAS DECLARED TO HAVE BEEN PASSED AND WAS ON MAY FIFTH SENT TO VAN BEVERNINGH AND NIEUWPOORT WITH INSTRUCTIONS NOT TO DELIVER IT UNTIL CIRCUMSTANCES COMPELLED THEM TO DO SO
1081-125237-0102 BUT FOR SOME FIVE WEEKS THE EXISTENCE OF THE ACT WAS UNKNOWN TO THE STATES GENERAL AND DURING THAT PERIOD
1081-125237-0103 EARLY IN JUNE A BRIBE INDUCED ONE OF DE WITT'S CLERKS TO BETRAY THE SECRET TO COUNT WILLIAM FREDERICK THE NEWS SOON SPREAD AND LOUD WAS THE OUTCRY OF THE ORANGE PARTISANS AND OF THE TWO PRINCESSES WHO AT ONCE ADDRESSED A REMONSTRANCE TO THE STATES GENERAL
1081-125237-0104 ALL THE OTHER PROVINCES STRONGLY PROTESTED AGAINST THE ACTION OF THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND AND OF THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY DE WITT ATTEMPTED TO DEFEND HIMSELF AND THE ESTATES BY VAGUE STATEMENTS AVOIDING THE MAIN ISSUE BUT INSISTING THAT NOTHING ILLEGAL HAD BEEN DONE HIS EFFORTS WERE IN VAIN
1081-125237-0105 ALL THE SECRET INSTRUCTIONS THEY HAD RECEIVED FROM HOLLAND AND THE ACT OF EXCLUSION MEANWHILE THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND THEMSELVES FRIGHTENED AT THE CLAMOUR WHICH HAD BEEN AROUSED BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF DEFECTION
1081-125237-0106 THEY WENT SO FAR AS TO PASS A VOTE OF THANKS TO THE ENVOYS FOR NOT HAVING DELIVERED THE ACT TO CROMWELL DE WITT'S POSITION APPEARED HOPELESS
1081-125237-0107 HIS EFFORTS TO PREVENT THE RESOLUTION OF THE STATES GENERAL FROM TAKING IMMEDIATE EFFECT PROVING UNAVAILING HE PUT FORWARD THE SUGGESTION THAT ON ACCOUNT OF ITS IMPORTANCE THE DESPATCH SHOULD BE SENT TO THE ENVOYS IN CIPHER
1081-125237-0108 THIS WAS AGREED TO AND ON JUNE SEVENTH THE DOCUMENT WAS DULY FORWARDED TO LONDON BY THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0109 INFORMING THEM THAT THE ESTATES OF HOLLAND ASSENTED TO THE REQUEST MADE BY THE STATES GENERAL AND THAT THEY WERE TO SEND BACK THE SECRET CORRESPONDENCE AND ALSO THE ACT IF IT WERE STILL UNDELIVERED THE RESULT ANSWERED TO HIS EXPECTATIONS
1081-125237-0110 WHILE THE CLERK WAS LABORIOUSLY DECIPHERING THE DESPATCH THE ENVOYS READ BETWEEN THE LINES OF DE WITT'S LETTER AND WITHOUT A MOMENT'S DELAY WENT TO WHITEHALL AND PLACED THE ACT IN CROMWELL'S HANDS THE STATES GENERAL HAD THUS NO ALTERNATIVE BETWEEN ACCEPTANCE OF THE FAIT ACCOMPLI
1081-125237-0111 AND THE RISK OF A RENEWAL OF THE WAR NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN AND THE PROTECTOR PROFESSED HIMSELF SATISFIED WITH A GUARANTEE OF SUCH DOUBTFUL VALIDITY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO WITHHOLD ADMIRATION FROM DE WITT'S MARVELLOUS DIPLOMATIC DEXTERITY
1081-125237-0112 AND FROM THE SKILL AND COURAGE WITH WHICH HE ACHIEVED HIS END IN THE FACE OF OBSTACLES AND DIFFICULTIES THAT SEEMED INSURMOUNTABLE BUT FOR THE COURSE OF DOUBLE DEALING AND CHICANERY BY WHICH HE TRIUMPHED THE ONLY DEFENCE THAT CAN BE OFFERED IS THAT THE COUNCIL PENSIONARY
1081-125237-0113 REALLY BELIEVED THAT PEACE WAS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THAT PEACE COULD ONLY BE MAINTAINED AT THE COST OF THE ACT OF EXCLUSION
1081-125237-0114 THERE IS HOWEVER EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT DE WITT WAS PROMPTED TO TAKE THE RISKS HE DID BY PURELY PATRIOTIC MOTIVES AND NOT THROUGH SPITE AGAINST THE HOUSE OF ORANGE
1081-125237-0115 NOT MERELY BY THE ORANGE PARTISANS BUT BY POPULAR OPINION GENERALLY IN THE UNITED PROVINCES

1088-129236-0000 EVERY PROMISE OF THE SOUL HAS INNUMERABLE FULFILMENTS EACH OF ITS JOYS RIPENS INTO A NEW WANT NATURE UNCONTAINABLE FLOWING FORELOOKING
1088-129236-0001 IN THE FIRST SENTIMENT OF KINDNESS ANTICIPATES ALREADY A BENEVOLENCE WHICH SHALL LOSE ALL PARTICULAR REGARDS IN ITS GENERAL LIGHT THE INTRODUCTION TO THIS FELICITY IS IN A PRIVATE AND TENDER RELATION OF ONE TO ONE WHICH IS THE ENCHANTMENT OF HUMAN LIFE
1088-129236-0002 UNITES HIM TO HIS RACE PLEDGES HIM TO THE DOMESTIC AND CIVIC RELATIONS CARRIES HIM WITH NEW SYMPATHY INTO NATURE ENHANCES THE POWER OF THE SENSES OPENS THE IMAGINATION ADDS TO HIS CHARACTER HEROIC AND SACRED ATTRIBUTES
1088-129236-0003 ESTABLISHES MARRIAGE AND GIVES PERMANENCE TO HUMAN SOCIETY THE NATURAL ASSOCIATION OF THE SENTIMENT OF LOVE WITH THE HEYDAY OF THE BLOOD SEEMS TO REQUIRE THAT IN ORDER TO PORTRAY IT IN VIVID TINTS WHICH EVERY YOUTH AND MAID SHOULD CONFESS TO BE TRUE TO THEIR THROBBING EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0004 ONE MUST NOT BE TOO OLD THE DELICIOUS FANCIES OF YOUTH REJECT THE LEAST SAVOR OF A MATURE PHILOSOPHY AS CHILLING WITH AGE AND PEDANTRY THEIR PURPLE BLOOM
1088-129236-0005 AND THEREFORE I KNOW I INCUR THE IMPUTATION OF UNNECESSARY HARDNESS AND STOICISM FROM THOSE WHO COMPOSE THE COURT AND PARLIAMENT OF LOVE BUT FROM THESE FORMIDABLE CENSORS I SHALL APPEAL TO MY SENIORS
1088-129236-0006 FOR IT IS TO BE CONSIDERED THAT THIS PASSION OF WHICH WE SPEAK THOUGH IT BEGIN WITH THE YOUNG YET FORSAKES NOT THE OLD OR RATHER SUFFERS NO ONE WHO IS TRULY ITS SERVANT TO GROW OLD
1088-129236-0007 GLOWS AND ENLARGES UNTIL IT WARMS AND BEAMS UPON MULTITUDES OF MEN AND WOMEN UPON THE UNIVERSAL HEART OF ALL AND SO LIGHTS UP THE WHOLE WORLD AND ALL NATURE WITH ITS GENEROUS FLAMES
1088-129236-0008 ONLY IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT BY PATIENCE AND THE MUSES AID WE MAY ATTAIN TO THAT INWARD VIEW OF THE LAW WHICH SHALL DESCRIBE A TRUTH EVER YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL SO CENTRAL THAT IT SHALL COMMEND ITSELF TO THE EYE AT WHATEVER ANGLE BEHOLDEN
1088-129236-0009 AND THE FIRST CONDITION IS THAT WE MUST LEAVE A TOO CLOSE AND LINGERING ADHERENCE TO FACTS AND STUDY THE SENTIMENT AS IT APPEARED IN HOPE AND NOT IN HISTORY FOR EACH MAN SEES HIS OWN LIFE DEFACED AND DISFIGURED
1088-129236-0010 WHICH HAVE GIVEN HIM SINCEREST INSTRUCTION AND NOURISHMENT HE WILL SHRINK AND MOAN ALAS I KNOW NOT WHY BUT INFINITE COMPUNCTIONS EMBITTER IN MATURE LIFE THE REMEMBRANCES OF BUDDING JOY AND COVER EVERY BELOVED NAME
1088-129236-0011 DWELL CARE AND CANKER AND FEAR WITH THOUGHT WITH THE IDEAL IS IMMORTAL HILARITY THE ROSE OF JOY ROUND IT ALL THE MUSES SING BUT GRIEF CLEAVES TO NAMES AND PERSONS AND THE PARTIAL INTERESTS OF TO DAY AND YESTERDAY
1088-129236-0012 THE STRONG BENT OF NATURE IS SEEN IN THE PROPORTION WHICH THIS TOPIC OF PERSONAL RELATIONS USURPS IN THE CONVERSATION OF SOCIETY WHAT DO WE WISH TO KNOW OF ANY WORTHY PERSON SO MUCH AS HOW HE HAS SPED IN THE HISTORY OF THIS SENTIMENT
1088-129236-0013 AND WHAT FASTENS ATTENTION IN THE INTERCOURSE OF LIFE LIKE ANY PASSAGE BETRAYING AFFECTION BETWEEN TWO PARTIES PERHAPS WE NEVER SAW THEM BEFORE AND NEVER SHALL MEET THEM AGAIN BUT WE SEE THEM EXCHANGE A GLANCE OR BETRAY A DEEP EMOTION AND WE ARE NO LONGER STRANGERS
1088-129236-0014 IT IS THE DAWN OF CIVILITY AND GRACE IN THE COARSE AND RUSTIC THE RUDE VILLAGE BOY TEASES THE GIRLS ABOUT THE SCHOOL HOUSE DOOR BUT TO DAY HE COMES RUNNING INTO THE ENTRY AND MEETS ONE FAIR CHILD DISPOSING HER SATCHEL
1088-129236-0015 HE HOLDS HER BOOKS TO HELP HER AND INSTANTLY IT SEEMS TO HIM AS IF SHE REMOVED HERSELF FROM HIM INFINITELY AND WAS A SACRED PRECINCT AMONG THE THRONG OF GIRLS HE RUNS RUDELY ENOUGH BUT ONE ALONE DISTANCES HIM
1088-129236-0016 FOR PERSONS ARE LOVE'S WORLD AND THE COLDEST PHILOSOPHER CANNOT RECOUNT THE DEBT OF THE YOUNG SOUL WANDERING HERE IN NATURE TO THE POWER OF LOVE WITHOUT BEING TEMPTED TO UNSAY AS TREASONABLE TO NATURE AUGHT DEROGATORY TO THE SOCIAL INSTINCTS
1088-129236-0017 YET THE REMEMBRANCE OF THESE VISIONS OUTLASTS ALL OTHER REMEMBRANCES AND IS A WREATH OF FLOWERS ON THE OLDEST BROWS BUT HERE IS A STRANGE FACT IT MAY SEEM TO MANY MEN IN REVISING THEIR EXPERIENCE
1088-129236-0018 THAT THEY HAVE NO FAIRER PAGE IN THEIR LIFE'S BOOK THAN THE DELICIOUS MEMORY OF SOME PASSAGES WHEREIN AFFECTION CONTRIVED TO GIVE A WITCHCRAFT SURPASSING THE DEEP ATTRACTION OF ITS OWN TRUTH TO A PARCEL OF ACCIDENTAL AND TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCES
1088-129236-0019 NO MAN EVER FORGOT THE VISITATIONS OF THAT POWER TO HIS HEART AND BRAIN WHICH CREATED ALL THINGS ANEW WHICH WAS THE DAWN IN HIM OF MUSIC POETRY AND ART WHICH MADE THE FACE OF NATURE RADIANT WITH PURPLE LIGHT
1088-129236-0020 THE MORNING AND THE NIGHT VARIED ENCHANTMENTS WHEN A SINGLE TONE OF ONE VOICE COULD MAKE THE HEART BOUND AND THE MOST TRIVIAL CIRCUMSTANCE ASSOCIATED WITH ONE FORM IS PUT IN THE AMBER OF MEMORY
1088-129236-0021 WHEN NO PLACE IS TOO SOLITARY AND NONE TOO SILENT FOR HIM WHO HAS RICHER COMPANY AND SWEETER CONVERSATION IN HIS NEW THOUGHTS THAN ANY OLD FRIENDS THOUGH BEST AND PUREST CAN GIVE HIM FOR THE FIGURES THE MOTIONS
1088-129236-0022 THE WORDS OF THE BELOVED OBJECT ARE NOT LIKE OTHER IMAGES WRITTEN IN WATER BUT AS PLUTARCH SAID ENAMELLED IN FIRE AND MAKE THE STUDY OF MIDNIGHT THOU ART NOT GONE BEING GONE WHERE'ER THOU ART
1088-129236-0023 THY LOVING HEART IN THE NOON AND THE AFTERNOON OF LIFE WE STILL THROB AT THE RECOLLECTION OF DAYS WHEN HAPPINESS WAS NOT HAPPY ENOUGH BUT MUST BE DRUGGED WITH THE RELISH OF PAIN AND FEAR FOR HE TOUCHED THE SECRET OF THE MATTER WHO SAID OF LOVE
1088-129236-0024 ALL OTHER PLEASURES ARE NOT WORTH ITS PAINS AND WHEN THE DAY WAS NOT LONG ENOUGH BUT THE NIGHT TOO MUST BE CONSUMED IN KEEN RECOLLECTIONS WHEN THE HEAD BOILED ALL NIGHT ON THE PILLOW WITH THE GENEROUS DEED IT RESOLVED ON
1088-129236-0025 THE CLOUDS HAVE FACES AS HE LOOKS ON THEM THE TREES OF THE FOREST THE WAVING GRASS AND THE PEEPING FLOWERS HAVE GROWN INTELLIGENT AND HE ALMOST FEARS TO TRUST THEM WITH THE SECRET WHICH THEY SEEM TO INVITE YET NATURE SOOTHES AND SYMPATHIZES
1088-129236-0026 A MIDNIGHT BELL A PASSING GROAN THESE ARE THE SOUNDS WE FEED UPON BEHOLD THERE IN THE WOOD THE FINE MADMAN HE IS A PALACE OF SWEET SOUNDS AND SIGHTS HE DILATES HE IS TWICE A MAN
1088-129236-0027 HE WALKS WITH ARMS AKIMBO HE SOLILOQUIZES HE ACCOSTS THE GRASS AND THE TREES HE FEELS THE BLOOD OF THE VIOLET THE CLOVER AND THE LILY IN HIS VEINS AND HE TALKS WITH THE BROOK THAT WETS HIS FOOT
1088-129236-0028 THE HEATS THAT HAVE OPENED HIS PERCEPTIONS OF NATURAL BEAUTY HAVE MADE HIM LOVE MUSIC AND VERSE IT IS A FACT OFTEN OBSERVED THAT MEN HAVE WRITTEN GOOD VERSES UNDER THE INSPIRATION OF PASSION WHO CANNOT WRITE WELL UNDER ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES
1088-129236-0029 THE LIKE FORCE HAS THE PASSION OVER ALL HIS NATURE IT EXPANDS THE SENTIMENT IT MAKES THE CLOWN GENTLE AND GIVES THE COWARD HEART
1088-129236-0030 INTO THE MOST PITIFUL AND ABJECT IT WILL INFUSE A HEART AND COURAGE TO DEFY THE WORLD SO ONLY IT HAVE THE COUNTENANCE OF THE BELOVED OBJECT IN GIVING HIM TO ANOTHER IT STILL MORE GIVES HIM TO HIMSELF
1088-134315-0000 AS YOU KNOW AND AS I HAVE GIVEN YOU PROOF I HAVE THE GREATEST ADMIRATION IN THE WORLD FOR ONE WHOSE WORK FOR HUMANITY HAS WON SUCH UNIVERSAL RECOGNITION I HOPE THAT WE SHALL BOTH FORGET THIS UNHAPPY MORNING AND THAT YOU WILL GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF RENDERING TO YOU IN PERSON
1088-134315-0001 THE APOLOGIES WHICH ARE DUE TO YOU I FEEL THAT ANYTHING LESS WILL NEITHER REHABILITATE ME IN YOUR ESTEEM NOR SECURE FOR ME THE REMNANTS OF MY SHATTERED SELF RESPECT I AM HOPING YOU WILL DINE WITH ME NEXT WEEK AND MEET A MOST INTERESTING MAN GEORGE GATHERCOLE
1088-134315-0002 TO DISTURB A RELATIONSHIP WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS HOPED WOULD BE MUTUALLY PLEASANT IF YOU WILL ALLOW GATHERCOLE WHO WILL BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THE PART HE IS PLAYING TO ACT AS PEACEMAKER BETWEEN YOURSELF AND MYSELF

1088-134315-0006 IF HE EXPECTED HER TO GIVE HIM ANY ENCOURAGEMENT TO PROCEED HE WAS DISAPPOINTED PROBABLY HE REQUIRED NO SUCH ENCOURAGEMENT FOR IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS SOCIAL INFERIORS HE WAS SOMEWHAT MONOPOLIZING CUT A MAN'S FLESH AND IT HEALS HE SAID
1088-134315-0007 WHIP A MAN AND THE MEMORY OF IT PASSES FRIGHTEN HIM FILL HIM WITH A SENSE OF FOREBODING AND APPREHENSION AND LET HIM BELIEVE THAT SOMETHING DREADFUL IS GOING TO HAPPEN EITHER TO HIMSELF OR TO SOMEONE HE LOVES BETTER THE LATTER

1088-134315-0011 IF I CAN BUY IT WELL AND GOOD IF I CAN BUY THOSE WHO CAN USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO SECURE THIS THING FOR ME SO MUCH THE BETTER IF I CAN OBTAIN IT BY ANY MERIT I POSSESS I UTILIZE THAT MERIT
1088-134315-0012 PROVIDING ALWAYS THAT I CAN SECURE MY OBJECT IN THE TIME OTHERWISE HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS I SEE SHE SAID NODDING HER HEAD QUICKLY I SUPPOSE THAT IS HOW BLACKMAILERS FEEL HE FROWNED

1088-134315-0016 HE LIFTED HIS SHOULDERS WITH A DEPRECATING SMILE I SHALL CERTAINLY NOT DISCUSS YOUR BUSINESS WITH ANY PERSON SAID THE GIRL COLDLY I AM PAYING YOU THREE POUNDS A WEEK I THINK HE SAID
1088-134315-0017 I INTEND INCREASING THAT TO FIVE POUNDS BECAUSE YOU SUIT ME MOST ADMIRABLY THANK YOU SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY BUT I AM ALREADY BEING PAID QUITE SUFFICIENT SHE LEFT HIM A LITTLE ASTONISHED AND NOT A LITTLE RUFFLED
1088-134315-0018 TO REFUSE THE FAVOURS OF REMINGTON KARA WAS BY HIM REGARDED AS SOMETHING OF AN AFFRONT
1088-134315-0019 HE RANG THE BELL THIS TIME FOR HIS VALET FISHER HE SAID I AM EXPECTING A VISIT FROM A GENTLEMAN NAMED GATHERCOLE A ONE ARMED GENTLEMAN WHOM YOU MUST LOOK AFTER IF HE COMES

1088-134315-0024 THAT HE SHOULD RETURN TO KARA'S STUDY AND SET THE PAPERS IN ORDER WAS NATURAL AND PROPER THAT HE SHOULD CONDUCT A RAPID EXAMINATION OF ALL THE DRAWERS IN KARA'S DESK MIGHT BE EXCUSED ON THE SCORE OF DILIGENCE SINCE HE WAS TO SOME EXTENT IN THE CONFIDENCE OF HIS EMPLOYER
1088-134315-0025 KARA WAS GIVEN TO MAKING FRIENDS OF HIS SERVANTS UP TO A POINT IN HIS MORE GENEROUS MOMENTS HE WOULD ADDRESS HIS BODYGUARD AS FRED AND ON MORE OCCASIONS THAN ONE AND FOR NO APPARENT REASON HAD TIPPED HIS SERVANT OVER AND ABOVE HIS SALARY
1088-134315-0026 MISTER FRED FISHER FOUND LITTLE TO REWARD HIM FOR HIS SEARCH UNTIL HE CAME UPON KARA'S CHEQUE BOOK WHICH TOLD HIM THAT ON THE PREVIOUS DAY THE GREEK HAD DRAWN SIX THOUSAND POUNDS IN CASH FROM THE BANK
1088-134315-0027 THIS INTERESTED HIM MIGHTILY AND HE REPLACED THE CHEQUE BOOK WITH THE TIGHTENED LIPS AND THE FIXED GAZE OF A MAN WHO WAS THINKING RAPIDLY HE PAID A VISIT TO THE LIBRARY WHERE THE SECRETARY WAS ENGAGED IN MAKING COPIES OF KARA'S CORRESPONDENCE
1088-134315-0028 ANSWERING LETTERS APPEALING FOR CHARITABLE DONATIONS AND IN THE HACK WORDS WHICH FALL TO THE SECRETARIES OF THE GREAT HE REPLENISHED THE FIRE ASKED DEFERENTIALLY FOR ANY INSTRUCTIONS AND RETURNED AGAIN TO HIS QUEST

1088-134315-0037 EITHER BY LOOSENING HIS HOLD OF THE VOLUMES OR RAISING HIS HAND ACCIDENTALLY THE VALET'S HAND PRESSED AGAINST THE OTHER'S SLEEVE AND HE RECEIVED A SHOCK FOR THE FOREARM WAS CLEARLY AN ARTIFICIAL ONE IT WAS AGAINST A WOODEN SURFACE BENEATH THE SLEEVE THAT HIS KNUCKLES STRUCK
1088-134315-0038 AND THIS VIEW OF THE STRANGER'S INFIRMITY WAS CONFIRMED WHEN THE OTHER REACHED ROUND WITH HIS RIGHT HAND TOOK HOLD OF THE GLOVED LEFT HAND AND THRUST IT INTO THE POCKET OF HIS OVERCOAT WHERE IS KARA GROWLED THE STRANGER

1088-134315-0046 SHE HANDED HIM THE LETTER AND HE READ WITHOUT A DROOP OF EYELID THE SUPERSCRIPTION
1088-134315-0047 SPECIAL SERVICE DEPARTMENT SCOTLAND YARD WHITEHALL HE PUT IT CAREFULLY IN HIS POCKET AND WENT FROM THE ROOM TO CHANGE LARGE AS THE HOUSE WAS KARA DID NOT EMPLOY A REGULAR STAFF OF SERVANTS A MAID AND A VALET COMPRISED THE WHOLE OF THE INDOOR STAFF
1088-134315-0048 THE ONLY OTHER PERSON IN THE HOUSE BESIDE THE GIRL WAS THE MIDDLE AGED DOMESTIC WHO WAS PARLOUR MAID SERVING MAID AND HOUSEKEEPER IN ONE MISS HOLLAND SAT AT HER DESK TO ALL APPEARANCE READING OVER THE LETTERS SHE HAD TYPED THAT AFTERNOON
1088-134315-0049 BUT HER MIND WAS VERY FAR FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE BEFORE HER SHE HEARD THE SOFT THUD OF THE FRONT DOOR CLOSING AND RISING SHE CROSSED THE ROOM RAPIDLY AND LOOKED DOWN THROUGH THE WINDOW TO THE STREET SHE WATCHED FISHER UNTIL HE WAS OUT OF SIGHT
1088-134315-0050 THE MAID WHO WAS ALSO COOK AROSE UP AS THE GIRL ENTERED IT'S A SIGHT FOR SORE EYES TO SEE YOU IN MY KITCHEN MISS SHE SMILED I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RATHER LONELY MISSUS BEALE SAID THE GIRL SYMPATHETICALLY LONELY MISS CRIED THE MAID

1088-134315-0052 I KNOW HE GOES IN SOMETIMES BECAUSE I TRIED A DODGE THAT MY BROTHER WHO'S A POLICEMAN TAUGHT ME I STRETCHED A BIT OF WHITE COTTON ACROSS IT AN IT WAS BROKE THE NEXT MORNING MISTER KARA KEEPS SOME OF HIS PRIVATE PAPERS IN THERE SAID THE GIRL QUIETLY HE HAS TOLD ME SO HIMSELF

1088-134315-0054 THE GIRL ASCENDED TO THE UPPER FLOOR AGAIN SHE WATCHED FROM THE WINDOW THE DISAPPEARING FIGURE ONCE OUT OF SIGHT MISS HOLLAND WENT TO WORK WITH A REMARKABLE DELIBERATION AND THOROUGHNESS FROM HER BAG SHE PRODUCED A SMALL PURSE AND OPENED IT
1088-134315-0055 IN THAT CASE WAS A NEW STEEL KEY
1088-134315-0056 IN TWO SECONDS IT WAS OPEN AND SHE WAS EXAMINING ITS CONTENTS IT WAS A LARGE SAFE OF THE USUAL TYPE THERE WERE FOUR STEEL DRAWERS FITTED AT THE BACK AND AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STRONG BOX
1088-134315-0057 AN EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST DRAWER DID NOT PRODUCE ALL THAT SHE HAD EXPECTED SHE RETURNED THE PAPERS TO THE DRAWER PUSHED IT TO AND LOCKED IT SHE GAVE HER ATTENTION TO THE SECOND DRAWER HER HAND SHOOK A LITTLE AS SHE PULLED IT OPEN
1088-134315-0058 IT WAS A SQUARE CASE COVERED IN RED MOROCCO LEATHER SHE INSERTED HER SHAKING HAND AND TOOK IT OUT WITH A TRIUMPHANT LITTLE CRY AT LAST SHE SAID ALOUD AND THEN A HAND GRASPED HER WRIST AND IN A PANIC SHE TURNED TO MEET THE SMILING FACE
1088-134318-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE KARA LAY BACK ON HIS DOWN PILLOWS WITH A SNEER ON HIS FACE AND HIS BRAIN VERY BUSY WHAT STARTED THE TRAIN OF THOUGHT HE DID NOT KNOW BUT AT THAT MOMENT HIS MIND WAS VERY FAR AWAY
1088-134318-0001 IT CARRIED HIM BACK A DOZEN YEARS TO A DIRTY LITTLE PEASANT'S CABIN ON THE HILLSIDE OUTSIDE DURAZZO TO THE LIVID FACE OF A YOUNG ALBANIAN CHIEF WHO HAD LOST AT KARA'S WHIM ALL THAT LIFE HELD FOR A MAN
1088-134318-0002 TO THE HATEFUL EYES OF THE GIRL'S FATHER WHO STOOD WITH FOLDED ARMS GLARING DOWN AT THE BOUND AND MANACLED FIGURE ON THE FLOOR TO THE SMOKE STAINED RAFTERS OF THIS PEASANT COTTAGE AND THE DANCING SHADOWS ON THE ROOF
1088-134318-0003 TO THAT TERRIBLE HOUR OF WAITING WHEN HE SAT BOUND TO A POST WITH A CANDLE FLICKERING AND SPLUTTERING LOWER AND LOWER TO THE LITTLE HEAP OF GUNPOWDER THAT WOULD START THE TRAIL TOWARD THE CLUMSY INFERNAL MACHINE UNDER HIS CHAIR
1088-134318-0004 HE REMEMBERED THE DAY WELL BECAUSE IT WAS CANDLEMAS DAY AND THIS WAS THE ANNIVERSARY HE REMEMBERED OTHER THINGS MORE PLEASANT
1088-134318-0005 HE REMEMBERED WITH A SAVAGE JOY THE SPECTACLE OF HIS WOULD BE ASSASSINS TWITCHING AND STRUGGLING ON THE GALLOWS AT PEZARA AND
1088-134318-0006 HAD T X RETURNED HE SLIPPED FROM THE BED AND WENT TO THE DOOR OPENED IT SLIGHTLY AND LISTENED T X WITH A SEARCH WARRANT MIGHT BE A SOURCE OF PANIC ESPECIALLY IF HE SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS HE HAD SATISFIED T X AND ALLAYED HIS SUSPICIONS
1088-134318-0007 KARA BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF AND HIS FACE WAS WREATHED IN SMILES WHY OF COURSE TELL HIM TO COME UP ASK HIM IF HE MINDS SEEING ME IN MY ROOM I TOLD HIM YOU WERE IN BED SIR AND HE USED SHOCKING LANGUAGE SAID FISHER KARA LAUGHED SEND HIM UP HE SAID
1088-134318-0008 YES SIR SAID THE SERVANT SUCH AN INSTRUCTION WAS REMARKABLY PLEASING TO HIM THERE WAS MUCH THAT HE HAD TO DO AND THAT NIGHT'S FREEDOM WOULD ASSIST HIM MATERIALLY PERHAPS KARA HESITATED PERHAPS YOU HAD BETTER WAIT UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK
1088-134318-0009 BRING ME UP SOME SANDWICHES AND A LARGE GLASS OF MILK OR BETTER STILL PLACE THEM ON A PLATE IN THE HALL VERY GOOD SIR SAID THE MAN AND WITHDREW DOWN BELOW THAT GROTESQUE FIGURE WITH HIS SHINY HAT AND HIS RAGGED BEARD WAS WALKING UP AND DOWN THE TESSELATED HALLWAY
1088-134318-0010 MUTTERING TO HIMSELF AND STARING AT THE VARIOUS OBJECTS IN THE HALL WITH A CERTAIN AMUSED ANTAGONISM MISTER KARA WILL SEE YOU SIR SAID FISHER OH SAID THE OTHER GLARING AT THE UNOFFENDING FISHER THAT'S VERY GOOD OF HIM
1088-134318-0011 YES SIR SAID FISHER LOOK HERE THE MAN THRUST OUT HIS FACE DO YOU SEE THOSE GREY HAIRS IN MY BEARD THE EMBARRASSED FISHER GRINNED IS IT GREY CHALLENGED THE VISITOR WITH A ROAR
1088-134318-0012 YES SIR SAID THE VALET HASTILY IS IT REAL GREY INSISTED THE VISITOR PULL ONE OUT AND SEE THE STARTLED FISHER DREW BACK WITH AN APOLOGETIC SMILE I COULDN'T THINK OF DOING A THING LIKE THAT SIR OH YOU COULDN'T SNEERED THE VISITOR
1088-134318-0013 THEN LEAD ON FISHER SHOWED THE WAY UP THE STAIRS THIS TIME THE TRAVELLER CARRIED NO BOOKS HIS LEFT ARM HUNG LIMPLY BY HIS SIDE AND FISHER PRIVATELY GATHERED THAT THE HAND HAD GOT LOOSE FROM THE DETAINING POCKET WITHOUT ITS OWNER BEING AWARE OF THE FACT
1088-134318-0014 HE PUSHED OPEN THE DOOR AND ANNOUNCED MISTER GATHERCOLE AND KARA CAME FORWARD WITH A SMILE TO MEET HIS AGENT WHO WITH TOP HAT STILL ON THE TOP OF HIS HEAD AND HIS OVERCOAT DANGLING ABOUT HIS HEELS MUST HAVE MADE A REMARKABLE PICTURE
1088-134318-0015 FISHER CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND THEM AND RETURNED TO HIS DUTIES IN THE HALL BELOW TEN MINUTES LATER HE HEARD THE DOOR OPENED AND THE BOOMING VOICE OF THE STRANGER CAME DOWN TO HIM FISHER WENT UP THE STAIRS TO MEET HIM AND FOUND HIM ADDRESSING THE OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM IN HIS OWN ECCENTRIC FASHION
1088-134318-0016 NO MORE PATAGONIA HE ROARED NO MORE TIERRA DEL FUEGO HE PAUSED CERTAINLY HE REPLIED TO SOME QUESTION BUT NOT PATAGONIA HE PAUSED AGAIN
1088-134318-0017 AND FISHER STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS WONDERED WHAT HAD OCCURRED TO MAKE THE VISITOR SO GENIAL I SUPPOSE YOUR CHEQUE WILL BE HONOURED ALL RIGHT ASKED THE VISITOR SARDONICALLY AND THEN BURST INTO A LITTLE CHUCKLE OF LAUGHTER AS HE CAREFULLY CLOSED THE DOOR
1088-134318-0018 DAMN ALL GREEKS HE SAID JOVIALLY AND FISHER COULD DO NO MORE THAN SMILE REPROACHFULLY THE SMILE BEING HIS VERY OWN THE REPROACH BEING ON BEHALF OF THE MASTER WHO PAID HIM THE TRAVELLER TOUCHED THE OTHER ON THE CHEST WITH HIS RIGHT HAND NEVER TRUST A GREEK HE SAID
1088-134318-0019 ALWAYS GET YOUR MONEY IN ADVANCE IS THAT CLEAR TO YOU YES SIR SAID FISHER BUT I THINK YOU WILL ALWAYS FIND THAT MISTER KARA IS ALWAYS MOST GENEROUS ABOUT MONEY DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT DON'T YOU BELIEVE IT MY POOR MAN SAID THE OTHER YOU
1088-134318-0020 AT THAT MOMENT THERE CAME FROM KARA'S ROOM A FAINT CLANG WHAT'S THAT ASKED THE VISITOR A LITTLE STARTLED MISTER KARA'S PUT DOWN HIS STEEL LATCH SAID FISHER WITH A SMILE WHICH MEANS THAT HE IS NOT TO BE DISTURBED UNTIL HE LOOKED AT HIS WATCH
1088-134318-0021 UNTIL ELEVEN O'CLOCK AT ANY RATE HE'S A FUNK SNAPPED THE OTHER A BEASTLY FUNK HE STAMPED DOWN THE STAIRS AS THOUGH TESTING THE WEIGHT OF EVERY TREAD OPENED THE FRONT DOOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE SLAMMED IT BEHIND HIM AND DISAPPEARED INTO THE NIGHT
1098-133695-0000 AS IF THE YOUNG LADY HAD BEEN IN A POSITION TO APPEAL TO IT BUT IN FACT THE BRITISH PUBLIC REMAINED FOR THE PRESENT PROFOUNDLY INDIFFERENT TO MISS ISABEL ARCHER WHOSE FORTUNE HAD DROPPED HER AS HER COUSIN SAID INTO THE DULLEST HOUSE IN ENGLAND
1098-133695-0001 HER GOUTY UNCLE RECEIVED VERY LITTLE COMPANY AND MISSUS TOUCHETT NOT HAVING CULTIVATED RELATIONS WITH HER HUSBAND'S NEIGHBOURS WAS NOT WARRANTED IN EXPECTING VISITS FROM THEM SHE HAD HOWEVER A PECULIAR TASTE SHE LIKED TO RECEIVE CARDS
1098-133695-0002 FOR WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED SOCIAL INTERCOURSE SHE HAD VERY LITTLE RELISH BUT NOTHING PLEASED HER MORE THAN TO FIND HER HALL TABLE WHITENED WITH OBLONG MORSELS OF SYMBOLIC PASTEBOARD SHE FLATTERED HERSELF THAT SHE WAS A VERY JUST WOMAN
1098-133695-0003 AND HAD MASTERED THE SOVEREIGN TRUTH THAT NOTHING IN THIS WORLD IS GOT FOR NOTHING SHE HAD PLAYED NO SOCIAL PART AS MISTRESS OF GARDENCOURT AND IT WAS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT IN THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY A MINUTE ACCOUNT SHOULD BE KEPT OF HER COMINGS AND GOINGS
1098-133695-0004 BUT IT IS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT SHE DID NOT FEEL IT TO BE WRONG THAT SO LITTLE NOTICE WAS TAKEN OF THEM AND THAT HER FAILURE REALLY VERY GRATUITOUS TO MAKE HERSELF IMPORTANT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD HAD NOT MUCH TO DO WITH THE ACRIMONY OF HER ALLUSIONS TO HER HUSBAND'S ADOPTED COUNTRY
1098-133695-0005 ISABEL PRESENTLY FOUND HERSELF IN THE SINGULAR SITUATION OF DEFENDING THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION AGAINST HER AUNT
1098-133695-0006 ISABEL ALWAYS FELT AN IMPULSE TO PULL OUT THE PINS NOT THAT SHE IMAGINED THEY INFLICTED ANY DAMAGE ON THE TOUGH OLD PARCHMENT BUT BECAUSE IT SEEMED TO HER HER AUNT MIGHT MAKE BETTER USE OF HER SHARPNESS
1098-133695-0007 SHE WAS VERY CRITICAL HERSELF IT WAS INCIDENTAL TO HER AGE HER SEX AND HER NATIONALITY BUT SHE WAS VERY SENTIMENTAL AS WELL AND THERE WAS SOMETHING IN MISSUS TOUCHETT'S DRYNESS THAT SET HER OWN MORAL FOUNTAINS FLOWING NOW WHAT'S YOUR POINT OF VIEW
1098-133695-0008 SHE ASKED OF HER AUNT WHEN YOU CRITICISE EVERYTHING HERE YOU SHOULD HAVE A POINT OF VIEW YOURS DOESN'T SEEM TO BE AMERICAN YOU THOUGHT EVERYTHING OVER THERE SO DISAGREEABLE WHEN I CRITICISE I HAVE MINE IT'S THOROUGHLY AMERICAN
1098-133695-0009 THERE ARE AS MANY POINTS OF VIEW IN THE WORLD AS THERE ARE PEOPLE OF SENSE TO TAKE THEM YOU MAY SAY THAT DOESN'T MAKE THEM VERY NUMEROUS AMERICAN NEVER IN THE WORLD THAT'S SHOCKINGLY NARROW MY POINT OF VIEW THANK GOD IS PERSONAL
1098-133695-0010 ISABEL THOUGHT THIS A BETTER ANSWER THAN SHE ADMITTED IT WAS A TOLERABLE DESCRIPTION OF HER OWN MANNER OF JUDGING BUT IT WOULD NOT HAVE SOUNDED WELL FOR HER TO SAY SO
1098-133695-0011 WOULD SAVOUR OF IMMODESTY EVEN OF ARROGANCE
1098-133695-0012 WITH WHOM SHE TALKED A GREAT DEAL AND WITH WHOM HER CONVERSATION WAS OF A SORT THAT GAVE A LARGE LICENCE TO EXTRAVAGANCE HER COUSIN USED AS THE PHRASE IS TO CHAFF HER
1098-133695-0013 HE VERY SOON ESTABLISHED WITH HER A REPUTATION FOR TREATING EVERYTHING AS A JOKE AND HE WAS NOT A MAN TO NEGLECT THE PRIVILEGES SUCH A REPUTATION CONFERRED
1098-133695-0014 OF LAUGHING AT ALL THINGS BEGINNING WITH HIMSELF SUCH SLENDER FACULTY OF REVERENCE AS HE POSSESSED CENTRED WHOLLY UPON HIS FATHER FOR THE REST HE EXERCISED HIS WIT INDIFFERENTLY UPON HIS FATHER'S SON THIS GENTLEMAN'S WEAK LUNGS
1098-133695-0015 HIS USELESS LIFE HIS FANTASTIC MOTHER
1098-133695-0016 HIS ADOPTED AND HIS NATIVE COUNTRY HIS CHARMING NEW FOUND COUSIN I KEEP A BAND OF MUSIC IN MY ANTE ROOM HE SAID ONCE TO HER IT HAS ORDERS TO PLAY WITHOUT STOPPING IT RENDERS ME TWO EXCELLENT SERVICES
1098-133695-0017 IT KEEPS THE SOUNDS OF THE WORLD FROM REACHING THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS AND IT MAKES THE WORLD THINK THAT DANCING'S GOING ON WITHIN
1098-133695-0018 THE LIVELIEST WALTZES SEEMED TO FLOAT UPON THE AIR ISABEL OFTEN FOUND HERSELF IRRITATED BY THIS PERPETUAL FIDDLING
1098-133695-0019 AND ENTER THE PRIVATE APARTMENTS IT MATTERED LITTLE THAT HE HAD ASSURED HER THEY WERE A VERY DISMAL PLACE SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN GLAD TO UNDERTAKE TO SWEEP THEM AND SET THEM IN ORDER IT WAS BUT HALF HOSPITALITY TO LET HER REMAIN OUTSIDE
1098-133695-0020 IT MUST BE SAID THAT HER WIT WAS EXERCISED TO A LARGE EXTENT IN SELF DEFENCE FOR HER COUSIN AMUSED HIMSELF WITH CALLING HER COLUMBIA AND ACCUSING HER OF A PATRIOTISM SO HEATED THAT IT SCORCHED HE DREW A CARICATURE OF HER
1098-133695-0021 IN THE FOLDS OF THE NATIONAL BANNER ISABEL'S CHIEF DREAD IN LIFE AT THIS PERIOD OF HER DEVELOPMENT WAS THAT SHE SHOULD APPEAR NARROW MINDED WHAT SHE FEARED NEXT AFTERWARDS WAS THAT SHE SHOULD REALLY BE SO BUT SHE NEVERTHELESS
1098-133695-0022 SHE WOULD BE AS AMERICAN AS IT PLEASED HIM TO REGARD HER AND IF HE CHOSE TO LAUGH AT HER SHE WOULD GIVE HIM PLENTY OF OCCUPATION SHE DEFENDED ENGLAND AGAINST HIS MOTHER BUT WHEN RALPH SANG ITS PRAISES ON PURPOSE AS SHE SAID TO WORK HER UP
1098-133695-0023 SHE FOUND HERSELF ABLE TO DIFFER FROM HIM ON A VARIETY OF POINTS IN FACT THE QUALITY OF THIS SMALL RIPE COUNTRY SEEMED AS SWEET TO HER AS THE TASTE OF AN OCTOBER PEAR
1098-133695-0024 AND HER SATISFACTION WAS AT THE ROOT OF THE GOOD SPIRITS WHICH ENABLED HER TO TAKE HER COUSIN'S CHAFF
1098-133695-0025 IF HER GOOD HUMOUR FLAGGED AT MOMENTS IT WAS NOT BECAUSE SHE THOUGHT HERSELF ILL USED BUT BECAUSE SHE SUDDENLY FELT SORRY FOR RALPH IT SEEMED TO HER HE WAS TALKING AS A BLIND AND HAD LITTLE HEART IN WHAT HE SAID
1098-133695-0026 I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU SHE OBSERVED TO HIM ONCE BUT I SUSPECT YOU'RE A GREAT HUMBUG THAT'S YOUR PRIVILEGE RALPH ANSWERED WHO HAD NOT BEEN USED TO BEING SO CRUDELY ADDRESSED I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU CARE FOR
1098-133695-0027 I DON'T THINK YOU CARE FOR ANYTHING YOU DON'T REALLY CARE FOR ENGLAND WHEN YOU PRAISE IT YOU DON'T CARE FOR AMERICA EVEN WHEN YOU PRETEND TO ABUSE IT I CARE FOR NOTHING BUT YOU DEAR COUSIN SAID RALPH IF I COULD BELIEVE
1098-133695-0028 EVEN THAT I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD AH WELL I SHOULD HOPE SO THE YOUNG MAN EXCLAIMED ISABEL MIGHT HAVE BELIEVED IT AND NOT HAVE BEEN FAR FROM THE TRUTH HE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL ABOUT HER SHE WAS CONSTANTLY PRESENT TO HIS MIND
1098-133695-0029 AT A TIME WHEN HIS THOUGHTS HAD BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF A BURDEN TO HIM HER SUDDEN ARRIVAL WHICH PROMISED NOTHING AND WAS AN OPEN HANDED GIFT OF FATE HAD REFRESHED AND QUICKENED THEM GIVEN THEM WINGS AND SOMETHING TO FLY FOR
1098-133695-0030 POOR RALPH HAD BEEN FOR MANY WEEKS STEEPED IN MELANCHOLY HIS OUTLOOK HABITUALLY SOMBRE LAY UNDER THE SHADOW OF A DEEPER CLOUD
1098-133695-0031 THE OLD MAN HAD BEEN GRAVELY ILL IN THE SPRING AND THE DOCTORS HAD WHISPERED TO RALPH THAT ANOTHER ATTACK WOULD BE LESS EASY TO DEAL WITH JUST NOW HE APPEARED DISBURDENED OF PAIN BUT RALPH COULD NOT RID HIMSELF OF A SUSPICION THAT THIS WAS A SUBTERFUGE OF THE ENEMY
1098-133695-0032 WHO WAS WAITING TO TAKE HIM OFF HIS GUARD IF THE MANOEUVRE SHOULD SUCCEED THERE WOULD BE LITTLE HOPE OF ANY GREAT RESISTANCE RALPH HAD ALWAYS TAKEN FOR GRANTED THAT HIS FATHER WOULD SURVIVE HIM THAT HIS OWN NAME WOULD BE THE FIRST GRIMLY CALLED
1098-133695-0033 THE FATHER AND SON HAD BEEN CLOSE COMPANIONS AND THE IDEA OF BEING LEFT ALONE WITH THE REMNANT OF A TASTELESS LIFE ON HIS HANDS WAS NOT GRATIFYING TO THE YOUNG MAN WHO HAD ALWAYS AND TACITLY COUNTED UPON HIS ELDER'S HELP IN MAKING THE BEST OF A POOR BUSINESS
1098-133695-0034 AT THE PROSPECT OF LOSING HIS GREAT MOTIVE RALPH LOST INDEED HIS ONE INSPIRATION
1098-133695-0035 BUT WITHOUT THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF HIS FATHER'S SOCIETY HE SHOULD BARELY HAVE PATIENCE TO AWAIT HIS OWN TURN HE HAD NOT THE INCENTIVE OF FEELING THAT HE WAS INDISPENSABLE TO HIS MOTHER IT WAS A RULE WITH HIS MOTHER TO HAVE NO REGRETS
1098-133695-0036 HE BETHOUGHT HIMSELF OF COURSE THAT IT HAD BEEN A SMALL KINDNESS TO HIS FATHER TO WISH THAT OF THE TWO THE ACTIVE RATHER THAN THE PASSIVE PARTY SHOULD KNOW THE FELT WOUND HE REMEMBERED THAT THE OLD MAN HAD ALWAYS TREATED HIS OWN FORECAST OF AN EARLY END AS A CLEVER FALLACY
1098-133695-0037 WHICH HE SHOULD BE DELIGHTED TO DISCREDIT SO FAR AS HE MIGHT BY DYING FIRST BUT OF THE TWO TRIUMPHS THAT OF REFUTING A SOPHISTICAL SON AND THAT OF HOLDING ON A WHILE LONGER TO A STATE OF BEING WHICH WITH ALL ABATEMENTS HE ENJOYED
1098-133695-0038 HE WONDERED WHETHER HE WERE HARBOURING LOVE FOR THIS SPONTANEOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY BUT HE JUDGED THAT ON THE WHOLE HE WAS NOT AFTER HE HAD KNOWN HER FOR A WEEK HE QUITE MADE UP HIS MIND TO THIS AND EVERY DAY HE FELT A LITTLE MORE SURE
1098-133695-0039 LORD WARBURTON HAD BEEN RIGHT ABOUT HER SHE WAS A REALLY INTERESTING LITTLE FIGURE RALPH WONDERED HOW THEIR NEIGHBOUR HAD FOUND IT OUT SO SOON AND THEN HE SAID IT WAS ONLY ANOTHER PROOF OF HIS FRIEND'S HIGH ABILITIES
1098-133695-0040 WHICH HE HAD ALWAYS GREATLY ADMIRED IF HIS COUSIN WERE TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN AN ENTERTAINMENT TO HIM RALPH WAS CONSCIOUS SHE WAS AN ENTERTAINMENT OF A HIGH ORDER A CHARACTER LIKE THAT HE SAID TO HIMSELF
1098-133695-0041 A REAL LITTLE PASSIONATE FORCE TO SEE AT PLAY IS THE FINEST THING IN NATURE IT'S FINER THAN THE FINEST WORK OF ART THAN A GREEK BAS RELIEF
1098-133695-0042 THAN A GOTHIC CATHEDRAL IT'S VERY PLEASANT TO BE SO WELL TREATED WHERE ONE HAD LEAST LOOKED FOR IT I HAD NEVER BEEN MORE BLUE MORE BORED THAN FOR A WEEK BEFORE SHE CAME I HAD NEVER EXPECTED LESS THAT ANYTHING PLEASANT WOULD HAPPEN
1098-133695-0043 A GREEK BAS RELIEF TO STICK OVER MY CHIMNEY PIECE THE KEY OF A BEAUTIFUL EDIFICE IS THRUST INTO MY HAND AND I'M TOLD TO WALK IN AND ADMIRE MY POOR BOY YOU'VE BEEN SADLY UNGRATEFUL
1098-133695-0044 AND NOW YOU HAD BETTER KEEP VERY QUIET AND NEVER GRUMBLE AGAIN THE SENTIMENT OF THESE REFLEXIONS WAS VERY JUST
1098-133695-0045 HIS COUSIN WAS A VERY BRILLIANT GIRL
1098-133695-0046 BUT SHE NEEDED THE KNOWING AND HIS ATTITUDE WITH REGARD TO HER THOUGH IT WAS CONTEMPLATIVE AND CRITICAL WAS NOT JUDICIAL HE SURVEYED THE EDIFICE FROM THE OUTSIDE AND ADMIRED IT GREATLY
1098-133695-0047 ISABEL'S ORIGINALITY WAS THAT SHE GAVE ONE AN IMPRESSION OF HAVING INTENTIONS OF HER OWN WHENEVER SHE EXECUTES THEM SAID RALPH MAY I BE THERE TO SEE IT DEVOLVED UPON HIM OF COURSE TO DO THE HONOURS OF THE PLACE
1098-133695-0048 AND HIS WIFE'S POSITION WAS THAT OF RATHER A GRIM VISITOR SO THAT IN THE LINE OF CONDUCT THAT OPENED ITSELF TO RALPH DUTY AND INCLINATION WERE HARMONIOUSLY MIXED HE WAS NOT A GREAT WALKER BUT HE STROLLED ABOUT THE GROUNDS WITH HIS COUSIN
1098-133695-0049 A PASTIME FOR WHICH THE WEATHER REMAINED FAVOURABLE WITH A PERSISTENCY NOT ALLOWED FOR IN ISABEL'S SOMEWHAT LUGUBRIOUS PREVISION OF THE CLIMATE AND IN THE LONG AFTERNOONS OF WHICH THE LENGTH WAS BUT THE MEASURE OF HER GRATIFIED EAGERNESS
1098-133695-0050 THEY TOOK A BOAT ON THE RIVER THE DEAR LITTLE RIVER AS ISABEL CALLED IT WHERE THE OPPOSITE SHORE SEEMED STILL A PART OF THE FOREGROUND OF THE LANDSCAPE OR DROVE OVER THE COUNTRY IN A PHAETON A LOW CAPACIOUS THICK WHEELED PHAETON
1098-133695-0051 BUT WHICH HE HAD NOW CEASED TO ENJOY ISABEL ENJOYED IT LARGELY AND HANDLING THE REINS IN A MANNER WHICH APPROVED ITSELF TO THE GROOM AS KNOWING WAS NEVER WEARY OF DRIVING HER UNCLE'S CAPITAL HORSES THROUGH WINDING LANES AND BYWAYS
1098-133695-0052 FULL OF THE RURAL INCIDENTS SHE HAD CONFIDENTLY EXPECTED TO FIND PAST COTTAGES THATCHED AND TIMBERED PAST ALE HOUSES LATTICED AND SANDED PAST PATCHES OF ANCIENT COMMON AND GLIMPSES OF EMPTY PARKS
1098-133695-0053 BETWEEN HEDGEROWS MADE THICK BY MIDSUMMER WHEN THEY REACHED HOME THEY USUALLY FOUND TEA HAD BEEN SERVED ON THE LAWN
1098-133695-0054 BUT THE TWO FOR THE MOST PART SAT SILENT THE OLD MAN WITH HIS HEAD BACK AND HIS EYES CLOSED HIS WIFE OCCUPIED WITH HER KNITTING AND WEARING THAT APPEARANCE OF RARE PROFUNDITY WITH WHICH SOME LADIES CONSIDER THE MOVEMENT OF THEIR NEEDLES
1098-133695-0055 ONE DAY HOWEVER A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED THE TWO YOUNG PERSONS AFTER SPENDING AN HOUR ON THE RIVER STROLLED BACK TO THE HOUSE AND PERCEIVED LORD WARBURTON SITTING UNDER THE TREES AND ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION
1098-133695-0056 OF WHICH EVEN AT A DISTANCE THE DESULTORY CHARACTER WAS APPRECIABLE WITH
1098-133695-0057 HE HAD DRIVEN OVER FROM HIS OWN PLACE WITH A PORTMANTEAU AND HAD ASKED AS THE FATHER AND SON OFTEN INVITED HIM TO DO FOR A DINNER AND A LODGING ISABEL SEEING HIM FOR HALF AN HOUR ON THE DAY OF HER ARRIVAL HAD DISCOVERED IN THIS BRIEF SPACE THAT SHE LIKED HIM
1098-133695-0058 HE HAD INDEED RATHER SHARPLY REGISTERED HIMSELF ON HER FINE SENSE AND SHE HAD THOUGHT OF HIM SEVERAL TIMES SHE HAD HOPED SHE SHOULD SEE HIM AGAIN HOPED TOO THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A FEW OTHERS GARDENCOURT WAS NOT DULL
1098-133695-0059 THE PLACE ITSELF WAS SOVEREIGN HER UNCLE WAS MORE AND MORE A SORT OF GOLDEN GRANDFATHER AND RALPH WAS UNLIKE ANY COUSIN SHE HAD EVER ENCOUNTERED HER IDEA OF COUSINS HAVING TENDED TO GLOOM THEN
1098-133695-0060 HER IMPRESSIONS WERE STILL SO FRESH AND SO QUICKLY RENEWED THAT THERE WAS AS YET HARDLY A HINT OF VACANCY IN THE VIEW BUT ISABEL HAD NEED TO REMIND HERSELF THAT SHE WAS INTERESTED IN HUMAN NATURE AND THAT HER FOREMOST HOPE IN COMING ABROAD
1098-133695-0061 HAD BEEN THAT SHE SHOULD SEE A GREAT MANY PEOPLE WHEN RALPH SAID TO HER AS HE HAD DONE SEVERAL TIMES I WONDER YOU FIND THIS ENDURABLE YOU OUGHT TO SEE SOME OF THE NEIGHBOURS AND SOME OF OUR FRIENDS
1098-133695-0062 THOUGH YOU WOULD NEVER SUPPOSE IT WHEN HE OFFERED TO INVITE WHAT HE CALLED A LOT OF PEOPLE AND MAKE HER ACQUAINTED WITH ENGLISH SOCIETY SHE ENCOURAGED THE HOSPITABLE IMPULSE AND PROMISED IN ADVANCE TO HURL HERSELF INTO THE FRAY
1098-133695-0063 LITTLE HOWEVER FOR THE PRESENT HAD COME OF HIS OFFERS AND IT MAY BE CONFIDED TO THE READER THAT IF THE YOUNG MAN DELAYED TO CARRY THEM OUT IT WAS BECAUSE HE FOUND THE LABOUR OF PROVIDING FOR HIS COMPANION BY NO MEANS SO SEVERE AS TO REQUIRE EXTRANEOUS HELP
1098-133695-0064 ISABEL HAD SPOKEN TO HIM VERY OFTEN ABOUT SPECIMENS IT WAS A WORD THAT PLAYED A CONSIDERABLE PART IN HER VOCABULARY SHE HAD GIVEN HIM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WISHED TO SEE ENGLISH SOCIETY ILLUSTRATED BY EMINENT CASES
1098-133695-0065 WELL NOW THERE'S A SPECIMEN HE SAID TO HER AS THEY WALKED UP FROM THE RIVERSIDE AND HE RECOGNISED LORD WARBURTON A SPECIMEN OF WHAT ASKED THE GIRL A SPECIMEN OF AN ENGLISH GENTLEMAN DO YOU MEAN THEY'RE ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0066 OH NO THEY'RE NOT ALL LIKE HIM
1098-133695-0067 SAID ISABEL BECAUSE I'M SURE HE'S NICE
1098-133695-0068 THE FORTUNATE LORD WARBURTON EXCHANGED A HANDSHAKE WITH OUR HEROINE AND HOPED SHE WAS VERY WELL BUT I NEEDN'T ASK THAT HE SAID SINCE YOU'VE BEEN HANDLING THE OARS I'VE BEEN ROWING A LITTLE ISABEL ANSWERED BUT HOW SHOULD YOU KNOW IT
1098-133695-0069 OH I KNOW HE DOESN'T ROW HE'S TOO LAZY SAID HIS LORDSHIP INDICATING RALPH TOUCHETT WITH A LAUGH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR HIS LAZINESS ISABEL REJOINED LOWERING HER VOICE A LITTLE AH HE HAS A GOOD EXCUSE FOR EVERYTHING
1098-133695-0070 CRIED LORD WARBURTON STILL WITH HIS SONOROUS MIRTH MY EXCUSE FOR NOT ROWING IS THAT MY COUSIN ROWS SO WELL SAID RALPH SHE DOES EVERYTHING WELL SHE TOUCHES NOTHING THAT SHE DOESN'T ADORN
1098-133695-0071 IT MAKES ONE WANT TO BE TOUCHED MISS ARCHER LORD WARBURTON DECLARED
1098-133695-0072 WHO IF IT PLEASED HER TO HEAR IT SAID THAT HER ACCOMPLISHMENTS WERE NUMEROUS WAS HAPPILY ABLE TO REFLECT THAT SUCH COMPLACENCY WAS NOT THE INDICATION OF A FEEBLE MIND INASMUCH AS THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS IN WHICH SHE EXCELLED
1098-133695-0073 HAD AT LEAST THE ELEMENT OF HUMILITY THAT IT ALWAYS NEEDED TO BE SUPPORTED BY PROOF LORD WARBURTON NOT ONLY SPENT THE NIGHT AT GARDENCOURT BUT HE WAS PERSUADED TO REMAIN OVER THE SECOND DAY AND WHEN THE SECOND DAY WAS ENDED
1098-133695-0074 HE DETERMINED TO POSTPONE HIS DEPARTURE TILL THE MORROW DURING THIS PERIOD HE ADDRESSED MANY OF HIS REMARKS TO ISABEL WHO ACCEPTED THIS EVIDENCE OF HIS ESTEEM WITH A VERY GOOD GRACE SHE FOUND HERSELF LIKING HIM EXTREMELY
1098-133695-0075 THE FIRST IMPRESSION HE HAD MADE ON HER HAD HAD WEIGHT BUT AT THE END OF AN EVENING SPENT IN HIS SOCIETY SHE SCARCE FELL SHORT OF SEEING HIM THOUGH QUITE WITHOUT LURIDITY AS A HERO OF ROMANCE
1098-133695-0076 WITH A QUICKENED CONSCIOUSNESS OF POSSIBLE FELICITIES IT'S VERY NICE TO KNOW TWO SUCH CHARMING PEOPLE AS THOSE SHE SAID MEANING BY THOSE HER COUSIN AND HER COUSIN'S FRIEND IT MUST BE ADDED MOREOVER
1098-133695-0077 THAT AN INCIDENT HAD OCCURRED WHICH MIGHT HAVE SEEMED TO PUT HER GOOD HUMOUR TO THE TEST

1098-133695-0086 MISSUS TOUCHETT GAVE A LITTLE LOOK OF DESPAIR AND SAT DOWN AGAIN
1098-133695-0087 RALPH MEANWHILE HANDED ISABEL HER CANDLESTICK HE HAD BEEN WATCHING HER IT HAD SEEMED TO HIM HER TEMPER WAS INVOLVED AN ACCIDENT THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTING BUT IF HE HAD EXPECTED ANYTHING OF A FLARE HE WAS DISAPPOINTED FOR THE GIRL SIMPLY LAUGHED A LITTLE

1116-132847-0000 AND A GIRL CALLED BELLAH POSTIK THEY WERE COUSINS AND AS THEIR MOTHERS WERE GREAT FRIENDS AND CONSTANTLY IN AND OUT OF EACH OTHER'S HOUSES THEY HAD OFTEN BEEN LAID IN THE SAME CRADLE AND HAD PLAYED AND FOUGHT OVER THEIR GAMES WHEN THEY ARE GROWN UP THEY WILL MARRY SAID THE MOTHERS
1116-132847-0001 AND SOON THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN HEARD BEWAILING TO EACH OTHER THE HARDNESS OF THEIR LOTS
1116-132847-0002 I WOULD RENT A BIT OF GROUND FROM THE MASTER AND THEN WE COULD BE MARRIED YES ANSWERED BELLAH WITH A DEEP SIGH BUT WE LIVE IN SUCH HARD TIMES AND AT THE LAST FAIR THE PRICE OF PIGS HAD RISEN AGAIN WE SHALL HAVE LONG TO WAIT
1116-132847-0003 THAT IS QUITE CLEAR REPLIED HOUARN TURNING AWAY TO HIS WORK WHENEVER THEY MET THEY REPEATED THEIR GRIEVANCES AND AT LENGTH HOUARN'S PATIENCE WAS EXHAUSTED AND ONE MORNING HE CAME TO BELLAH AND TOLD HER THAT HE WAS GOING AWAY TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE
1116-132847-0004 THE GIRL WAS VERY UNHAPPY AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS AND FELT SORRY THAT SHE HAD NOT TRIED TO MAKE THE BEST OF THINGS SHE IMPLORED HOUARN NOT TO LEAVE HER BUT HE WOULD LISTEN TO NOTHING THE BIRDS HE SAID CONTINUE FLYING UNTIL THEY REACH A FIELD OF CORN AND
1116-132847-0005 LIKE THEM I SHALL SEEK TILL I GET WHAT I WANT THAT IS MONEY TO BUY A COW AND A PIG TO FATTEN AND IF YOU LOVE ME BELLAH YOU WON'T ATTEMPT TO HINDER A PLAN WHICH WILL HASTEN OUR MARRIAGE THE GIRL SAW IT WAS USELESS TO SAY MORE SO SHE ANSWERED SADLY
1116-132847-0006 WELL GO THEN SINCE YOU MUST BUT FIRST I WILL DIVIDE WITH YOU ALL THAT MY PARENTS LEFT ME AND GOING TO HER ROOM SHE OPENED A SMALL CHEST AND TOOK FROM IT A BELL A KNIFE AND A LITTLE STICK THIS BELL SHE SAID CAN BE HEARD AT ANY DISTANCE HOWEVER FAR
1116-132847-0007 BUT IT ONLY RINGS TO WARN US THAT OUR FRIENDS ARE IN GREAT DANGER THE KNIFE FREES ALL IT TOUCHES FROM THE SPELLS THAT HAVE BEEN LAID ON THEM WHILE THE STICK WILL CARRY YOU WHEREVER YOU WANT TO GO I WILL GIVE YOU THE KNIFE TO GUARD YOU AGAINST THE ENCHANTMENTS OF WIZARDS
1116-132847-0008 AND THE BELL TO TELL ME OF YOUR PERILS THE STICK I SHALL KEEP FOR MYSELF SO THAT I CAN FLY TO YOU IF EVER YOU HAVE NEED OF ME THEN THEY CRIED FOR A LITTLE ON EACH OTHER'S NECKS AND HOUARN STARTED FOR THE MOUNTAINS BUT IN THOSE DAYS AS IN THESE BEGGARS ABOUNDED
1116-132847-0009 AND THROUGH EVERY VILLAGE HE PASSED THEY FOLLOWED HOUARN IN CROWDS MISTAKING HIM FOR A GENTLEMAN BECAUSE THERE WERE NO HOLES IN HIS CLOTHES THERE IS NO FORTUNE TO BE MADE HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF IT IS A PLACE FOR SPENDING AND NOT EARNING I SEE I MUST GO FURTHER
1116-132847-0010 AND HE WALKED ON TO PONT AVEN A PRETTY LITTLE TOWN BUILT ON THE BANK OF A RIVER HE WAS SITTING ON A BENCH OUTSIDE AN INN
1116-132847-0011 AND THE MEN ANSWERED THAT IT WAS THE NAME GIVEN TO THE FAIRY THAT DWELT IN THE LAKE
1116-132847-0012 AND BESOUGHT HIM NOT TO BE SO MAD AND TO THROW AWAY HIS LIFE IN SUCH A FOOLISH MANNER BUT HE ONLY LAUGHED
1116-132847-0013 BUT THE MEN DID NOT KNOW HOW THIS WAS TO BE DONE AND SHAKING THEIR HEADS OVER HIS OBSTINACY LEFT HIM TO HIS FATE
1116-132847-0014 THE ISLAND WAS LARGE AND LYING ALMOST ACROSS IT WAS A LAKE WITH A NARROW OPENING TO THE SEA HOUARN PAID THE BOATMAN AND SENT HIM AWAY AND THEN PROCEEDED TO WALK ROUND THE LAKE
1116-132847-0015 AS SOON AS THE YOUNG MAN HAD RECOVERED FROM HIS SURPRISE HE PREPARED TO JUMP INTO THE LAKE AND SWIM TO SHORE BUT THE BIRD HAD GUESSED HIS INTENTIONS AND PLUNGED BENEATH THE WATER
1116-132847-0016 THE PINK AND WHITE OF HER FACE REMINDED YOU OF THE SHELLS OF HER PALACE WHILE HER LONG BLACK HAIR WAS INTERTWINED WITH STRINGS OF CORAL AND HER DRESS OF GREEN SILK SEEMED FORMED OUT OF THE SEA AT THE SIGHT OF HER HOUARN STOPPED DAZZLED BY HER BEAUTY
1116-132847-0017 MY NAME IS HOUARN HE ANSWERED
1116-132847-0018 AND SHE BECKONED HIM TO FOLLOW HER INTO A SECOND HALL WHOSE FLOORS AND WALLS WERE FORMED OF PEARLS WHILE DOWN THE SIDES THERE WERE TABLES LADEN WITH FRUIT AND WINES OF ALL KINDS
1116-132847-0019 CAME FROM SHIPWRECKED VESSELS AND WERE BROUGHT TO HER PALACE BY A MAGIC CURRENT OF WATER I DO NOT WONDER EXCLAIMED HOUARN WHO NOW FELT QUITE AT HOME DO NOT WONDER THAT THE PEOPLE ON THE EARTH HAVE SO MUCH TO SAY ABOUT YOU THE RICH ARE ALWAYS ENVIED
1116-132847-0020 THE YOUNG MAN GAZED AT HER IN SURPRISE COULD ANY ONE SO RICH AND SO BEAUTIFUL REALLY WISH TO BE HIS WIFE HE LOOKED AT HER AGAIN AND BELLAH WAS FORGOTTEN AS HE ANSWERED A MAN WOULD BE MAD INDEED TO REFUSE SUCH AN OFFER I CAN ONLY ACCEPT IT WITH JOY
1116-132847-0021 WHEN IT WAS FULL SHE WENT INTO A LARGE KITCHEN AND THREW THEM ALL INTO A GOLDEN POT
1116-132847-0022 BUT IT DID NOT SOUND THE LEAST LIKE THAT TO HOUARN THERE IT IS AGAIN HE SAID AFTER A SHORT PAUSE
1116-132847-0023 JUMP SHE REPLIED BUT SOON THE NOISE GREW LOUDER AND LIKE CRIES WHAT IS IT ASKED HOUARN BEGINNING TO FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE JUST THE CRICKETS ON THE HEARTH SAID SHE AND BROKE INTO A SONG WHICH DROWNED THE CRIES FROM THE POT
1116-132847-0024 BUT THOUGH HOUARN HELD HIS PEACE HE WAS NOT AS HAPPY AS BEFORE SOMETHING SEEMED TO HAVE GONE WRONG AND THEN HE SUDDENLY REMEMBERED BELLAH IS IT POSSIBLE I CAN HAVE FORGOTTEN HER SO SOON
1116-132847-0025 AND FOUR MEN STOOD BEFORE HIM HOUARN SAVE US WE ENTREAT YOU AND SAVE YOURSELF TOO MURMURED THEY NOT DARING TO RAISE THEIR VOICES
1116-132847-0026 AND NO SOONER WAS THE CEREMONY OVER THAN SHE TURNED US INTO FISHES AS SHE HAD DONE TO ALL OUR FORERUNNERS WHO ARE IN THE FISH POND STILL WHERE YOU WILL SHORTLY JOIN THEM
1116-132847-0027 IT WAS AT THIS VERY MOMENT THAT BELLAH WHO WAS SKIMMING THE MILK IN THE FARM DAIRY HEARD THE FAIRY BELL TINKLE VIOLENTLY AT THE SOUND SHE GREW PALE FOR SHE KNEW IT MEANT THAT HOUARN WAS IN DANGER
1116-132847-0028 LITTLE STAFF OF APPLE TREE OVER THE EARTH AND OVER THE SEA UP IN THE AIR BE GUIDE TO ME EVERYWHERE TO WANDER FREE AND IMMEDIATELY THE STICK BECAME A SMART LITTLE HORSE WITH A ROSETTE AT EACH EAR AND A FEATHER ON HIS FOREHEAD HE STOOD QUITE STILL
1116-132847-0029 THE SWALLOW IS LESS SWIFT THAN THE WIND THE WIND IS LESS SWIFT THAN THE LIGHTNING BUT YOU MY HORSE IF YOU LOVE ME MUST BE SWIFTER THAN THEM ALL FOR THERE IS A PART OF MY HEART THAT SUFFERS THE BEST PART OF MY HEART THAT IS IN DANGER AND THE HORSE HEARD HER
1116-132847-0030 AND GALLOPED LIKE A STRAW CARRIED ALONG BY A TEMPEST TILL THEY REACHED THE FOOT OF A ROCK CALLED THE LEAP OF THE DEER
1116-132847-0031 TO SAVE YOU REPEATED BELLAH BUT WHO ARE YOU MY LITTLE FRIEND
1116-132847-0032 AND IT IS OWING TO HER THAT I AM HERE BUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS NEST I AM SITTING ON SIX EGGS OF STONE AND I SHALL NOT BE SET FREE TILL THEY ARE HATCHED
1116-132847-0033 WHEN YOU HAVE FOUND HER YOU MUST CONTRIVE TO GET HOLD OF THE NET OF STEEL THAT HANGS FROM HER WAIST AND SHUT HER UP IN IT FOR EVER BUT WHERE AM I TO FIND A YOUNG MAN'S CLOTHES ASKED SHE I WILL SHOW YOU HE REPLIED
1116-132847-0034 AND THE FOURTH AN IRON WITHOUT WAITING FOR ORDERS THEY SAT DOWN IN THE NEST AND CROSSING THEIR LEGS COMFORTABLY BEGAN TO PREPARE THE SUIT OF CLOTHES FOR BELLAH WITH ONE OF THE LEAVES OF THE CABBAGE THEY MADE HER A COAT
1116-132847-0035 AND WITH IT IN HER HAND SHE STEPPED INTO THE BLUE BOAT WHICH CONDUCTED HER TO THE PALACE OF SHELLS THE GROAC'H SEEMED OVERJOYED TO SEE HER AND TOLD HER THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD SHE BEHELD SUCH A HANDSOME YOUNG MAN
1116-132847-0036 VERY SOON SHE LED HER VISITOR INTO THE GREAT HALL WHERE WINE AND FRUIT WERE ALWAYS WAITING AND ON THE TABLE LAY THE MAGIC KNIFE LEFT THERE BY HOUARN
1116-132847-0037 AND TO THE POND WHICH CONTAINED THE FISH THEIR SIDES SHINING WITH A THOUSAND DIFFERENT COLOURS
1116-132847-0038 AND TURNING RAPIDLY FLUNG IT OVER THE WITCH'S HEAD BECOME IN BODY WHAT YOU ARE IN SOUL CRIED SHE AND IN AN INSTANT THE LOVELY FAIRY OF THE SEA WAS A TOAD HORRIBLE TO LOOK UPON SHE STRUGGLED HARD TO TEAR THE NET ASUNDER BUT IT WAS NO USE
1116-132847-0039 HER EYES FELL ON A GREEN FROG ON HIS KNEES BESIDE HER HIS LITTLE PAWS CROSSED OVER HIS LITTLE HEART BELLAH FELT AS IF FINGERS WERE TIGHTENING ROUND HER THROAT BUT SHE MANAGED TO CRY IS THIS YOU MY HOUARN IS THIS YOU IT IS I CROAKED THE LITTLE FROG
1116-132847-0040 IN A CAR DRAWN BY SIX COCKCHAFERS WHICH ONCE HAD BEEN THE SIX STONE EGGS HERE I AM HE EXCLAIMED YOU HAVE BROKEN THE SPELL THAT HELD ME AND NOW COME AND GET YOUR REWARD AND DISMOUNTING FROM HIS CHARIOT HE LED THEM DOWN INTO THE CAVES FILLED WITH GOLD AND JEWELS
1116-132851-0000 AND SHOES WITH SILVER BUCKLES THE WOMEN WERE ALL FILLED WITH ENVY BUT LITTLE CARED BARBAIK WHAT THEY MIGHT WHISPER BEHIND HER BACK AS LONG AS SHE KNEW THAT HER CLOTHES WERE FINER THAN ANYONE ELSE'S AND THAT SHE HAD MORE PARTNERS THAN ANY OTHER GIRL
1116-132851-0001 AND WHAT WAS WORSE OFTEN MADE FUN OF HIM WITH THE REST
1116-132851-0002 ONE EVENING HE WAS BRINGING BACK HIS HORSES FROM THE FIELDS AND STOPPED AT A LITTLE LAKE ON THE WAY HOME TO LET THEM DRINK HE WAS TIRED WITH A LONG DAY'S WORK AND STOOD WITH HIS HAND ON THE MANE OF ONE OF THE ANIMALS WAITING TILL THEY HAD DONE AND THINKING ALL THE WHILE OF BARBAIK
1116-132851-0003 WHEN A VOICE CAME OUT OF THE GORSE CLOSE BY
1116-132851-0004 IT IS I THE BROWNIE OF THE LAKE REPLIED THE VOICE BUT WHERE ARE YOU INQUIRED JEGU LOOK CLOSE AND YOU WILL SEE ME AMONG THE REEDS IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE GREEN FROG I CAN TAKE HE ADDED PROUDLY ANY SHAPE I CHOOSE
1116-132851-0005 AND EVEN WHICH IS MUCH HARDER BE INVISIBLE IF I WANT TO THEN SHOW YOURSELF TO ME IN THE SHAPE IN WHICH YOUR FAMILY GENERALLY APPEAR REPLIED JEGU CERTAINLY IF YOU WISH AND THE FROG JUMPED ON THE BACK OF ONE OF THE HORSES AND CHANGED INTO A LITTLE DWARF ALL DRESSED IN GREEN
1116-132851-0006 AT FIRST UNDER DIFFERENT ANIMAL SHAPES SINCE THAT TIME PARTLY FROM HABIT AND PARTLY TO AMUSE OURSELVES WE HAVE CONTINUED TO TRANSFORM OURSELVES AND IT WAS IN THIS WAY THAT I GOT TO KNOW YOU HOW EXCLAIMED JEGU FILLED WITH ASTONISHMENT
1116-132851-0007 BUT HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT EXCLAIMED JEGU WONDERINGLY THAT IS MY AFFAIR PERHAPS I MAY TELL YOU LATER MEANWHILE YOU JUST EAT AND SLEEP AND DON'T WORRY YOURSELF ABOUT ANYTHING
1116-132851-0008 JEGU DECLARED THAT NOTHING COULD BE EASIER AND THEN TAKING OFF HIS HAT HE THANKED THE DWARF HEARTILY AND LED HIS HORSES BACK TO THE FARM NEXT MORNING WAS A HOLIDAY AND BARBAIK WAS AWAKE EARLIER THAN USUAL
1116-132851-0009 AS SHE WISHED TO GET THROUGH HER WORK AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND BE READY TO START FOR A DANCE WHICH WAS TO BE HELD SOME DISTANCE OFF SHE WENT FIRST TO THE COW HOUSE WHICH IT WAS HER DUTY TO KEEP CLEAN BUT TO HER AMAZEMENT SHE FOUND FRESH STRAW PUT DOWN
1116-132851-0010 THE RACKS FILLED WITH HAY THE COWS MILKED AND THE PAILS STANDING NEATLY IN A ROW
1116-132851-0011 AND WHEN SHE MET HIM OUTSIDE THE DOOR SHE STOPPED AND THANKED HIM FOR HIS HELP TO BE SURE JEGU ONLY REPLIED ROUGHLY THAT HE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT BUT THIS ANSWER MADE HER FEEL ALL THE MORE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS HE AND NOBODY ELSE
1116-132851-0012 INDEED BARBAIK HAD ONLY TO EXPRESS A WISH FOR IT TO BE SATISFIED IF THE WIND WAS COLD OR THE SUN WAS HOT AND SHE WAS AFRAID TO GO OUT LEST HER COMPLEXION SHOULD BE SPOILT SHE NEED ONLY TO RUN DOWN TO THE SPRING CLOSE BY AND SAY SOFTLY I SHOULD LIKE MY CHURNS TO BE FULL
1116-132851-0013 AND MY WET LINEN TO BE STRETCHED ON THE HEDGE TO DRY AND SHE NEED NEVER GIVE ANOTHER THOUGHT TO THE MATTER IF SHE FOUND THE RYE BREAD TOO HARD TO BAKE OR THE OVEN TAKING TOO LONG TO HEAT SHE JUST MURMURED I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE MY SIX LOAVES ON THE SHELF ABOVE THE BREAD BOX
1116-132851-0014 WHY AM I NOT ALREADY BACK FROM MORLAIX WITH MY MILK POT EMPTY MY BUTTER BOWL INSIDE IT A POUND OF WILD CHERRIES ON MY WOODEN PLATE AND THE MONEY I HAVE GAINED IN MY APRON POCKET AND IN THE MORNING WHEN SHE GOT UP LO AND BEHOLD
1116-132851-0015 AND SIX NEW PIECES OF SILVER IN THE POCKET OF HER APRON AND SHE BELIEVED THAT ALL THIS WAS OWING TO JEGU AND SHE COULD NO LONGER DO WITHOUT HIM EVEN IN HER THOUGHTS WHEN THINGS HAD REACHED THIS PASS THE BROWNIE TOLD THE YOUNG MAN THAT HE HAD BETTER ASK BARBAIK TO MARRY HIM
1116-132851-0016 AND THIS TIME THE GIRL DID NOT TURN RUDELY AWAY BUT LISTENED PATIENTLY TO THE END
1116-132851-0017 AND SHE COULD SLEEP EVERY MORNING TILL BREAKFAST TIME JUST LIKE A YOUNG LADY AND AS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY
1116-132851-0018 SHE WOULD WEAR THE BEAUTIFUL DRESSES THAT CAME WHEN SHE WISHED FOR THEM
1116-132851-0019 BARBAIK WAS FURIOUS
1116-132851-0020 HER HEART WAS FILLED WITH RAGE AGAINST THE BROWNIE WHO HAD CAUSED HER TO EXPECT A LIFE OF EASE AND PLEASURE BUT WHEN SHE LOOKED AT JEGU AND BEHELD HIS RED FACE SQUINTING EYES AND UNTIDY HAIR HER ANGER WAS DOUBLED
1116-132851-0021 WHILE NOW I CAN RECEIVE NO PRESENTS EXCEPT FROM MY HUSBAND I CAN NEVER DANCE EXCEPT WITH MY HUSBAND OH YOU WRETCHED DWARF I WILL NEVER NEVER FORGIVE YOU IN SPITE OF HER FIERCE WORDS NO ONE KNEW BETTER THAN BARBAIK HOW TO PUT HER PRIDE IN HER POCKET WHEN IT SUITED HER
1116-132851-0022 AND AFTER RECEIVING AN INVITATION TO A WEDDING SHE BEGGED THE BROWNIE TO GET HER A HORSE TO RIDE THERE TO HER GREAT JOY HE CONSENTED BIDDING HER SET OUT FOR THE CITY OF THE DWARFS AND TO TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT SHE WANTED
1116-132851-0023 SHE HAD HARDLY SPOKEN WHEN THE HORSE APPEARED AND MOUNTING ON HIS BACK SHE STARTED FOR THE VILLAGE WHERE THE WEDDING WAS TO BE HELD AT FIRST SHE WAS SO DELIGHTED WITH THE CHANCE OF A HOLIDAY FROM THE WORK WHICH SHE HATED THAT SHE NOTICED NOTHING
1116-132851-0024 BUT VERY SOON IT STRUCK HER AS ODD THAT AS SHE PASSED ALONG THE ROADS FULL OF PEOPLE THEY ALL LAUGHED AS THEY LOOKED AT HER HORSE AT LENGTH SHE CAUGHT SOME WORDS UTTERED BY ONE MAN TO ANOTHER WHY THE FARMER'S WIFE HAS SOLD HER HORSE'S TAIL AND TURNED IN HER SADDLE
1116-132851-0025 BUT IT WAS OF NO USE HE DECLINED TO MOVE OUT OF A WALK
1116-132851-0026 SO ONE DAY THE BROWNIE ASKED JEGU IF HE MIGHT BRING HIS FRIENDS TO HAVE SUPPER IN THE GREAT BARN AND WHETHER HE WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DANCE THERE OF COURSE JEGU WAS ONLY TOO PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING FOR THE BROWNIE AND HE ORDERED BARBAIK TO SPREAD HER BEST TABLE CLOTHS IN THE BARN
1116-132851-0027 WHEN ALL WAS READY THE DWARFS IN NEW GREEN SUITS CAME BUSTLING IN VERY HAPPY AND MERRY AND TOOK THEIR SEATS AT THE TABLE BUT IN A MOMENT THEY ALL SPRANG UP WITH A CRY AND RAN AWAY SCREAMING FOR BARBAIK HAD PLACED PANS OF HOT COALS UNDER THEIR FEET AND ALL THEIR POOR LITTLE TOES WERE BURNT
1116-132851-0028 YOU WON'T FORGET THAT IN A HURRY SHE SAID SMILING GRIMLY TO HERSELF BUT IN A MOMENT THEY WERE BACK AGAIN WITH LARGE POTS OF WATER WHICH THEY POURED ON THE FIRE THEN THEY JOINED HANDS AND DANCED ROUND IT SINGING WICKED TRAITRESS
1116-137572-0000 THE WEDDING SHUTS ONE GATE AND OPENS ANOTHER THE LONGINGS AND DREAMINGS OF COURTSHIP ARE AT AN END THE SUPREME INTIMACY OF LIFE BEGINS AS JOHN AND MARY MOVE AWAY FROM THE ALTAR PRONOUNCED MAN AND WIFE THEY KNOW THEY ARE STARTING A GREAT ADVENTURE
1116-137572-0001 HIS BEAMING FACE MASKS A STIFF DETERMINATION TO KEEP HIS BRIDE HAPPY IN SPITE OF ANY WORLDLY OBSTACLES HER RADIANCE HIDES A SOLEMN INWARD VOW TO DO EVERYTHING HUMANLY POSSIBLE TO MAKE SMOOTH THE WAY OF THEIR LIFE TOGETHER THEY ARE RIGHT
1116-137572-0002 UNLESS THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT FROM MOST PEOPLE THIS NEW JOINT ENTERPRISE IS GOING TO MEAN MORE TO EACH OF THEM THAN ANYTHING ELSE EVER CAN BEFORE THEM IS A CLEAR ROAD NOT TO HAPPINESS AS THEY MAY BELIEVE BUT TO THE OPPORTUNITY FOR GAINING HAPPINESS
1116-137572-0003 WHEN ONE HAS RECEIVED THE PROMISE OF SOMETHING GREATLY DESIRED BUT MUST WAIT AWHILE BEFORE ITS DELIVERY THE HAPPINESS OF THE WAITING PERIOD IS CHARACTERIZED BY THE ABSENCE OF A CRITICAL SPIRIT AND THEREFORE IS APT TO BE THOUGHT OF AS AN EXPERIENCE OF PURE DELIGHT
1116-137572-0004 BUT THE FIRST DAYS OF MARRIAGE BRING OUT A DIFFERENT SET OF FEELINGS THOSE THAT COME WHEN ONE HAS DEFINITELY OBTAINED POSSESSION OF ANYTHING THAT BEFORE WAS ONLY PROMISED AT FIRST THE EMOTIONS SEEM TO STAND STILL THIS IS THE LONG COVETED MOMENT THEN ONE BEGINS TO APPRAISE
1116-137572-0005 IS THE OBJECT OF ONE'S WISHES AS DESIRABLE AS ONE HAD EXPECTED BECAUSE REALITY RARELY MEASURES UP TO IMAGINATION THE FIRST ANSWER IS ALMOST BOUND TO BE NO THIS IS NOT WHAT I EXPECTED AND THE FIRST EMOTION TENDS TO BE DISAPPOINTMENT
1116-137572-0006 REGARDLESS OF HAZY BUT OPTIMISTIC EXPECTATIONS AND THE OBJECT POSSESSED WILL MORE THAN LIKELY TURN OUT TO BE BETTER THAN ALTHOUGH DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE IMAGINATION PICTURED KNOWING THAT A FLEETING SENSE OF DISAPPOINTMENT IS NOT PECULIAR TO ONE'S OWN MARRIAGE BUT LIKELY TO OCCUR IN ALL
1116-137572-0007 ROUGHLY BOTH THE HELPS AND THE HINDRANCES TO MARRIED HAPPINESS CAN BE LUMPED UNDER ONE WORD PERSONALITIES TEMPERAMENT MANNERISMS TASTES ALL THAT IS IMPLIED IN THE DISTINCT INDIVIDUALITY OF EACH PERSON MAKE UP THE CHIEF SOURCE OF THE ADVANTAGES
1116-137572-0008 AND DISADVANTAGES WITH WHICH THE COUPLE ENTER MARRIAGE THESE TRAITS CANNOT BE CHANGED OVERNIGHT NOR IS IT NECESSARY OR AT ALL WISE THAT THEY SHOULD BE JOHN ATTRACTS MARY AND SHE APPEALS TO HIM BECAUSE THE PERSONALITY OF EACH ONE IS WHAT IT IS
1116-137572-0009 LOVE HAS GROWN UP BETWEEN THE TWO AS A RESULT OF THIS PERSONALITY ATTRACTION AND LOVE IS THE MOTIVE THAT WILL MAKE BOTH TRY TO KEEP OPEN THE PATHWAY TO MARRIAGE SUCCESS BUT LOVE IS NOT A FINISHED PRODUCT THAT ONCE IT COMES CAN FOREVER AFTER BE TRUSTED TO KEEP ITS STRENGTH
1116-137572-0010 LIKE EVERYTHING ELSE THAT IS ALIVE IT MUST BE KEPT GROWING THROUGH EXERCISE OR IT WASTES AWAY LOVE GIVES THE PUSH THAT KEEPS A MARRIAGE MOVING BUT IT DOES NOT GIVE THE DIRECTION THAT COMES FROM UNDERSTANDING AND COOPERATION
1116-137572-0011 THIS IS WHAT THEY MUST GUARD AGAINST WHILE LOVE IS STILL THE MOVING FORCE OF THEIR LIVES THEY MUST STUDY THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE DUE TO COME TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE BESET BY THEM IS TO BEG FOR TROUBLE
1116-137572-0012 IN ORDER TO COPE WITH THEIR PROBLEMS THEY MUST REALIZE FIRST THAT THEY CANNOT STUMBLE UPON MARRIED HAPPINESS THAT THEY MUST POSSESS AND CULTIVATE A POSITIVE WILL TO SUCCEED
1116-137572-0013 HERE ARE NINE GUIDEPOSTS TO HELP JOHN AND MARY ALONG THEIR ROAD ONE THE FIRST REQUIREMENT IS THE BUILDING OF A UNION THAT IS JUST TO BOTH THE SMALLER ISSUES ON WHICH THIS RESTS ARE THE LIVELY CLASHES OF OPPOSITE DESIRES
1116-137572-0014 INEVITABLE IN THE COMING TOGETHER OF ANY TWO PERSONS INTENSIFIED WHEN THOSE TWO PERSONS ARE AS DIFFERENT AS A MAN AND A WOMAN AND UNAVOIDABLE FOR TWO COMMITTED TO A LIFETIME TOGETHER IN THE CLOSE QUARTERS OF MARRIAGE TWO
1116-137572-0015 COMPROMISE WILL LIFT THESE ESSENTIALLY PETTY DECISIONS OF PRECEDENCE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF SELFISHNESS DECISIONS MUST BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF WHAT IS GOOD FOR BOTH NOT THE SELFISH OR NARROW WISH OF EITHER
1116-137572-0016 THE CHOICE THAT BRINGS THE LARGER ADVANTAGE TO THE TWO PERSONS IN THEIR COMMON ROLE OF MARRIAGE PARTNERS IS THE ONE TO BE MADE HUMAN JUDGMENT BEING AS FAULTY AS IT IS
1116-137572-0017 IN EITHER SITUATION THE PARTICULAR COUPLE INVOLVED HAVE TO WEIGH DELICATELY THE EFFECT ON THEIR JOINT ENTERPRISE OF THE CONFLICTING COURSES OF ACTION MUCH AS MARY MAY CRAVE A CHILD OR A CAR
1116-137572-0018 IF EACH ONE IS HURT AT THE OTHER'S INABILITY TO JOIN INSTANTLY IN HIS OR HER PLANS THEY WILL NEED TO TAKE PAINS NOT TO GET SIDETRACKED INTO MAKING A PERSONAL CONTEST OF THE AFFAIR TRYING TO WIN OVER YOUR PARTNER WITH A SINGLE EYE TO GETTING WHAT YOU WANT
1116-137572-0019 REGARDLESS OF ITS EFFECT ON THE MATE IS SHORT SIGHTED IN THE EXTREME EVEN IF YOU COULD CARE ONLY FOR PERSONAL PLEASURE THAT CANNOT LONG OUTLAST YOUR SPOUSE'S DISPLEASURE STAGING A CONTEST OR A SUCCESSION OF SMALL CONTESTS FOR THE SAKE OF FINDING OUT WHO IS BOSS
1116-137572-0020 BUILDS UP A HABIT OF FIGHTING THAT MAY LEAD TO A BITTER END IT IS USELESS TO DISCOVER WHO CAN WIN IN ANY PARTICULAR SKIRMISH WHAT IS IMPORTANT IS TO LEARN WHETHER ONE OF YOU IS SET ON BEING HEAD OF THE HOUSE IF YOUR SPOUSE CRAVES THAT DISTINCTION BY ALL MEANS HAND IT OVER WITHOUT DELAY
1116-137572-0021 IT IS AN EMPTY HONOR FOR THE ONE WHO BENDS BUT DOES NOT BREAK WILL READILY DEVELOP THE FINE ART OF INFLUENCING THE HEADSTRONG ONE BECAUSE IT IS PART OF THE TRADITIONAL FEMININE CHARACTER TO ENJOY GIVING IN TO THE MAN THIS TENDENCY MUST BE SCRUTINIZED WHEN IT APPEARS
1116-137572-0022 NO MAN CAN AFFORD TO BE CRIPPLED FOR LIFE BY LETTING HIS WIFE SWADDLE HIM WITH SOLICITUDE AS SOME MOTHERS SPOIL THEIR CHILDREN FOR THEIR OWN GLORIFICATION A WOMAN'S FEELING THAT SHE WILL BE EMOTIONALLY GRATIFIED BY MAKING A SACRIFICE DOES NOT PROVE THAT ASIDE FROM HER MOMENTARY PLEASURE
1116-137572-0023 ANY INDIVIDUAL WOMAN MAY WAVER BETWEEN A CRAVING FOR SELF SACRIFICE AND A REPUGNANCE TO THE VERY THOUGHT OF IT THIS CHANGEABLENESS CAN MAKE HER FEEL RESENTFUL AFTER SHE HAS GIVEN IN TO HER HUSBAND ALL THIS MUST BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN MAKING DECISIONS
1116-137572-0024 COMPROMISE NOT SUBMISSION SHOULD BE THE RULE IF JOHN FORGES AHEAD ON ONE COUNT MARY MUST FIND AN ACCEPTABLE OUTLET FOR HERSELF ON SOME OTHER FRONT THREE
1116-137572-0025 AND THE EFFORT TO DO SO TO PLEASE THE PARTNER IS LIABLE TO RESULT IN A TOPHEAVY HYPOCRISY A SUPERSTRUCTURE CALCULATED TO IMPRESS THE OBSERVER BUT BUILT ON A SHAKY FOUNDATION OF CHAOS
1116-137572-0026 A CHAMELEON CHANGES COLOR EASILY TO MATCH ITS ENVIRONMENT OR TEMPER OF THE MOMENT BUT A HUMAN BEING'S MORE LASTING CHANGE IS NOT SO READILY MADE EACH MARRIAGE PARTNER MUST BE PROUD OF THE OTHER AND LET THE OTHER CONTINUE TO BE PROUD OF HIM OR HER
1116-137572-0027 THEREFORE YOU HAVE TO RESPECT YOURSELF AND ACT AS IF YOU DID EVEN AT HOME TOO MANY COUPLES EXPLOIT THE SENSE OF LET DOWN THAT MARRIAGE BRINGS WITH IT AFTER SO LONG A TIME HUSBAND AND WIFE CEASE TO FEEL THAT THEY MUST EXERT THEMSELVES FOR EACH OTHER IN LITTLE MATTERS
1116-137572-0028 KNOWING THEMSELVES ACCEPTED THEY LOUNGE MENTALLY MANNERLY AND PHYSICALLY WHEN AT HOME OR ELSEWHERE ALONE TOGETHER SOME OF THIS RELAXATION IS A GOOD THING BUT IT IS A MISTAKE TO LET HOME AND SPOUSE DEGENERATE INTO NOTHING MORE THAN AN INVITATION TO BE LAZY
1116-137572-0029 USING THE MATE FOR RELIEF AS IN NAGGING WHINING CRYING OR GRUMBLING IS TABOO IF YOU ARE TIRED OR IRRITABLE YOU CAN REST OR EXERCISE FOR RESTORATION AS IN THE DAYS BEFORE MARRIAGE
1116-137572-0030 AND DRY UP THE SOURCE OF REFRESHMENT YOU ARE TRYING TO TAP FATIGUE AND NERVOUSNESS EXPRESSED BREED FATIGUE AND NERVOUSNESS IN A SYMPATHETIC AUDIENCE FOUR TOO GREAT CONCENTRATION IS TO BE AVOIDED
1116-137572-0031 EVEN THE GREATEST LOVE STAGNATES IF IT IS KEPT OUT OF THE MAIN CURRENT OF LIFE TO CARE ONLY FOR EACH OTHER IS SELFISHNESS FOR TWO ONLY ONE STEP REMOVED FROM SELF CENTERED ENGROSSMENT
1116-137572-0032 THIS IS WHY THE UNIQUE VALUE OF CHILDREN IS THEIR SERVICE AS AN ENTERING WEDGE IN THE CLOSE GROWN LOVE OF HUSBAND AND WIFE A WEDGE THAT WIDENS AND HOLDS FOREVER WIDER THE UNITY OF LOVE IT HAS PENETRATED OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES OTHER INTERESTS MAY SERVE A SIMILAR PURPOSE
1116-137572-0033 THOUGH MORE EASILY DISLODGED AND SELDOM STRIKING SO DEEP FRIENDS OLD AND NEW HAVE A FUNCTION IN RELIEVING THE OVERCLOSE CONCERN OF ONE MARRIAGE PARTNER WITH THE OTHER IF THEY ARE TO PLAY THEIR FULL PART IN PREVENTING OVERCONCENTRATION
1116-137572-0034 COMMON FRIENDS ARE FINE BUT FOR THIS PURPOSE THERE IS SPECIAL NEED OF FRIENDS FOR EITHER SPOUSE WHO CAN CALL FORTH THOSE SIDES OF HIS OR HER NATURE THAT ARE NOT AROUSED BY THE MATE
1116-137572-0035 THE FACTOR THAT UNDERLIES ALL THE PERPLEXITIES AND MOST OF THE CONTENTMENT OF MARRIAGE IS ITS UNIQUE DEGREE OF CONCENTRATED INTIMACY HERE THE SUPREME TESTING ALWAYS COMES EACH MEANS SO MUCH TO THE OTHER
1116-137572-0036 THE WIFE MAY BE ALONE PART OF THE DAY AND PROFIT BY IT WHEN JOHN COMES HOME AT NIGHT HE HAS NOT HAD THAT PRIVILEGE
1116-137572-0037 OR BY GOING OUT WITHOUT HIS WIFE OR BY HAVING HIS FRIENDS IN WHEN SHE IS NOT AROUND FIVE THE GENERAL LEVEL OF EMOTION IS WHAT COUNTS NOT THE SPECTACULAR SCALING OF PEAKS STAKING ALL ON HIGH MOMENTS IS MELODRAMA WITH NO COMIC RELIEF
1116-137572-0038 SOME HUSBANDS SOME WIVES ARE ARTISTS AT ACHIEVING AND MOMENTARILY LIVING UP TO ROMANTIC SETTINGS BUT QUICKLY FLOP DOWN TO THE LOWER LEVELS OF DECENT FAIRNESS BETWEEN THE HIGH SPOTS OF THEIR SENTIMENTAL FLARE UPS OTHERS CANNOT UTTER A POETIC PHRASE
1116-137572-0039 MAKE A ROMANTIC GESTURE OR LET THEIR EYES SHOW THE QUICK INTENSITY OF THEIR TENDER EMOTIONS IF THEY MUST DIE FOR IT THIS DIFFERENCE IS ONE OF MAKE UP AND TRAINING NOT OF MARRIAGE CAPACITY THE COUPLE WHO ARE SURE OF EACH OTHER'S STEADY AFFECTION REGARDLESS OF ITS EXPRESSION IN ROMANTIC INTERLUDES
1116-137572-0040 ANOTHER TERRIBLE MOMENT THAT IS DUE TO COME MAY SEEM EVEN MORE FRIGHTENING BECAUSE IT IS YOU WHO ARE SLIPPING SOON OR LATE YOU FIND THAT SOME FAMILIAR MANNERISM OF YOUR SPOUSE DISPLEASES YOU IT MAY BE A SLIGHT UNCOUTHNESS AT TABLE
1116-137572-0041 NOW IT VEXES YOU AND YOUR VEXATION TERRIFIES YOU DOES THIS MEAN THAT YOU NO LONGER LOVE YOUR MATE AS YOU DID YOU CANNOT HELP YOUR CHANGE OF FEELING HOW THEN CAN YOU HOPE TO KEEP YOUR AFFECTION FROM DISAPPEARING ALTOGETHER IF IT HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO WANE
1116-137572-0042 YOU REMEMBER OTHER PEOPLE YOU ONCE THOUGHT YOU LOVED AND WONDER PANIC STRICKEN HOW YOU CAN KEEP THIS LOVE FROM DYING AS THOSE OTHER LOVES DID THIS IS PROBABLY AN ALMOST UNIVERSAL EXPERIENCE MARKING NOT THE BEGINNING OF THE END OF LOVE
1116-137572-0043 MATURITY BRINGS RECOGNITION OF HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS IN THE MOST HEROIC BUT ALSO DEVELOPS THE ABILITY TO WEIGH BIG AND LITTLE THINGS AND TO
1116-137572-0044 ALWAYS IT IS THE UNTURNED PAGE THE HOLDS THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION HOW GOES IT WITH THIS MARRIAGE THE PRESENT IS USEFUL ONLY AS A FOUNDATION STONE FOR THE FUTURE WHICH IS BEING BUILT UP OUT OF MANY FLEETING PRESENT MOMENTS EACH QUICKLY LOST IN THE PAST
1116-137572-0045 SEVEN THERE CAN BE NO NARROWING OF MARRIAGE TO MERE SEX ADJUSTMENT
1116-137572-0046 AND THE TWO PERSONS HAVE TO WORK OUT A COMMON LIFE THAT MEANS SOMETHING TO THEM OVER AND ABOVE THE PLEASURE THEY MAY TAKE IN EACH OTHER'S COMPANY AS A CONTINUING PART OF THIS LIFE ADJUSTMENT SEX ADJUSTMENT CAN DEVELOP INTO A PERMANENT FACTOR OF MARRIED HAPPINESS
1116-137572-0047 BUT WITHOUT THE LARGER ADJUSTMENT THE PARTIAL ADJUSTMENT CANNOT BE MADE IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL AND ENDURING FORM IN THE SEX LIFE IN MARRIAGE AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE ASSOCIATION EACH PARTNER WINS BY CONSIDERING THE OTHER BEFORE THE SELF
1116-137572-0048 BUT INSTEAD A COMPLETE TRUST IN EACH OTHER ONE WHO PRIDES HIMSELF OR HERSELF ON HAVING TO BE HANDLED WITH GLOVES HAS A GREAT DEAL OF GROWING UP TO DO IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE AN ACTIVE PARTNER IN THE MARRIAGE CRY BABYING IS NO MORE HELPFUL IN MARRIAGE THAN IN BUSINESS OR SOCIAL LIFE
1116-137572-0049 IN THE HEALTHY MARRIAGE THIS SYMPATHETIC RESPONSE WILL SOON GIVE WAY TO ANGER WHICH IN TURN MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF A DASH OF COLD WATER IN THE FACE OF THE OVERSENSITIVE ONE HELPING HIM OR HER TO BUCK UP AND BEHAVE LIKE AN ADULT IN THE UNHEALTHY MARRIAGE SYMPATHY WILL GROW INTO PITY
1116-137572-0050 THE MARRIAGE PARTNER WHO IS MATURE WILL MAINTAIN TRUST IN THE OTHER'S GOOD INTENTIONS IN THE FACE OF WHAT MIGHT SEEM TO BE OCCASIONS FOR HURT FEELINGS A CHIEF ADVANTAGE OF THE MARRIED ESTATE IS ITS OPPORTUNITY FOR FRANKNESS WHY DOESN'T HIS WIFE TELL HIM OF THAT UNPLEASANT MANNERISM SO HE CAN CORRECT IT
1116-137572-0051 MARY MAY SOON LOSE COURAGE AND RELINQUISH HER WIFELY JOB OF HUSBAND IMPROVEMENT OR THE COMBINATION MAY BE REVERSED FRANKNESS MUST GO CLOTHED IN TACT STIFF MINDED PEOPLE WHO ARE FRANK ONLY WHEN ANGRY LOSE THEIR CASE BEFORE THEY PRESENT IT
1116-137572-0052 IF THE EXPRESSION OF ANGER IS TO HAVE ITS PROPER STIMULATIVE EFFECT IT HAS TO BE ADMINISTERED BUT RARELY AND THEN IN SMALL DOSES MORE HAS A PARALYZING EFFECT ON THE RECIPIENT
1116-137572-0053 PRODUCING A RESPONSE IN KIND THAT TAKES AWAY THE ABILITY TO THINK OF ANYTHING EXCEPT RETALIATION NINE WILLINGNESS TO GROW IS THE MOST NECESSARY FACTOR FOR SUCCESS MARRIAGE IS A LIFE PROGRAM OF GOING ON TOGETHER THAT REQUIRES MATURITY
1116-137572-0054 AS THIS IS AN IMPOSSIBILITY THEY ARE AWARE OF INCREASING DISSATISFACTION THAT DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE UNADAPTED TO EACH OTHER THEY ARE AFRAID TO LEAVE THE KNOWN PLEASURES OF THEIR FIRST YOUTH FOR THE UNGUESSED SATISFACTIONS OF MATURITY SO THEY TRY TO STAND STILL
1116-137572-0055 HOPING TO KEEP THEIR MARRIAGE UNCHANGED IN ITS FIRST STAGE OF PROMISE IF BOTH HUSBAND AND WIFE ACCEPT MATURING RESPONSIBILITIES AS THEY COME THEIR MARRIAGE RELATIONSHIP WILL KEEP PACE WITH THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT AND WILL THEREFORE BECOME INCREASINGLY SATISFYING TO THEM

118-124588-0000 MISSUS SAVAREEN SAT UP WAITING FOR HER LORD UNTIL LONG PAST MIDNIGHT BUT HER VIGIL WAS IN VAIN LAPIERRE AFTER CLOSING UP HIS INN FOR THE NIGHT DROPPED IN ACCORDING TO HIS PROMISE TO SEE IF ANY NEWS OF THE ABSENTEE HAD ARRIVED
118-124588-0001 NOTHING FURTHER COULD BE DONE IN THE WAY OF SEARCHING FOR THE LATTER PERSONAGE UNTIL DAYLIGHT IT WAS GETTING ON PRETTY WELL TOWARDS MORNING WHEN MISSUS SAVAREEN SOUGHT HER COUCH AND WHEN SHE GOT THERE HER SLUMBER WAS BROKEN AND DISTURBED SHE KNEW NOT WHAT TO THINK
118-124588-0002 BUT SHE WAS HAUNTED BY A DREAD THAT SHE WOULD NEVER AGAIN SEE HER HUSBAND ALIVE NEXT MORNING SOON AFTER DAYLIGHT THE WHOLE NEIGHBORHOOD WAS ASTIR AND THE COUNTRY ROUND WAS CAREFULLY SEARCHED FOR ANY TRACE OF THE MISSING MAN
118-124588-0003 SQUIRE HARRINGTON WENT DOWN TO TOWN AND MADE INQUIRIES AT THE BANK WHERE HE ASCERTAINED THAT THE STORY TOLD BY SAVAREEN TO OLD JONATHAN PERRY
118-124588-0004 WAS SUBSTANTIALLY CORRECT THIS EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF ANY POSSIBLE THEORY AS TO JONATHAN AND HIS WIFE HAVING MISTAKEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR SAVAREEN SQUIRE HARRINGTON LIKEWISE LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE MAN'S DOINGS ON THE PREVIOUS AFTERNOON
118-124588-0005 AND WAS ABLE TO FIX THE TIME AT WHICH HE HAD STARTED FOR HOME HE HAD RIDDEN FROM THE DOOR OF THE PEACOCK AT ABOUT A QUARTER TO EIGHT
118-124588-0006 PERRY PROFESSED TO HAVE SEEN AND CONVERSED WITH HIM THERE WAS NO LONGER ANY ROOM FOR DOUBT THAT INTERVIEW AND CONVERSATION HAD ACTUALLY TAKEN PLACE AT EIGHT O'CLOCK ON THE PREVIOUS EVENING AND SAVAREEN HAD RIDDEN NORTHWARD FROM THE GATE WITHIN FIVE MINUTES AFTERWARDS HE COULD NOT HAVE PROCEEDED MORE THAN A HUNDRED
118-124588-0007 OR AT THE VERY OUTSIDE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FURTHER OR HE MUST INEVITABLY HAVE BEEN ENCOUNTERED BY LAPIERRE
118-124588-0008 BUT THE HORSE WHICH HAD DISAPPEARED IN THIS UNACCOUNTABLE MANNER IT SEEMED IMPROBABLE THAT TWO LIVING SUBSTANCES OF SUCH BULK SHOULD PASS OUT OF BEING AND LEAVE NO TRACE BEHIND THEM THEY MUST LITERALLY HAVE MELTED INTO THIN AIR NO THEY HADN'T AT LEAST THE BLACK MARE HADN'T
118-124588-0009 FOR SHE WAS DISCOVERED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE SEARCHING PARTY A LITTLE BEFORE NOON WHEN FOUND SHE WAS QUIETLY CROPPING THE DAMP HERBAGE AT THE EDGE OF THE CRANBERRY SWAMP AT THE REAR OF SQUIRE HARRINGTON'S FARM SHE WAS WHOLLY UNINJURED AND HAD EVIDENTLY SPENT THE NIGHT THERE
118-124588-0010 THE BIT HAD BEEN REMOVED FROM HER MOUTH BUT THE BRIDLE HUNG INTACT ROUND HER NECK THE SADDLE HOWEVER LIKE ITS OWNER HAD DISAPPEARED FROM HER BACK THEN THE MEN BEGAN A SYSTEMATIC SEARCH IN THE INTERIOR OF THE SWAMP THEY SOON CAME UPON THE SADDLE WHICH HAD APPARENTLY BEEN DELIBERATELY UNBUCKLED
118-124588-0011 AND DEPOSITED ON A DRY PATCH OF GROUND NEAR THE EDGE OF THE MORASS A LITTLE FURTHER IN THE INTERIOR THEY CAME UPON A MAN'S COAT MADE OF DARK BROWN STUFF
118-124588-0012 AS BELONG TO SAVAREEN IT WAS WET AND BESMIRCHED WITH MUD AND IN FACT WAS LYING HALF IN AND HALF OUT OF A LITTLE PUDDLE OF WATER WHEN IT WAS FOUND THEN THE SEARCHERS MADE SURE OF FINDING THE BODY BUT IN THIS THEY WERE DISAPPOINTED
118-124588-0013 BUT FOUND NOTHING FURTHER TO REWARD THEIR SEARCH THE GROUND WAS TOO SOFT AND MARSHY TO RETAIN ANY TRACES OF FOOTSTEPS AND THE MARE AND SADDLE FURNISHED THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT THE OBJECT OF THEIR QUEST HAD BEEN IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE SWAMP AND OF COURSE THIS EVIDENCE WAS OF THE MOST VAGUE AND INCONCLUSIVE CHARACTER
118-124588-0014 THEN THE PARTY PROCEEDED IN A BODY TO THE MISSING MAN'S HOUSE HERE ANOTHER SURPRISE AWAITED THEM THE COAT WAS AT ONCE RECOGNISED BY MISSUS SAVAREEN AS BELONGING TO HER HUSBAND BUT IT WAS NOT THE COAT WORN BY HIM AT THE TIME OF HIS DISAPPEARANCE OF THIS THERE WAS NO DOUBT WHATEVER
118-124588-0015 IN FACT HE HAD NOT WORN IT FOR MORE THAN A WEEK PREVIOUSLY HIS WIFE DISTINCTLY REMEMBERED HAVING FOLDED AND LAID IT AWAY IN THE TOP OF A LARGE TRUNK ON THE SATURDAY OF THE WEEK BEFORE LAST SINCE WHICH TIME SHE HAD NEVER SET EYES ON IT HERE WAS A DEEPENING OF THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0016 THE SEARCH WAS KEPT UP WITHOUT INTERMISSION FOR SEVERAL DAYS NEARLY ALL OF THE FARMERS IN THE VICINITY TAKING PART IN IT EVEN TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HARVEST WORK WHICH DEMANDED THEIR ATTENTION SQUIRE HARRINGTON WAS ESPECIALLY ACTIVE AND LEFT NO STONE UNTURNED TO UNRAVEL THE MYSTERY
118-124588-0017 LAPIERRE GAVE UP ALL HIS TIME TO THE SEARCH AND LEFT THE ROYAL OAK TO THE CARE OF ITS LANDLADY THE LOCAL CONSTABULARY BESTIRRED THEMSELVES AS THEY HAD NEVER DONE BEFORE
118-124588-0018 WHERE A MAN'S BODY MIGHT POSSIBLY LIE CONCEALED EVERY TRACT OF BUSH AND WOODLAND EVERY BARN AND OUT BUILDING EVERY HOLLOW AND DITCH EVERY FIELD AND FENCE CORNER WAS EXPLORED WITH CAREFUL MINUTENESS EVEN THE WELLS OF THE DISTRICT WERE PEERED INTO
118-124588-0019 FROM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH DOCTOR SCOTT THE LOCAL CORONER HELD HIMSELF IN READINESS TO SUMMON A CORONER'S JURY AT THE SHORTEST NOTICE WHEN ALL THESE MEASURES PROVED UNAVAILING A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE INHABITANTS WAS CONVENED AND FUNDS WERE SUBSCRIBED TO STILL FURTHER PROSECUTE THE SEARCH
118-124588-0020 DEAD OR ALIVE OR WHICH SHOULD THROW ANY LIGHT UPON HIS FATE HAND BILLS PROCLAIMING THIS REWARD AND DESCRIBING THE MAN'S PERSONAL APPEARANCE WERE EXHIBITED IN EVERY BAR ROOM AND OTHER CONSPICUOUS PLACE THROUGHOUT WESTCHESTER AND THE ADJACENT TOWNSHIPS
118-124588-0021 ADVERTISEMENTS SETTING FORTH THE MAIN FACTS WERE INSERTED IN THE PRINCIPAL NEWSPAPERS OF TORONTO HAMILTON AND LONDON
118-47824-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN THE AMAZING MEETING IN THE SHADOWS OF THE OLD COURTYARD BOBBY RETURNED TO HIS BED HE LAY THERE STILL SHIVERING BENEATH THE HEAVY BLANKETS I DON'T DARE HE ECHOED GRAHAM'S WORDS THERE'S NOTHING ELSE ANY ONE CAN SAY
118-47824-0001 I MUST DECIDE WHAT TO DO I MUST THINK IT OVER BUT AS ALWAYS THOUGHT BROUGHT NO RELEASE IT MERELY INSISTED THAT THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS PROVED AT LAST HE HAD BEEN SEEN SLIPPING UNCONSCIOUSLY FROM HIS ROOM AND AT THE SAME HOUR
118-47824-0002 ALL THAT REMAINED WAS TO LEARN HOW HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED THE APPARENT MIRACLES
118-47824-0003 THE WOMAN AT THE LAKE AND IN THE COURTYARD THE MOVEMENT OF THE BODY AND THE VANISHING OF THE EVIDENCE UNDER HIS HAND PAREDES'S ODD BEHAVIOUR ALL BECAME IN HIS MIND PUZZLING DETAILS THAT FAILED TO OBSCURE THE CHIEF FACT
118-47824-0004 AFTER THIS SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT PAREDES'S DETENTION HE HADN'T DREAMED THAT HIS WEARINESS COULD PLACATE EVEN MOMENTARILY SUCH REFLECTIONS BUT AT LAST HE SLEPT AGAIN
118-47824-0005 HE WAS AROUSED BY THE TRAMPING OF MEN AROUND THE HOUSE AND STRANGE HARSH VOICES HE RAISED HIMSELF ON HIS ELBOW AND GLANCED FROM THE WINDOW IT HAD LONG BEEN DAYLIGHT TWO BURLY FELLOWS IN OVERALLS CARRYING PICK AND SPADE ACROSS THEIR SHOULDERS
118-47824-0006 PUSHED THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH AT THE EDGE OF THE CLEARING HE TURNED GRAHAM FULLY DRESSED STOOD AT THE SIDE OF THE BED THOSE MEN BOBBY ASKED WEARILY THE GRAVE DIGGERS GRAHAM ANSWERED THEY ARE GOING TO WORK IN THE OLD CEMETERY TO PREPARE A PLACE FOR SILAS BLACKBURN
118-47824-0007 THAT'S WHY I'VE COME TO WAKE YOU UP THE MINISTER'S TELEPHONED KATHERINE HE WILL BE HERE BEFORE NOON DO YOU KNOW IT'S AFTER TEN O'CLOCK FOR SOME TIME BOBBY STARED THROUGH THE WINDOW AT THE DESOLATE RAGGED LANDSCAPE IT WAS ABNORMALLY COLD EVEN FOR THE LATE FALL
118-47824-0008 DULL CLOUDS OBSCURED THE SUN AND FURNISHED AN ILLUSION OF CROWDING EARTHWARD A FUNEREAL DAY THE WORDS SLIPPED INTO HIS MIND HE REPEATED THEM WHEN YOUR GRANDFATHER'S BURIED GRAHAM ANSWERED SOFTLY WE'LL ALL FEEL HAPPIER WHY BOBBY ASKED
118-47824-0009 IT WON'T LESSEN THE FACT OF HIS MURDER TIME GRAHAM SAID LESSENS SUCH FACTS EVEN FOR THE POLICE BOBBY GLANCED AT HIM FLUSHING YOU MEAN YOU'VE DECIDED TO STAND BY ME AFTER WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT GRAHAM SMILED
118-47824-0010 I SLEPT LIKE A TOP LAST NIGHT I HEARD NOTHING I SAW NOTHING OUGHT I TO WANT YOU TO STAND BY ME BOBBY SAID OUGHTN'T I TO MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT
118-47824-0011 GRAHAM FROWNED IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE HE HAD ANY CONNECTION WITH YOUR SLEEP WALKING LAST NIGHT YET IT'S AS CLEAR AS EVER THAT MARIA AND HE ARE UP TO SOME GAME IN WHICH YOU FIGURE HE SHOULDN'T BE IN JAIL BOBBY PERSISTED GET UP GRAHAM ADVISED
118-47824-0012 BATHE AND HAVE SOME BREAKFAST THEN WE CAN DECIDE THERE'S NO USE TALKING OF THE OTHER THING I'VE FORGOTTEN IT AS FAR AS POSSIBLE YOU MUST BOBBY SPRANG UPRIGHT HOW CAN I FORGET IT
118-47824-0013 HAVE I ANY RIGHT DON'T GRAHAM SAID I'LL BE WITH YOU AGAIN TO NIGHT
118-47824-0014 WHEN BOBBY HAD BATHED AND DRESSED HE FOUND IN SPITE OF HIS MENTAL TURMOIL THAT HIS SLEEP HAD DONE HIM GOOD WHILE HE BREAKFASTED GRAHAM URGED HIM TO EAT TRIED TO DRIVE FROM HIS BRAIN THE MORBID AFTERMATH OF LAST NIGHT'S REVEALING MOMENT
118-47824-0015 THE MANAGER TOOK MY ADVICE BUT MARIA'S STILL MISSING
118-47824-0016 HE STROLLED OVER AND HANDED BOBBY A NUMBER OF NEWSPAPERS WHERE'S ROBINSON BOBBY ASKED I SAW HIM IN THE COURT A WHILE AGO I DARESAY HE'S WANDERING AROUND PERHAPS WATCHING THE MEN AT THE GRAVE HE LEARNED NOTHING NEW LAST NIGHT I WAS WITH HIM AT BREAKFAST I GATHER NOT
118-47824-0017 BOBBY LOOKED UP ISN'T THAT AN AUTOMOBILE COMING THROUGH THE WOODS HE ASKED MAYBE RAWLINS BACK FROM SMITHTOWN OR THE MINISTER THE CAR STOPPED AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE COURT THEY HEARD THE REMOTE TINKLING OF THE FRONT DOOR BELL JENKINS PASSED THROUGH
118-47824-0018 HIS SHARP EXCLAMATION RECALLED HOWELLS'S REPORT WHICH AT THEIR DIRECTION HE HAD FAILED TO MAIL HAD HIS EXCLAMATION BEEN DRAWN BY AN ACCUSER BOBBY STARTED TO RISE GRAHAM MOVED TOWARD THE DOOR THEN JENKINS ENTERED AND STOOD TO ONE SIDE
118-47824-0019 THE FORMER EASY MANNERED UNCOMMUNICATIVE FOREIGNER HE APPEARED MOREOVER TO HAVE SLEPT PLEASANTLY HIS EYES SHOWED NO WEARINESS HIS CLOTHING NO DISARRANGEMENT HE SPOKE AT ONCE
118-47824-0020 OVERCOAT I'VE NEARLY FROZEN DRIVING FROM SMITHTOWN BEFORE EITHER MAN COULD GROPE FOR A SUITABLE GREETING HE FACED BOBBY
118-47824-0021 FACT IS BOBBY I LEFT NEW YORK TOO SUDDENLY
118-47824-0022 YOU SEE I SPENT A GOOD DEAL IN SMITHTOWN YESTERDAY
118-47824-0023 GRAHAM INTERRUPTED WITH A FLAT DEMAND FOR AN EXPLANATION HOW DID YOU GET AWAY
118-47824-0024 LATER MISTER GRAHAM THERE IS A HACK DRIVER OUTSIDE WHO IS EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS THAN YOU HE WANTS TO BE PAID I ASKED RAWLINS TO DRIVE ME BACK BUT HE RUSHED FROM THE COURTHOUSE PROBABLY TO TELEPHONE HIS ROTUND SUPERIOR
118-47824-0025 BOBBY HANDED HIM A BANKNOTE HE DIDN'T MISS GRAHAM'S MEANING GLANCE
118-47824-0026 PAY HIM WILL YOU JENKINS THANKS
118-47824-0027 WHY HE SHOULD FAIL TO REFER TO BOBBY'S QUESTIONS AT THE MOMENT OF HIS ARREST OR TO THE OPENLY EXPRESSED ENMITY OF GRAHAM ONLY ONE THEORY PROMISED TO FIT AT ALL IT WAS NECESSARY FOR THE PANAMANIAN TO RETURN TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0028 COMPELLED HIM TO REMAIN FOR THE PRESENT IN THE MOURNFUL TRAGIC HOUSE THEREFORE HE WOULD CRUSH HIS JUSTIFIABLE ANGER
118-47824-0029 AND HE HAD ASKED FOR MONEY ONLY A TRIFLING SUM YET GRAHAM WOULD GRASP AT THE FACT TO SUPPORT HIS EARLIER SUSPICION PAREDES'S ARRIVAL POSSESSED ONE VIRTUE IT DIVERTED BOBBY'S THOUGHTS TEMPORARILY FROM HIS OWN DILEMMA FROM HIS INABILITY TO CHART A COURSE
118-47824-0030 GRAHAM ON THE OTHER HAND WAS ILL AT EASE
118-47824-0031 FOR HIM YESTERDAY'S INCIDENT WAS NOT SO LIGHTLY TO BE PASSED OVER EVENTUALLY HIS CURIOSITY CONQUERED THE WORDS CAME NEVERTHELESS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY
118-47824-0032 WE TOOK IT FOR GRANTED YOU WOULD FIND IT NECESSARY TO STAY IN SMITHTOWN FOR A WHILE
118-47824-0033 SIMPLE ENOUGH MISTER GRAHAM I TELEPHONED AS SOON AS RAWLINS GOT ME TO THE BASTILLE I COMMUNICATED WITH THE LAWYER WHO REPRESENTS THE COMPANY FOR WHICH I ONCE WORKED HE'S A PROMINENT AND BRILLIANT MAN HE PLANNED IT WITH SOME LOCAL FELLOW WHEN I WAS ARRAIGNED AT THE OPENING OF COURT THIS MORNING
118-47824-0034 THE JUDGE COULD HOLD ME ONLY AS A MATERIAL WITNESS HE FIXED A PRETTY STIFF BAIL BUT THE LOCAL LAWYER WAS THERE WITH A BONDSMAN AND I CAME BACK MY CLOTHES ARE HERE YOU DON'T MIND BOBBY THAT MOMENT IN THE HALL WHEN GRAHAM HAD AWAKENED HIM URGED BOBBY TO REPLY WITH A GENUINE WARMTH
118-47824-0035 I DON'T MIND I'M GLAD YOU'RE OUT OF IT
118-47824-0036 YOUR PRESENCE IN THE PRIVATE STAIRCASE WAS THE LAST STRAW YOU WILL FORGIVE US CARLOS
118-47824-0037 HE SMOKED WITH A VAST CONTENTMENT THAT'S BETTER NOTHING TO FORGIVE BOBBY LET US CALL IT A MISUNDERSTANDING GRAHAM MOVED CLOSER
118-47824-0038 HIS EYES STILL SMILED BUT HIS VOICE WAS HARDER BYGONES ARE BYGONES ISN'T THAT SO BOBBY SINCE YOU WISH IT BOBBY SAID BUT MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE KNOWLEDGE GRAHAM DESIRED LOOMED THE OLD QUESTION WHAT WAS THE MAN'S GAME WHAT HELD HIM HERE
118-47824-0039 ROBINSON ENTERED THE FLESH AROUND HIS EYES WAS PUFFIER THAN IT HAD BEEN YESTERDAY WORRY HAD INCREASED THE INCONGRUOUS DISCONTENT OF HIS ROUND FACE CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT LITTLE I SAW YOU ARRIVE HE SAID RAWLINS WARNED ME
118-47824-0040 BUT I MUST SAY I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D USE YOUR FREEDOM TO COME TO US
118-47824-0041 SINCE THE LAW WON'T HOLD ME AT YOUR CONVENIENCE IN SMITHTOWN I KEEP MYSELF AT YOUR SERVICE HERE IF BOBBY PERMITS IT COULD YOU ASK MORE BOBBY SHRANK FROM THE MAN WITH WHOM HE HAD IDLED AWAY SO MUCH TIME AND MONEY
118-47824-0042 THAT FLEETING SATANIC IMPRESSION OF YESTERDAY CAME BACK SHARPER MORE ALARMING PAREDES'S CLEAR CHALLENGE TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS THE MEASURE OF HIS STRENGTH HIS MIND WAS SUBTLER THAN THEIRS
118-47824-0043 HIS RESERVE AND EASY DARING MASTERED THEM ALL AND ALWAYS AS NOW HE LAUGHED AT THE FUTILITY OF THEIR EFFORTS TO SOUND HIS PURPOSES TO LIMIT HIS FREEDOM OF ACTION BOBBY DIDN'T CARE TO MEET THE UNCOMMUNICATIVE EYES WHOSE DEPTHS HE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO EXPLORE
118-47824-0044 THAT MIGHT MAKE MEN WALK UNCONSCIOUSLY TO ACCOMPLISH THE ENDS OF AN UNSCRUPULOUS BRAIN THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY APPEARED AS MUCH AT SEA AS THE OTHERS
118-47824-0045 AND GLANCING AT BOBBY HE ASKED WITH A HOLLOW SCORN YOU'VE NO OBJECTION TO THE GENTLEMAN VISITING YOU FOR THE PRESENT IF HE WISHES BOBBY ANSWERED
118-47824-0046 ROBINSON JERKED HIS HEAD TOWARD THE WINDOW I'VE BEEN WATCHING THE PREPARATIONS OUT THERE
118-47824-0047 NO HURRY BOBBY ANSWERED WITH A QUICK INTAKE OF BREATH I SUPPOSE NOT ROBINSON SNEERED SINCE EVERYBODY KNOWS WELL ENOUGH WHAT'S IN IT BOBBY AROSE ROBINSON STILL SNEERED YOU'LL BE AT THE GRAVE AS CHIEF MOURNER
118-47824-0048 BOBBY WALKED FROM THE ROOM HE HADN'T CARED TO REPLY HE FEARED AS IT WAS THAT HE HAD LET SLIP HIS INCREASED SELF DOUBT HE PUT ON HIS COAT AND HAT AND LEFT THE HOUSE THE RAW COLD THE YEAR'S FIRST OMEN OF WINTER MADE HIS BLOOD RUN QUICKER
118-47824-0049 FORCED INTO HIS MIND A CLEANSING STIMULATION BUT ALMOST IMMEDIATELY EVEN THAT PROPHYLACTIC WAS DENIED HIM WITH HIS DIRECTION A MATTER OF INDIFFERENCE CHANCE LED HIM INTO THE THICKET AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE HE HAD WALKED SOME DISTANCE
118-47824-0050 THE UNDERBRUSH HAD LONG INTERPOSED A VEIL BETWEEN HIM AND THE CEDARS ABOVE WHOSE ROOFS SMOKE WREATHED IN THE STILL AIR LIKE FANTASTIC FIGURES WEAVING A SHROUD TO LOWER OVER THE TIME STAINED MELANCHOLY WALLS
118-47824-0051 FOR ONCE HE WAS GRATEFUL TO THE FOREST BECAUSE IT HAD FORBIDDEN HIM TO GLANCE PERPETUALLY BACK AT THAT DISMAL AND PENSIVE PICTURE THEN HE BECAME AWARE OF TWIGS HASTILY LOPPED OFF OF BUSHES BENT AND TORN OF THE UNCOVERING THROUGH THESE CARELESS MEANS OF AN OLD PATH
118-47824-0052 THE DULL THUD OF EARTH FALLING REGULARLY HE PAUSED LISTENING THE LABOUR OF THE MEN WAS GIVEN AN UNCOUTH RHYTHM BY THEIR GRUNTING EXPULSIONS OF BREATH OTHERWISE THE NATURE OF THEIR INDUSTRY AND ITS SURROUNDINGS HAD IMPOSED UPON THEM A SILENCE
118-47824-0053 IN ITSELF BEAST LIKE AND UNNATURAL AT LAST A HARSH VOICE CAME TO BOBBY ITS BREVITY POINTED THE PREVIOUS DUMBNESS OF THE SPEAKER DEEP ENOUGH AND BOBBY TURNED AND HURRIED BACK ALONG THE ROUGHLY RESTORED PATH
118-47824-0054 AS IF FLEEING FROM AN IMMATERIAL THING SUDDENLY QUICKENED WITH THE POWER OF ACCUSATION HE COULD PICTURE THE FRESH OBLONG EXCAVATION IN THE SOIL OF THE FAMILY BURIAL GROUND
118-47824-0055 THERE WAS AN IRONICAL JUSTICE IN THE CONDITION OF THE OLD CEMETERY IT HAD RECEIVED NO INTERMENT SINCE THE DEATH OF KATHERINE'S FATHER LIKE EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CEDARS SILAS BLACKBURN HAD DELIVERED IT TO THE SWIFT OBLITERATING FINGERS OF TIME
118-47824-0056 IF THE OLD MAN IN HIS SELFISHNESS HAD PAUSED TO GAZE BEYOND THE INEVITABLE FACT OF DEATH
118-47824-0057 HE WOULD HAVE GUARDED WITH A MORE PRECIOUS INTEREST THE DRAPINGS OF HIS FINAL SLEEP THIS NECESSARY TASK ON WHICH BOBBY HAD STUMBLED HAD MADE THE THICKET LESS CONGENIAL THAN THE HOUSE AS HE WALKED BACK HE FORECASTED WITH A KEEN APPREHENSION HIS APPROACHING ORDEAL
118-47824-0058 COULD HE WITNESS THE DEFINITE IMPRISONMENT OF HIS GRANDFATHER IN A NARROW BOX COULD HE WATCH THE COVERING EARTH FALL NOISILY IN THAT BLEAK PLACE OF SILENCE WITHOUT DISPLAYING FOR ROBINSON
118-47824-0059 A STRANGE MAN APPEARED WALKING FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE HOUSE HIS BLACK CLOTHING RELIEVED ONLY BY NARROW EDGES OF WHITE CUFFS BETWEEN THE SLEEVES AND THE HEAVY MOURNING GLOVES FITTED WITH SOLEMN HARMONY INTO THE LANDSCAPE AND BOBBY'S MOOD
118-47824-0060 SUCH A FIGURE WAS APPROPRIATE TO THE CEDARS
118-47824-0061 HE EMERGED FROM THE FOREST AND SAW AGAIN THE LEISURELY WEAVING OF THE SMOKE SHROUD ABOVE THE HOUSE THEN HIS EYES WERE DRAWN BY THE RESTLESS MOVEMENTS OF A PAIR OF HORSES
118-47824-0062 NO LIKELY PATH YET WHOSE CROSSING IS THE PRICE OF SALVATION HE WAS GLAD TO SEE GRAHAM LEAVE THE COURT AND HURRY TOWARD HIM I WAS COMING TO HUNT YOU UP BOBBY THE MINISTER'S ARRIVED SO HAS DOCTOR GROOM EVERYTHING'S ABOUT READY DOCTOR GROOM
118-47824-0063 IT'S NATURAL ENOUGH HE SHOULD BE HERE BOBBY AGREED INDIFFERENTLY THEY WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE HOUSE GRAHAM MADE IT PLAIN THAT HIS MIND WAS FAR FROM THE SAD BUSINESS AHEAD
118-47824-0064 HE ASKED HE IGNORES WHAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY HE SETTLES HIMSELF IN THE CEDARS AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK OF IT BOBBY ANSWERED THIS MORNING CARLOS GAVE ME THE CREEPS
118-47824-0065 HE SPOKE WITH PRONOUNCED DELIBERATION STARTLING BOBBY
118-47824-0066 GAVE ME THE CREEPS TOO MAKES ME SURER THAN EVER THAT HE HAS AN ABOMINABLY DEEP PURPOSE IN USING HIS WITS TO HANG ON HERE HE SUGGESTS RESOURCES AS HARD TO UNDERSTAND AS ANYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE OLD ROOM YOU'LL CONFESS BOBBY HE'S HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INFLUENCE OVER YOU AN INFLUENCE FOR EVIL
118-47824-0067 I WON'T BLAME CARLOS FOR THAT BOBBY MUTTERED HE INFLUENCED YOU AGAINST YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT GRAHAM PERSISTED TO REFUSE TO LEAVE WITH ME THE NIGHT OF YOUR GRANDFATHER'S DEATH MARIA DID HER SHARE BOBBY SAID HE BROKE OFF LOOKING AT GRAHAM WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING AT
118-47824-0068 I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF SINCE HE CAME BACK GRAHAM ANSWERED IF THERE'S ANY QUEER POWER BEHIND HIS QUIET MANNER MAYBE HE IS PSYCHIC MAYBE HE CAN DO THINGS WE DON'T UNDERSTAND I'VE WONDERED IF HE HAD WITHOUT YOUR KNOWING IT
118-47824-0069 ACQUIRED SUFFICIENT INFLUENCE TO DIRECT YOUR BODY WHEN YOUR MIND NO LONGER CONTROLLED IT IT'S A NASTY THOUGHT BUT I'VE HEARD OF SUCH THINGS YOU MEAN CARLOS MAY HAVE MADE ME GO TO THE HALL LAST NIGHT PERHAPS SENT ME TO THE OLD ROOM THOSE OTHER TIMES
118-47824-0070 NO I WON'T BELIEVE IT I'VE BEEN WEAK HARTLEY BUT NOT THAT WEAK AND I TELL YOU I DID FEEL HOWELLS'S BODY MOVE UNDER MY HAND DON'T MISUNDERSTAND ME GRAHAM SAID GENTLY I MUST CONSIDER EVERY POSSIBILITY YOU WERE EXCITED AND IMAGINATIVE WHEN YOU WENT TO THE OLD ROOM TO TAKE THE EVIDENCE
118-47824-0071 MIGHT HAVE MOVED SPASMODICALLY I MEAN
118-47824-0072 AND THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EVIDENCE BOBBY DEFENDED HIMSELF IF IT HAD BEEN STOLEN EARLIER THE COAT POCKET MIGHT HAVE RETAINED ITS BULGING SHAPE
118-47824-0073 BUT I WAS THERE AND YOU WEREN'T
118-47824-0074 IF IT'S SO FAR FETCHED GRAHAM ASKED QUIETLY WHY DO YOU REVOLT FROM THE IDEA BOBBY TURNED ON HIM AND WHY DO YOU FILL MY MIND WITH SUCH THOUGHTS IF YOU THINK I'M GUILTY SAY SO GO TELL ROBINSON SO
118-47824-0075 HE GLANCED AWAY WHILE THE ANGRY COLOUR LEFT HIS FACE HE WAS A LITTLE DAZED BY THE REALIZATION THAT HE HAD SPOKEN TO GRAHAM AS HE MIGHT HAVE DONE TO AN ENEMY AS HE HAD SPOKEN TO HOWELLS IN THE OLD BEDROOM HE FELT THE TOUCH OF GRAHAM'S HAND ON HIS SHOULDER I'M ONLY WORKING IN YOUR SERVICE GRAHAM SAID KINDLY
118-47824-0076 FOR GROOM HAS BROUGHT THE GHOSTS BACK WITH HIM DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT THAT YOU WANT THE TRUTH DON'T YOU YES BOBBY SAID EVEN IF IT DOES FOR ME
118-47824-0077 YET THAT FLASH OF TEMPER HAD GIVEN HIM COURAGE TO FACE THE ORDEAL A LINGERING RESENTMENT AT GRAHAM'S SUGGESTION LESSENED THE DIFFICULTY OF HIS POSITION ENTERING THE COURT HE SCARCELY GLANCED AT THE BLACK WAGON THERE WERE MORE DARK CLOTHED MEN IN THE HALL RAWLINS HAD RETURNED
118-47824-0078 THE PANAMANIAN HAD CHANGED HIS CLOTHING HE TOO WAS SOMBRELY DRESSED AND INSTEAD OF THE VIVID NECKTIE HE HAD WORN FROM THE COURTHOUSE A JET BLACK SCARF WAS PERFECTLY ARRANGED BENEATH HIS COLLAR HE LOUNGED OPPOSITE THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY
118-47824-0079 HIS EYES STUDYING THE FIRE HIS FINGERS ON THE CHAIR ARM WERE RESTLESS DOCTOR GROOM STOOD AT THE FOOT OF THE STAIRS TALKING WITH THE CLERGYMAN A STOUT AND UNCTUOUS FIGURE
118-47824-0080 FROM HIS THICKLY BEARDED FACE HIS REDDISH EYES GLEAMED FORTH WITH A FRESH INSTABILITY THE CLERGYMAN SHOOK HANDS WITH BOBBY WE NEED NOT DELAY YOUR COUSIN IS UPSTAIRS HE INCLUDED THE COMPANY IN HIS CIRCLING TURN OF THE HEAD ANY ONE WHO CARES TO GO
118-47824-0081 BOBBY FORCED HIMSELF TO WALK UP THE STAIRCASE FACING THE FIRST PHASE OF HIS ORDEAL HE SAW THAT THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY REALIZED THAT TOO FOR HE SPRANG FROM HIS CHAIR AND FOLLOWED BY RAWLINS STARTED UPWARD THE ENTIRE COMPANY CROWDED THE STAIRS
118-47824-0082 GRAHAM SUMMONED KATHERINE ONE OF THE BLACK CLOTHED MEN OPENED THE DOOR OF SILAS BLACKBURN'S ROOM HE STEPPED ASIDE BECKONING
118-47824-0083 BOBBY WENT IN WITH THE OTHERS AUTOMATICALLY THROUGH THE DIM LIGHT HE CATALOGUED REMEMBERED OBJECTS ALL INTIMATE TO HIS GRANDFATHER EACH ODDLY ENTANGLED IN HIS MIND WITH HIS DISLIKE OF THE OLD MAN THE IRON BED THE CHEST OF DRAWERS

1235-135883-0000 HE WAS OBLIGED FROM TIME TO TIME TO VISIT HIS CORRESPONDENTS ON BUSINESS AND ONE DAY BEING UNDER THE NECESSITY OF GOING A LONG JOURNEY ON AN AFFAIR OF IMPORTANCE HE TOOK HORSE AND CARRIED WITH HIM A WALLET CONTAINING BISCUITS AND DATES

1235-135883-0002 THE FOURTH DAY OF HIS JOURNEY HE WAS SO MUCH INCOMMODED BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN AND THE REFLECTION OF THAT HEAT FROM THE EARTH
1235-135883-0003 HAVING ALIGHTED HE TIED HIS HORSE TO A BRANCH AND SITTING DOWN BY THE FOUNTAIN TOOK SOME BISCUITS AND DATES OUT OF HIS WALLET AS HE ATE HIS DATES HE THREW THE SHELLS CARELESSLY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS WHEN HE HAD FINISHED HIS REPAST

1235-135883-0035 THE CHILDREN ALL IN TEARS MADE THE HOUSE RESOUND WITH THEIR GROANS AND THE FATHER NOT BEING ABLE TO RESIST THE IMPULSE OF NATURE MINGLED HIS TEARS WITH THEIRS SO THAT IN A WORD THEY EXHIBITED THE MOST AFFECTING SPECTACLE POSSIBLE
1235-135883-0036 ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING THE MERCHANT APPLIED HIMSELF TO PUT HIS AFFAIRS IN ORDER AND FIRST OF ALL TO PAY HIS DEBTS HE MADE PRESENTS TO HIS FRIENDS GAVE LIBERAL ALMS TO THE POOR
1235-135883-0037 HE GAVE HER IN ADDITION AS MUCH AS THE LAW WOULD ALLOW HIM AT LAST THE YEAR EXPIRED AND HE WAS OBLIGED TO DEPART HE PUT HIS BURIAL CLOTHES IN HIS WALLET BUT WHEN HE CAME TO BID HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN ADIEU THEIR GRIEF SURPASSED DESCRIPTION
1235-135883-0038 WHEN HOWEVER IT BECAME NECESSARY FOR HIM TO TEAR HIMSELF FROM THESE DEAR OBJECTS HE ADDRESSED THEM IN THE FOLLOWING TERMS MY DEAR WIFE AND CHILDREN I OBEY THE WILL OF HEAVEN IN QUITTING YOU FOLLOW MY EXAMPLE
1235-135883-0039 SUBMIT WITH FORTITUDE TO THIS NECESSITY AND CONSIDER THAT IT IS THE DESTINY OF MAN TO DIE HAVING THUS SPOKEN HE WENT OUT OF THE HEARING OF THE CRIES OF HIS FAMILY AND PURSUING HIS JOURNEY ARRIVED ON THE DAY APPOINTED
1235-135883-0040 AN OLD MAN LEADING A HIND APPEARED AND DREW NEAR HIM
1235-135883-0041 BROTHER MAY I ASK WHY YOU ARE COME INTO THIS DESERT PLACE WHICH IS POSSESSED SOLELY BY EVIL SPIRITS AND WHERE CONSEQUENTLY YOU CANNOT BE SAFE FROM THE BEAUTIFUL TREES WHICH ARE SEEN HERE ONE MIGHT INDEED SUPPOSE THE PLACE INHABITED
1235-135883-0042 HE THEN SEATED HIMSELF BY THE MERCHANT AND THEY ENTERED INTO CONVERSATION BUT I SEE DAY SAID SCHEHERAZADE AND MUST LEAVE OFF YET THE BEST OF THE STORY IS TO COME THE SULTAN RESOLVING TO HEAR THE END OF IT
1235-135883-0043 SUFFERED HER TO LIVE THAT DAY ALSO THE NEXT MORNING DINARZADE MADE THE SAME REQUEST TO HER SISTER AS BEFORE MY DEAR SISTER SAID SHE
1235-135883-0044 BUT THE SULTAN WISHING TO LEARN WHAT FOLLOWED BETWIXT THE MERCHANT AND THE GENIE BADE HER PROCEED WITH THAT WHICH SHE DID AS FOLLOWS SIR WHILE THE MERCHANT AND THE OLD MAN WHO LED THE HIND WERE CONVERSING
1235-135883-0045 THEY SAW ANOTHER OLD MAN COMING TOWARDS THEM FOLLOWED BY TWO BLACK DOGS
1235-135883-0046 THE OLD MAN WITH THE HIND TOLD HIM THE ADVENTURE OF THE MERCHANT AND GENIE WITH ALL THAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN THEM PARTICULARLY THE MERCHANT'S OATH
1235-135883-0047 THEY HAD SCARCELY BEGUN TO CONVERSE TOGETHER WHEN THERE ARRIVED A THIRD OLD MAN LEADING A MULE HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE TWO FORMER AND ASKED WHY THE MERCHANT WHO SAT WITH THEM LOOKED SO MELANCHOLY THEY TOLD HIM THE REASON
1235-135883-0048 WHICH APPEARED TO HIM SO EXTRAORDINARY
1235-135883-0049 THE MERCHANT AND THE THREE OLD MEN BEGAN TO LAMENT AND FILL THE AIR WITH THEIR CRIES WHEN THE OLD MAN WHO LED THE HIND SAW THE GENIE LAY HOLD OF THE MERCHANT AND ABOUT TO KILL HIM
1235-135883-0050 I WILL TELL YOU THE HISTORY OF MY LIFE AND OF THE HIND YOU SEE AND IF YOU THINK IT MORE WONDERFUL AND SURPRISING THAN THE ADVENTURE OF THE MERCHANT I HOPE YOU WILL PARDON THE UNFORTUNATE MAN A THIRD OF HIS OFFENCE
1235-135884-0000 WHAT IS MORE MY WIFE SHE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OF AGE WHEN I MARRIED HER SO THAT I MAY JUSTLY SAY SHE OUGHT TO REGARD ME EQUALLY AS HER FATHER HER KINSMAN AND HER HUSBAND
1235-135884-0001 WE LIVED TOGETHER TWENTY YEARS WITHOUT ANY CHILDREN HER BARRENNESS DID NOT EFFECT ANY CHANGE IN MY LOVE I STILL TREATED HER WITH MUCH KINDNESS AND AFFECTION
1235-135884-0002 MY DESIRE OF HAVING CHILDREN ONLY INDUCED ME TO PURCHASE A SLAVE BY WHOM I HAD A SON WHO WAS EXTREMELY PROMISING MY WIFE BEING JEALOUS CHERISHED A HATRED FOR BOTH MOTHER AND CHILD
1235-135884-0003 BUT CONCEALED HER AVERSION SO WELL THAT I KNEW NOTHING OF IT TILL IT WAS TOO LATE MEAN TIME MY SON GREW UP AND WAS TEN YEARS OLD WHEN I WAS OBLIGED TO UNDERTAKE A LONG JOURNEY
1235-135884-0004 BEFORE I WENT I RECOMMENDED TO MY WIFE OF WHOM I HAD NO MISTRUST THE SLAVE AND HER SON AND PRAYED HER TO TAKE CARE OF THEM DURING MY ABSENCE WHICH WAS TO BE FOR A WHOLE YEAR
1235-135884-0005 SHE HOWEVER EMPLOYED THAT TIME TO SATISFY HER HATRED SHE APPLIED HERSELF TO MAGIC
1235-135884-0006 THE WRETCH CARRIED MY SON TO A DESOLATE PLACE WHERE BY HER ENCHANTMENTS SHE CHANGED HIM INTO A CALF AND GAVE HIM TO MY FARMER TO FATTEN PRETENDING SHE HAD BOUGHT HIM
1235-135884-0007 HER ENMITY DID NOT STOP AT THIS ABOMINABLE ACTION BUT SHE LIKEWISE CHANGED THE SLAVE INTO A COW AND GAVE HER ALSO TO MY FARMER AT MY RETURN I ENQUIRED FOR THE MOTHER AND CHILD
1235-135884-0008 YOUR SLAVE SAID SHE IS DEAD AND AS FOR YOUR SON I KNOW NOT WHAT IS BECOME OF HIM I HAVE NOT SEEN HIM THIS TWO MONTHS I WAS AFFLICTED AT THE DEATH OF THE SLAVE
1235-135884-0009 BUT AS SHE INFORMED ME MY SON HAD ONLY DISAPPEARED I WAS IN HOPES HE WOULD SHORTLY RETURN HOWEVER EIGHT MONTHS PASSED AND I HEARD NOTHING OF HIM WHEN THE FESTIVAL OF THE GREAT BAIRAM WAS TO BE CELEBRATED
1235-135884-0010 THE UNFORTUNATE MOTHER OF MY SON I BOUND HER BUT AS I WAS GOING TO SACRIFICE HER SHE BELLOWED PITEOUSLY AND I COULD PERCEIVE TEARS STREAMING FROM HER EYES THIS SEEMED TO ME VERY EXTRAORDINARY
1235-135884-0011 AND FINDING MYSELF MOVED WITH COMPASSION I COULD NOT FIND IN MY HEART TO GIVE HER A BLOW BUT ORDERED MY FARMER TO GET ME ANOTHER MY WIFE WHO WAS PRESENT WAS ENRAGED AT MY TENDERNESS
1235-135884-0012 AND RESISTING AN ORDER WHICH DISAPPOINTED HER MALICE SHE CRIED OUT WHAT ARE YOU DOING HUSBAND SACRIFICE THAT COW YOUR FARMER HAS NOT A FINER NOR ONE FITTER FOR THE FESTIVAL OUT OF DEFERENCE TO MY WIFE I CAME AGAIN TO THE COW
1235-135884-0013 AND COMBATING MY COMPASSION WHICH SUSPENDED THE SACRIFICE WAS GOING TO GIVE HER THE FATAL BLOW WHEN THE VICTIM REDOUBLING HER TEARS AND BELLOWING DISARMED ME A SECOND TIME
1235-135884-0014 I THEN PUT THE MALLET INTO THE FARMER'S HANDS AND DESIRED HIM TO TAKE IT AND SACRIFICE HER HIMSELF FOR HER TEARS AND BELLOWING PIERCED MY HEART THE FARMER LESS COMPASSIONATE THAN MYSELF SACRIFICED HER
1235-135884-0015 THOUGH TO SHE SEEMED VERY FAT TAKE HER YOURSELF SAID I TO HIM
1235-135884-0016 I DID NOT ENQUIRE WHAT HE DID WITH THE COW BUT SOON AFTER HE HAD TAKEN HER AWAY HE RETURNED WITH A FAT CALF THOUGH I KNEW NOT THE CALF WAS MY SON YET I COULD NOT FORBEAR BEING MOVED AT THE SIGHT OF HIM ON HIS PART
1235-135884-0017 AS SOON AS HE BEHELD ME HE MADE SO GREAT AN EFFORT TO COME NEAR ME THAT HE BROKE HIS CORD
1235-135884-0018 WITH HIS HEAD AGAINST THE GROUND AS IF HE MEANT TO EXCITE MY COMPASSION CONJURING ME NOT TO BE SO CRUEL AS TO TAKE HIS LIFE AND DID AS MUCH AS WAS POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO SIGNIFY THAT HE WAS MY SON
1235-135884-0019 I WAS MORE SURPRISED AND AFFECTED WITH THIS ACTION THAN WITH THE TEARS OF THE COW I FELT A TENDER PITY WHICH INTERESTED ME ON HIS BEHALF OR RATHER NATURE DID ITS DUTY
1235-135884-0020 GO SAID I TO THE FARMER CARRY HOME THAT CALF TAKE GREAT CARE OF HIM AND BRING ME ANOTHER IN HIS STEAD IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS MY WIFE HEARD ME GIVE THIS ORDER SHE EXCLAIMED WHAT ARE YOU ABOUT HUSBAND
1235-135884-0021 TAKE MY ADVICE SACRIFICE NO OTHER CALF BUT THAT WIFE I REPLIED I WILL NOT SACRIFICE HIM I WILL SPARE HIM AND PRAY DO NOT YOU OPPOSE ME
1235-135884-0022 THE WICKED WOMAN HAD NO REGARD TO MY WISHES SHE HATED MY SON TOO MUCH TO CONSENT THAT I SHOULD SAVE HIM I TIED THE POOR CREATURE AND TAKING UP THE FATAL KNIFE WAS GOING TO PLUNGE IT INTO MY SON'S THROAT
1235-135884-0023 WHEN TURNING HIS EYES BATHED WITH TEARS IN A LANGUISHING MANNER TOWARDS ME HE AFFECTED ME SO MUCH THAT I HAD NOT STRENGTH TO KILL HIM I LET THE KNIFE FALL AND TOLD MY WIFE POSITIVELY
1235-135884-0024 THAT I WOULD HAVE ANOTHER CALF TO SACRIFICE AND NOT THAT SHE USED ALL HER ENDEAVOURS TO PERSUADE ME TO CHANGE MY RESOLUTION BUT I CONTINUED FIRM
1235-135884-0025 I COME SAID HE TO COMMUNICATE TO YOU A PIECE OF INTELLIGENCE FOR WHICH I HOPE YOU WILL RETURN ME THANKS I HAVE A DAUGHTER THAT HAS SOME SKILL IN MAGIC YESTERDAY
1235-135884-0026 THESE TWO METAMORPHOSES WERE MADE BY THE ENCHANTMENTS OF OUR MASTER'S WIFE WHO HATED BOTH THE MOTHER
1235-135884-0027 THIS IS WHAT MY DAUGHTER TOLD ME SAID THE FARMER AND I COME TO ACQUAINT YOU WITH IT I LEAVE YOU TO JUDGE HOW MUCH I WAS SURPRISED I WENT IMMEDIATELY TO MY FARMER TO SPEAK TO HIS DAUGHTER MYSELF
1235-135884-0028 AS SOON AS I ARRIVED I WENT FORTHWITH TO THE STALL WHERE MY SON WAS KEPT HE COULD NOT RETURN MY EMBRACES BUT RECEIVED THEM IN SUCH A MANNER AS FULLY SATISFIED ME HE WAS MY SON
1235-135884-0029 MY GOOD MAID SAID I CAN YOU RESTORE MY SON TO HIS FORMER SHAPE YES SHE REPLIED I CAN
1235-135884-0030 EXCEPT ON TWO CONDITIONS THE FIRST IS THAT YOU GIVE HIM TO ME FOR MY HUSBAND AND THE SECOND THAT YOU ALLOW ME TO PUNISH THE PERSON WHO CHANGED HIM INTO A CALF AS TO THE FIRST I REPLIED
1235-135884-0031 AS TO WHAT RELATES TO MY WIFE I ALSO AGREE A PERSON WHO HAS BEEN CAPABLE OF COMMITTING SUCH A CRIMINAL ACTION JUSTLY DESERVES TO BE PUNISHED
1235-135884-0032 ONLY I MUST PRAY YOU NOT TO TAKE HER LIFE I AM GOING THEN ANSWERED SHE TO TREAT HER AS SHE TREATED YOUR SON TO THIS I CONSENT SAID I
1235-135884-0033 PROVIDED YOU FIRST OF ALL RESTORE TO ME MY SON
1235-135884-0034 PRONOUNCED OVER IT WORDS THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESSING HERSELF TO THE CALF O CALF IF THOU WEST CREATED BY THE ALMIGHTY AND SOVEREIGN MASTER OF THE WORLD SUCH AS THOU APPEAREST AT THIS TIME CONTINUE IN THAT FORM
1235-135884-0035 BUT IF THOU BE A MAN AND ART CHANGED INTO A CALF BY ENCHANTMENT RETURN TO THY NATURAL SHAPE BY THE PERMISSION OF THE SOVEREIGN CREATOR AS SHE SPOKE SHE THREW WATER UPON HIM
1235-135884-0036 AND IN AN INSTANT HE RECOVERED HIS NATURAL FORM MY SON
1235-135884-0037 WITH SUCH A TRANSPORT OF JOY THAT I KNEW NOT WHAT I WAS DOING IT IS HEAVEN THAT HATH SENT US THIS YOUNG MAID TO REMOVE THE HORRIBLE CHARM BY WHICH YOU WERE ENCHANTED AND TO AVENGE THE INJURY DONE TO YOU AND YOUR MOTHER I DOUBT NOT
1235-135884-0038 BUT IN ACKNOWLEDGMENT YOU WILL MAKE YOUR DELIVERER YOUR WIFE AS I HAVE PROMISED HE JOYFULLY CONSENTED BUT BEFORE THEY MARRIED SHE CHANGED MY WIFE INTO A HIND AND THIS IS SHE WHOM YOU SEE HERE
1235-135884-0039 I DESIRED SHE MIGHT HAVE THIS SHAPE RATHER THAN ANOTHER LESS AGREEABLE THAT WE MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FAMILY WITHOUT HORROR SINCE THAT TIME MY SON IS BECOME A WIDOWER AND GONE TO TRAVEL
1235-135884-0040 IT BEING NOW SEVERAL YEARS SINCE I HEARD OF HIM I AM COME ABROAD TO INQUIRE AFTER HIM AND NOT BEING WILLING TO TRUST ANYBODY WITH MY WIFE TILL I SHOULD RETURN HOME I THOUGHT FIT TO TAKE HER EVERYWHERE WITH ME
1235-135884-0041 THIS IS THE HISTORY OF MYSELF AND THIS HIND IS IT NOT ONE OF THE MOST WONDERFUL AND SURPRISING I ADMIT IT IS SAID THE GENIE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT FORGIVE THE MERCHANT ONE THIRD OF HIS CRIME
1235-135887-0000 THE STORY OF THE GRECIAN KING
1235-135887-0001 THERE WAS IN THE COUNTRY OF YUNAUN OR GREECE A KING WHO WAS LEPROUS AND HIS PHYSICIANS HAD IN VAIN ENDEAVOURED HIS CURE
1235-135887-0002 ARRIVED AT HIS COURT THIS PHYSICIAN HAD LEARNT THE THEORY OF HIS PROFESSION IN GREEK PERSIAN TURKISH ARABIC LATIN SYRIAC AND HEBREW BOOKS HE WAS AN EXPERIENCED NATURAL PHILOSOPHER
1235-135887-0003 I KNOW SAID HE AFTER THE USUAL CEREMONIALS THAT YOUR MAJESTY'S PHYSICIANS HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HEAL YOU OF THE LEPROSY BUT IF YOU WILL ACCEPT MY SERVICE I WILL ENGAGE TO CURE YOU WITHOUT POTIONS
1235-135887-0004 OR EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS THE KING LISTENED TO WHAT HE SAID AND ANSWERED IF YOU BE ABLE TO PERFORM WHAT YOU PROMISE I WILL ENRICH YOU AND YOUR POSTERITY
1235-135887-0005 DO YOU ASSURE ME THAT YOU WILL CURE MY LEPROSY WITHOUT POTION OR APPLYING ANY EXTERNAL MEDICINE YES SIRE REPLIED THE PHYSICIAN I PROMISE MYSELF SUCCESS THROUGH GOD'S ASSISTANCE
1235-135887-0006 AND TO MORROW WITH YOUR MAJESTY'S PERMISSION I WILL MAKE THE TRIAL THE PHYSICIAN RETURNED TO HIS QUARTERS MADE A HOLLOW MACE AND AT THE HANDLE HE PUT IN HIS DRUGS
1235-135887-0007 WITH WHICH NEXT MORNING HE PRESENTED HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING AND FALLING DOWN AT HIS FEET KISSED THE GROUND
1235-135887-0008 AND AFTER A PROFOUND REVERENCE SAID TO THE KING HE JUDGED IT MEET THAT HIS MAJESTY SHOULD TAKE HORSE
1235-135887-0009 THE KING DID SO AND WHEN HE ARRIVED THERE THE PHYSICIAN CAME TO HIM WITH THE MACE AND SAID EXERCISE YOURSELF WITH THIS MACE AND STRIKE THE BALL UNTIL YOU FIND YOUR HANDS AND BODY PERSPIRE
1235-135887-0010 WHEN THE MEDICINE I HAVE PUT UP IN THE HANDLE OF THE MACE IS HEATED WITH YOUR HAND IT WILL PENETRATE YOUR WHOLE BODY AND AS SOON AS YOU PERSPIRE YOU MAY LEAVE OFF THE EXERCISE
1235-135887-0011 IMMEDIATELY ON YOUR RETURN TO YOUR PALACE GO INTO THE BATH AND CAUSE YOURSELF TO BE WELL WASHED AND RUBBED THEN RETIRE TO BED AND WHEN YOU RISE TO MORROW YOU WILL FIND YOURSELF CURED
1235-135887-0012 THE KING TOOK THE MACE AND STRUCK THE BALL WHICH WAS RETURNED BY HIS OFFICERS WHO PLAYED WITH HIM HE PLAYED SO LONG THAT HIS HANDS AND HIS WHOLE BODY WERE IN A SWEAT AND THEN THE MEDICINE SHUT UP IN THE HANDLE OF THE MACE HAD ITS OPERATION
1235-135887-0013 AS THE PHYSICIAN HAD SAID UPON THIS THE KING LEFT OFF PLAY RETURNED TO HIS PALACE ENTERED THE BATH AND OBSERVED VERY EXACTLY HIS PHYSICIAN HAD PRESCRIBED TO HIM
1235-135887-0014 THE NEXT MORNING WHEN HE AROSE HE PERCEIVED WITH EQUAL WONDER AND JOY THAT HIS LEPROSY WAS CURED AND HIS BODY AS CLEAN AS IF IT HAD NEVER BEEN AFFECTED AS SOON AS HE WAS DRESSED HE CAME INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE WHERE HE ASCENDED HIS THRONE
1235-135887-0015 AND SHEWED HIMSELF TO HIS COURTIERS WHO EAGER TO KNOW THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW MEDICINE CAME THITHER BETIMES AND WHEN THEY SAW THE KING PERFECTLY CURED EXPRESSED GREAT JOY
1235-135887-0016 BOWED HIMSELF BEFORE THE THRONE WITH HIS FACE TO THE GROUND THE KING PERCEIVING HIM MADE HIM SIT DOWN BY HIS SIDE PRESENTED HIM TO THE ASSEMBLY AND GAVE HIM ALL THE COMMENDATION HE DESERVED
1235-135887-0017 BUT AS HE TREATED ALL HIS COURT THAT DAY MADE HIM EAT AT HIS TABLE ALONE WITH HIM
1235-135887-0018 BUT CAUSED HIM TO BE CLAD IN A RICH ROBE
1235-135887-0019 CONTINUED EVERY DAY TO LOAD HIM WITH NEW FAVOURS BUT THIS KING HAD A VIZIER WHO WAS AVARICIOUS ENVIOUS AND NATURALLY CAPABLE OF EVERY KIND OF MISCHIEF
1235-135887-0020 HE COULD NOT BEHOLD WITHOUT ENVY THE PRESENTS THAT WERE GIVEN TO THE PHYSICIAN WHOSE OTHER MERITS HAD ALREADY BEGUN TO MAKE HIM JEALOUS
1235-135887-0021 TO EFFECT THIS HE WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM IN PRIVATE THAT HE HAD SOME INFORMATION OF THE GREATEST CONSEQUENCE TO COMMUNICATE THE KING HAVING ASKED WHAT IT WAS SIRE SAID HE
1235-135887-0022 IT IS HIGHLY DANGEROUS FOR A MONARCH TO CONFIDE IN A MAN WHOSE FIDELITY HE HAS NEVER TRIED
1235-135887-0023 I AM WELL INFORMED OF WHAT I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR TO REVEAL TO YOUR MAJESTY THEREFORE DO NOT REST IN DANGEROUS SECURITY IF YOUR MAJESTY BE ASLEEP BE PLEASED TO AWAKE
1235-135887-0024 AND CAME TO SETTLE HIMSELF AT YOUR COURT FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EXECUTING THE HORRIBLE DESIGN WHICH I HAVE INTIMATED NO NO VIZIER INTERRUPTED THE KING
1235-135887-0025 I AM CERTAIN THAT THIS PHYSICIAN WHOM YOU SUSPECT TO BE A VILLAIN AND A TRAITOR IS ONE OF THE BEST AND MOST VIRTUOUS OF MEN YOU KNOW BY WHAT MEDICINE OR RATHER BY WHAT MIRACLE HE CURED ME OF MY LEPROSY
1235-135887-0026 IF HE HAD HAD A DESIGN UPON MY LIFE WHY DID HE SAVE ME THEN HE NEEDED ONLY TO HAVE LEFT ME TO MY DISEASE I COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED IT AS LIFE WAS FAST DECAYING FORBEAR THEN TO FILL ME WITH UNJUST SUSPICIONS
1235-135887-0027 INSTEAD OF LISTENING TO YOU I TELL YOU THAT FROM THIS DAY FORWARD I WILL GIVE THAT GREAT MAN A PENSION OF A THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD PER MONTH FOR HIS LIFE NAY THOUGH I WERE TO SHARE WITH HIM ALL MY RICHES AND DOMINIONS
1235-135887-0028 I SHOULD NEVER PAY HIM SUFFICIENTLY FOR WHAT HE HAS DONE I PERCEIVE IT TO BE HIS VIRTUE THAT RAISES YOUR ENVY BUT DO NOT THINK I WILL BE UNJUSTLY PREJUDICED AGAINST HIM I REMEMBER TOO WELL WHAT A VIZIER SAID TO KING SINBAD HIS MASTER
1235-135887-0029 TO PREVENT HIS PUTTING TO DEATH THE PRINCE HIS SON WHAT THE GRECIAN KING SAID ABOUT KING SINBAD RAISED THE VIZIER'S CURIOSITY WHO SAID I PRAY YOUR MAJESTY TO PARDON ME
1235-135887-0030 IF I HAVE THE BOLDNESS TO ASK WHAT THE VIZIER OF KING SINBAD SAID TO HIS MASTER TO DIVERT HIM FROM PUTTING THE PRINCE HIS SON TO DEATH THE GRECIAN KING HAD THE CONDESCENSION TO SATISFY HIM THAT VIZIER SAID HE
1235-135887-0031 AFTER HAVING REPRESENTED TO KING SINBAD THAT HE OUGHT TO BEWARE LEST ON THE ACCUSATION OF A MOTHER IN LAW HE SHOULD COMMIT AN ACTION OF WHICH HE MIGHT AFTERWARDS REPENT
1246-124548-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FIVE SHE TRIED TO BE CONTENT WHICH WAS A CONTRADICTION IN TERMS SHE FANATICALLY CLEANED HOUSE ALL APRIL SHE KNITTED A SWEATER FOR HUGH SHE WAS DILIGENT AT RED CROSS WORK

1246-124548-0041 COME ON YOU TWIN CITIES OUR HAT IS IN THE RING
1246-124548-0042 A RED HEADED YOUNG MAN WHO SMOKED CIGARETTES IN A LONG AMBER HOLDER CAROL READ THE BOOKLET WITH A CERTAIN WONDER
1246-124548-0043 SHE LEARNED THAT PLOVER AND MINNIEMASHIE LAKES WERE WORLD FAMED FOR THEIR BEAUTEOUS WOODED SHORES AND GAMEY PIKE AND BASS NOT TO BE EQUALLED ELSEWHERE IN THE ENTIRE COUNTRY THAT THE RESIDENCES OF GOPHER PRAIRIE WERE MODELS
1246-124548-0044 OF DIGNITY COMFORT AND CULTURE WITH LAWNS AND GARDENS KNOWN FAR AND WIDE THAT THE GOPHER PRAIRIE SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC LIBRARY IN ITS NEAT AND COMMODIOUS BUILDING WERE CELEBRATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT THE GOPHER PRAIRIE MILLS MADE THE
1246-124548-0045 BEST FLOUR IN THE COUNTRY THAT THE SURROUNDING FARM LANDS WERE RENOWNED
1246-124548-0046 AND THAT THE STORES IN GOPHER PRAIRIE COMPARED FAVORABLY WITH MINNEAPOLIS AND CHICAGO IN THEIR ABUNDANCE OF LUXURIES AND NECESSITIES AND THE EVER COURTEOUS ATTENTION OF THE SKILLED CLERKS SHE LEARNED IN BRIEF
1246-124548-0047 THAT THIS WAS THE ONE LOGICAL LOCATION FOR FACTORIES AND WHOLESALE HOUSES
1246-124548-0048 KENNICOTT WAS TRIUMPHANT WHEN THE COMMERCIAL CLUB DID CAPTURE ONE SMALL SHY FACTORY WHICH PLANNED TO MAKE WOODEN AUTOMOBILE WHEELS BUT WHEN CAROL SAW THE PROMOTER
1246-124548-0049 SHE COULD NOT FEEL THAT HIS COMING MUCH MATTERED AND A YEAR AFTER WHEN HE FAILED SHE COULD NOT BE VERY SORROWFUL
1246-124548-0050 BUT CAROL COULD DISCOVER NO MORE PICTURES NOR INTERESTING FOOD NOR GRACIOUS VOICES NOR AMUSING CONVERSATION NOR QUESTING MINDS SHE COULD SHE ASSERTED ENDURE A SHABBY BUT MODEST TOWN
1246-124548-0051 THE TOWN SHABBY AND EGOMANIAC SHE COULD NOT ENDURE SHE COULD NURSE CHAMP PERRY AND WARM TO THE NEIGHBORLINESS OF SAM CLARK BUT SHE COULD NOT SIT APPLAUDING HONEST JIM BLAUSSER
1246-124550-0000 THOUGH THE ARMISTICE WITH GERMANY WAS SIGNED A FEW WEEKS AFTER HER COMING TO WASHINGTON THE WORK OF THE BUREAU CONTINUED SHE FILED CORRESPONDENCE ALL DAY THEN SHE DICTATED ANSWERS TO LETTERS OF INQUIRY IT WAS AN ENDURANCE OF MONOTONOUS DETAILS
1246-124550-0001 YET SHE ASSERTED THAT SHE HAD FOUND REAL WORK DISILLUSIONS SHE DID HAVE SHE DISCOVERED THAT IN THE AFTERNOON OFFICE ROUTINE STRETCHES TO THE GRAVE SHE DISCOVERED THAT AN OFFICE IS AS FULL OF CLIQUES AND SCANDALS AS A GOPHER PRAIRIE
1246-124550-0002 A FREE SUNDAY IT DID NOT APPEAR THAT THE GREAT WORLD NEEDED HER INSPIRATION BUT SHE FELT THAT HER LETTERS HER CONTACT WITH THE ANXIETIES OF MEN AND WOMEN ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WERE A PART OF VAST AFFAIRS
1246-124550-0003 NOT CONFINED TO MAIN STREET AND A KITCHEN BUT LINKED WITH PARIS BANGKOK MADRID SHE PERCEIVED THAT SHE COULD DO OFFICE WORK WITHOUT LOSING ANY OF THE PUTATIVE FEMININE VIRTUE OF DOMESTICITY THAT COOKING AND CLEANING
1246-124550-0004 NOT TO HAVE TO REPORT TO KENNICOTT AT THE END OF THE DAY ALL THAT SHE HAD DONE OR MIGHT DO WAS A RELIEF WHICH MADE UP FOR THE OFFICE WEARINESS SHE FELT THAT SHE WAS NO LONGER ONE HALF OF A MARRIAGE
1246-124550-0005 WHITE COLUMNS SEEN ACROSS LEAFY PARKS SPACIOUS AVENUES TWISTY ALLEYS DAILY SHE PASSED A DARK SQUARE HOUSE WITH A HINT OF MAGNOLIAS AND A COURTYARD BEHIND IT AND A TALL CURTAINED SECOND STORY WINDOW THROUGH WHICH A WOMAN WAS ALWAYS PEERING
1246-124550-0006 THE WOMAN WAS MYSTERY ROMANCE A STORY WHICH TOLD ITSELF DIFFERENTLY EVERY DAY NOW SHE WAS A MURDERESS NOW THE NEGLECTED WIFE OF AN AMBASSADOR IT WAS MYSTERY WHICH CAROL HAD MOST LACKED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE
1246-124550-0007 WHERE EVERY HOUSE WAS OPEN TO VIEW WHERE EVERY PERSON WAS BUT TOO EASY TO MEET WHERE THERE WERE NO SECRET GATES OPENING UPON MOORS OVER WHICH ONE MIGHT WALK BY MOSS DEADENED PATHS TO STRANGE HIGH ADVENTURES IN AN ANCIENT GARDEN
1246-124550-0008 AS SHE FLITTED UP SIXTEENTH STREET AFTER A KREISLER RECITAL GIVEN LATE IN THE AFTERNOON FOR THE GOVERNMENT CLERKS AS THE LAMPS KINDLED IN SPHERES OF SOFT FIRE AS THE BREEZE FLOWED INTO THE STREET FRESH AS PRAIRIE WINDS AND KINDLIER
1246-124550-0009 AS SHE GLANCED UP THE ELM ALLEY OF MASSACHUSETTS AVENUE AS SHE WAS RESTED BY THE INTEGRITY OF THE SCOTTISH RITE TEMPLE SHE LOVED THE CITY AS SHE LOVED NO ONE SAVE HUGH SHE ENCOUNTERED NEGRO SHANTIES TURNED INTO STUDIOS
1246-124550-0010 WITH ORANGE CURTAINS AND POTS OF MIGNONETTE MARBLE HOUSES ON NEW HAMPSHIRE AVENUE WITH BUTLERS AND LIMOUSINES AND MEN WHO LOOKED LIKE FICTIONAL EXPLORERS AND AVIATORS HER DAYS WERE SWIFT AND SHE KNEW THAT IN HER FOLLY OF RUNNING AWAY
1246-124550-0011 WERE THE MEMBERS OF THE TINCOMB METHODIST CHURCH A VAST RED BRICK TABERNACLE VIDA SHERWIN HAD GIVEN HER A LETTER TO AN EARNEST WOMAN WITH EYE GLASSES PLAID SILK WAIST AND A BELIEF IN BIBLE CLASSES WHO INTRODUCED HER TO THE PASTOR AND THE
1246-124550-0012 THEY WENT TO SUNDAY SERVICE SUNDAY SCHOOL CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR MISSIONARY LECTURES CHURCH SUPPERS PRECISELY AS THEY HAD AT HOME THEY AGREED THAT AMBASSADORS AND FLIPPANT NEWSPAPERMEN AND INFIDEL SCIENTISTS OF THE BUREAUS
1246-124550-0013 WERE EQUALLY WICKED AND TO BE AVOIDED AND BY CLEAVING TO TINCOMB CHURCH THEY KEPT THEIR IDEALS FROM ALL CONTAMINATION THEY WELCOMED CAROL ASKED ABOUT HER HUSBAND GAVE HER ADVICE REGARDING COLIC IN BABIES
1246-124550-0014 PASSED HER THE GINGERBREAD AND SCALLOPED POTATOES AT CHURCH SUPPERS AND IN GENERAL MADE HER VERY UNHAPPY AND LONELY SO THAT SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT NOT ENLIST IN THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE ORGANIZATION AND BE ALLOWED TO GO TO JAIL
1246-124550-0015 ALWAYS SHE WAS TO PERCEIVE IN WASHINGTON AS DOUBTLESS SHE WOULD HAVE PERCEIVED IN NEW YORK OR LONDON A THICK STREAK OF MAIN STREET THE CAUTIOUS DULLNESS OF A GOPHER PRAIRIE APPEARED IN BOARDING HOUSES WHERE LADYLIKE BUREAU CLERKS
1246-124550-0016 ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR THE CAPTAIN INTRODUCED HER TO THE SECRETARY OF A CONGRESSMAN A CYNICAL YOUNG WIDOW WITH MANY ACQUAINTANCES IN THE NAVY THROUGH HER CAROL MET COMMANDERS AND MAJORS NEWSPAPERMEN
1246-124550-0017 CHEMISTS AND GEOGRAPHERS AND FISCAL EXPERTS FROM THE BUREAUS AND A TEACHER WHO WAS A FAMILIAR OF THE MILITANT SUFFRAGE HEADQUARTERS THE TEACHER TOOK HER TO HEADQUARTERS CAROL NEVER BECAME A PROMINENT SUFFRAGIST
1246-124550-0018 INDEED HER ONLY RECOGNIZED POSITION WAS AS AN ABLE ADDRESSER OF ENVELOPES BUT SHE WAS CASUALLY ADOPTED BY THIS FAMILY OF FRIENDLY WOMEN WHO WHEN THEY WERE NOT BEING MOBBED OR ARRESTED TOOK DANCING LESSONS OR WENT PICNICKING UP THE CHESAPEAKE CANAL
1246-124550-0019 THOUGH IT ABSORBED MOST OF HER SALARY AN EXCELLENT NURSE FOR HUGH SHE HERSELF PUT HIM TO BED AND PLAYED WITH HIM ON HOLIDAYS THERE WERE WALKS WITH HIM THERE WERE MOTIONLESS EVENINGS OF READING BUT CHIEFLY WASHINGTON WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PEOPLE
1246-124550-0020 SCORES OF THEM SITTING ABOUT THE FLAT TALKING TALKING TALKING NOT ALWAYS WISELY BUT ALWAYS EXCITEDLY IT WAS NOT AT ALL THE ARTIST'S STUDIO OF WHICH BECAUSE OF ITS PERSISTENCE IN FICTION SHE HAD DREAMED
1246-124550-0021 BUT THEY PLAYED VERY SIMPLY AND THEY SAW NO REASON WHY ANYTHING WHICH EXISTS CANNOT ALSO BE ACKNOWLEDGED SHE WAS SOMETIMES SHOCKED QUITE AS SHE HAD SHOCKED GOPHER PRAIRIE BY THESE GIRLS WITH THEIR CIGARETTES AND ELFISH KNOWLEDGE
1246-124550-0022 THE PRESENCE OF HUGH MADE HER FEEL TEMPORARY SOME DAY OH SHE'D HAVE TO TAKE HIM BACK TO OPEN FIELDS AND THE RIGHT TO CLIMB ABOUT HAY LOFTS BUT THE FACT THAT SHE COULD NEVER BE EMINENT AMONG THESE SCOFFING ENTHUSIASTS
1246-124550-0023 DID NOT KEEP HER FROM BEING PROUD OF THEM FROM DEFENDING THEM IN IMAGINARY CONVERSATIONS WITH KENNICOTT WHO GRUNTED SHE COULD HEAR HIS VOICE THEY'RE SIMPLY A BUNCH OF WILD IMPRACTICAL THEORISTS SITTIN ROUND CHEWING THE RAG AND
1246-124550-0024 THE ACCEPTANCE OF WOMEN WITHOUT EMBARRASSED BANTER FOR WHICH SHE HAD LONGED IN GOPHER PRAIRIE YET THEY SEEMED TO BE AS EFFICIENT AS THE SAM CLARKS SHE CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OF SECURE REPUTATION NOT HEMMED IN BY THE FIRE OF PROVINCIAL JEALOUSIES
1246-124550-0025 KENNICOTT HAD ASSERTED THAT THE VILLAGER'S LACK OF COURTESY IS DUE TO HIS POVERTY WE'RE NO MILLIONAIRE DUDES HE BOASTED YET THESE ARMY AND NAVY MEN THESE BUREAU EXPERTS AND ORGANIZERS OF MULTITUDINOUS LEAGUES
1246-124550-0026 THAT INSTITUTION IS RESERVED FOR MEN LIKE KENNICOTT WHO AFTER DEVOTING FIFTY YEARS TO PUTTING ASIDE A STAKE INCONTINENTLY INVEST THE STAKE IN SPURIOUS OIL STOCKS
1246-124550-0027 SHE FOUND THE SAME FAITH NOT ONLY IN GIRLS ESCAPED FROM DOMESTICITY BUT ALSO IN DEMURE OLD LADIES WHO TRAGICALLY DEPRIVED OF ESTEEMED HUSBANDS AND HUGE OLD HOUSES
1246-124550-0028 YET MANAGED TO MAKE A VERY COMFORTABLE THING OF IT BY LIVING IN SMALL FLATS AND HAVING TIME TO READ BUT SHE ALSO LEARNED THAT BY COMPARISON GOPHER PRAIRIE WAS A MODEL OF DARING COLOR CLEVER PLANNING AND FRENZIED INTELLECTUALITY
1246-124550-0029 FROM HER TEACHER HOUSEMATE SHE HAD A SARDONIC DESCRIPTION OF A MIDDLEWESTERN RAILROAD DIVISION TOWN OF THE SAME SIZE AS GOPHER PRAIRIE BUT DEVOID OF LAWNS AND TREES A TOWN WHERE THE TRACKS SPRAWLED ALONG THE CINDER SCABBED MAIN STREET AND THE RAILROAD SHOPS
1246-124550-0030 DRIPPING SOOT FROM EAVES AND DOORWAY ROLLED OUT SMOKE IN GREASY COILS OTHER TOWNS SHE CAME TO KNOW BY ANECDOTE A PRAIRIE VILLAGE WHERE THE WIND BLEW ALL DAY LONG AND THE MUD WAS TWO FEET THICK IN SPRING AND IN SUMMER
1246-124550-0031 NEW ENGLAND MILL TOWNS WITH THE HANDS LIVING IN ROWS OF COTTAGES LIKE BLOCKS OF LAVA A RICH FARMING CENTER IN NEW JERSEY OFF THE RAILROAD FURIOUSLY PIOUS RULED BY OLD MEN UNBELIEVABLY IGNORANT OLD MEN
1246-124550-0032 SITTING ABOUT THE GROCERY TALKING OF JAMES G BLAINE A SOUTHERN TOWN FULL OF THE MAGNOLIAS AND WHITE COLUMNS WHICH CAROL HAD ACCEPTED AS PROOF OF ROMANCE BUT HATING THE NEGROES OBSEQUIOUS TO THE OLD FAMILIES
1246-124550-0033 A WESTERN MINING SETTLEMENT LIKE A TUMOR A BOOMING SEMI CITY WITH PARKS AND CLEVER ARCHITECTS VISITED BY FAMOUS PIANISTS AND UNCTUOUS LECTURERS BUT IRRITABLE FROM A STRUGGLE BETWEEN UNION LABOR AND THE MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION
1246-124550-0034 THE LINES ARE BROKEN AND UNCERTAIN OF DIRECTION OFTEN INSTEAD OF RISING THEY SINK IN WAVERING SCRAWLS AND THE COLORS ARE WATERY BLUE AND PINK AND THE DIM GRAY OF RUBBED PENCIL MARKS A FEW LINES ARE TRACEABLE
1246-124550-0035 UNHAPPY WOMEN ARE GIVEN TO PROTECTING THEIR SENSITIVENESS BY CYNICAL GOSSIP BY WHINING BY HIGH CHURCH AND NEW THOUGHT RELIGIONS OR BY A FOG OF VAGUENESS CAROL HAD HIDDEN IN NONE OF THESE REFUGES FROM REALITY
1246-124550-0036 BUT SHE WHO WAS TENDER AND MERRY HAD BEEN MADE TIMOROUS BY GOPHER PRAIRIE EVEN HER FLIGHT HAD BEEN BUT THE TEMPORARY COURAGE OF PANIC THE THING SHE GAINED IN WASHINGTON WAS NOT INFORMATION ABOUT OFFICE SYSTEMS AND LABOR UNIONS BUT RENEWED COURAGE
1246-124550-0037 THAT AMIABLE CONTEMPT CALLED POISE HER GLIMPSE OF TASKS INVOLVING MILLIONS OF PEOPLE AND A SCORE OF NATIONS REDUCED MAIN STREET FROM BLOATED IMPORTANCE TO ITS ACTUAL PETTINESS SHE COULD NEVER AGAIN BE QUITE SO AWED BY THE POWER
1246-124550-0038 SHE CAUGHT SOMETHING OF AN IMPERSONAL ATTITUDE SAW THAT SHE HAD BEEN AS TOUCHILY PERSONAL AS MAUD DYER AND WHY SHE BEGAN TO ASK DID SHE RAGE AT INDIVIDUALS NOT INDIVIDUALS BUT INSTITUTIONS ARE THE ENEMIES
1246-124550-0039 AND THEY MOST AFFLICT THE DISCIPLES WHO THE MOST GENEROUSLY SERVE THEM
1246-135815-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN JOHNNY CHUCK JOINS THE CLASS
1246-135815-0001 PETER RABBIT DELIVERED MOTHER NATURE'S MESSAGE TO JOHNNY CHUCK JOHNNY DIDN'T SEEM AT ALL PLEASED HE GRUMBLED AND GROWLED TO HIMSELF HE DIDN'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL HE DIDN'T WANT TO LEARN ANYTHING ABOUT HIS RELATIVES
1246-135815-0002 HE WAS PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH THINGS AS THEY WERE THE TRUTH IS JOHNNY CHUCK WAS ALREADY BEGINNING TO GET FAT WITH GOOD LIVING AND HE IS NATURALLY LAZY AS A RULE HE CAN FIND PLENTY TO EAT VERY NEAR HIS HOME
1246-135815-0003 SO HE SELDOM GOES FAR FROM HIS OWN DOORSTEP PETER LEFT HIM GRUMBLING AND GROWLING AND CHUCKLED TO HIMSELF ALL THE WAY BACK TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH HE KNEW THAT JOHNNY CHUCK WOULD NOT DARE DISOBEY OLD MOTHER NATURE
1246-135815-0004 SURE ENOUGH THE NEXT MORNING JOHNNY CHUCK CAME WADDLING THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST JUST AS OLD MOTHER NATURE WAS ABOUT TO OPEN SCHOOL HE DIDN'T LOOK AT ALL HAPPY AND HE DIDN'T REPLY AT ALL TO THE GREETINGS OF THE OTHERS
1246-135815-0005 IT WASN'T FOR YOUR BENEFIT THAT I SENT WORD FOR YOU TO BE HERE THIS MORNING IT WAS FOR THE BENEFIT OF YOUR FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS NOW SIT UP SO THAT ALL CAN GET A GOOD LOOK AT YOU

1246-135815-0009 JOHNNY HERE IS NOT FOND OF THE GREEN FOREST BUT LOVES THE OLD ORCHARD AND THE GREEN MEADOWS IN SOME PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THERE ARE MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY WHO PREFER TO LIVE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST YOU WILL NOTICE THAT JOHNNY HAS STOUT CLAWS
1246-135815-0010 I CAN CLIMB IF I HAVE TO RETORTED JOHNNY CHUCK INDIGNANTLY I'VE CLIMBED UP BUSHES AND LOW TREES LOTS OF TIMES AND IF I CAN GET A GOOD RUN FIRST I CAN CLIMB UP THE STRAIGHT TRUNK OF A TREE WITH ROUGH BARK TO THE FIRST BRANCHES IF THEY ARE NOT TOO FAR ABOVE GROUND
1246-135815-0011 JOHNNY CHUCK CERTAINLY IS RIGHT AT HOME WHEN IT COMES TO DIGGING YOU OUGHT TO BE THANKFUL THAT HE IS SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE FOR THE HOLES HE HAS DUG HAVE SAVED YOUR LIFE MORE THAN ONCE BY THE WAY PETER SINCE YOU ARE SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THOSE HOLES
1246-135815-0012 PETER WAS DELIGHTED TO AIR HIS KNOWLEDGE THE LAST ONE I WAS IN SAID HE WAS A LONG TUNNEL SLANTING DOWN FOR QUITE A DISTANCE AND THEN STRAIGHTENING OUT THE ENTRANCE WAS QUITE LARGE WITH A BIG HEAP OF SAND OUT IN FRONT OF IT
1246-135815-0013 DOWN A LITTLE WAY THE TUNNEL GREW SMALLER AND THEN REMAINED THE SAME SIZE ALL THE REST OF THE WAY WAY DOWN AT THE FARTHER END WAS A NICE LITTLE BEDROOM WITH SOME GRASS IN IT THERE WERE ONE OR TWO OTHER LITTLE ROOMS
1246-135815-0014 AND THERE WERE TWO BRANCH TUNNELS LEADING UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE GROUND MAKING SIDE OR BACK DOORWAYS THERE WAS NO SAND AROUND EITHER OF THESE AND THEY WERE QUITE HIDDEN BY THE LONG GRASS HANGING OVER THEM
1246-135815-0015 THOSE BACK DOORWAYS ARE VERY HANDY IN TIME OF DANGER DO YOU ALWAYS HAVE THREE DOORWAYS ASKED HAPPY JACK
1246-135815-0016 AND ONCE IN A WHILE ONLY ONE BUT THAT ISN'T REALLY SAFE

125-121124-0000 DANGLARS SIGNATURE THE NEXT MORNING DAWNED DULL AND CLOUDY DURING THE NIGHT THE UNDERTAKERS HAD EXECUTED THEIR MELANCHOLY OFFICE AND WRAPPED THE CORPSE IN THE WINDING SHEET
125-121124-0001 WHICH WHATEVER MAY BE SAID ABOUT THE EQUALITY OF DEATH IS AT LEAST A LAST PROOF OF THE LUXURY SO PLEASING IN LIFE THIS WINDING SHEET WAS NOTHING MORE THAN A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF CAMBRIC
125-121124-0002 HE SLEEPS INDEED AND THIS IS THE MORE STRANGE SINCE THE LEAST CONTRADICTION KEEPS HIM AWAKE ALL NIGHT
125-121124-0003 AND THEY BOTH RETURNED THOUGHTFULLY TO THE PROCUREUR'S STUDY

125-121124-0013 ACCOMPANIED BY ALL THE LEADING MEN OF THE DAY AT THE BAR IN LITERATURE OR THE ARMY
125-121124-0014 LESS OWING TO HIS SOCIAL POSITION THAN TO HIS PERSONAL MERIT THE COUSIN STANDING AT THE DOOR USHERED IN THE GUESTS AND IT WAS RATHER A RELIEF TO THE INDIFFERENT TO SEE A PERSON AS UNMOVED AS THEMSELVES

125-121342-0002 THE AIR BECAME GRAY AND OPALESCENT A SOLITARY LIGHT SUDDENLY OUTLINED A WINDOW OVER THE WAY THEN ANOTHER LIGHT THEN A HUNDRED MORE DANCED AND GLIMMERED INTO VISION UNDER HIS FEET A THICK IRON STUDDED SKYLIGHT TURNED YELLOW
125-121342-0003 IN THE STREET THE LAMPS OF THE TAXI CABS SENT OUT GLISTENING SHEENS ALONG THE ALREADY BLACK PAVEMENT THE UNWELCOME NOVEMBER RAIN HAD PERVERSELY STOLEN THE DAY'S LAST HOUR AND PAWNED IT WITH THAT ANCIENT FENCE THE NIGHT
125-121342-0004 THE SILENCE OF THE THEATRE BEHIND HIM ENDED WITH A CURIOUS SNAPPING SOUND FOLLOWED BY THE HEAVY ROARING OF A RISING CROWD AND THE INTERLACED CLATTER OF MANY VOICES THE MATINEE WAS OVER
125-121342-0005 HE STOOD ASIDE EDGED A LITTLE INTO THE RAIN TO LET THE THRONG PASS A SMALL BOY RUSHED OUT SNIFFED IN THE DAMP FRESH AIR AND TURNED UP THE COLLAR OF HIS COAT CAME THREE OR FOUR COUPLES IN A GREAT HURRY
125-121342-0006 CAME A FURTHER SCATTERING OF PEOPLE WHOSE EYES AS THEY EMERGED GLANCED INVARIABLY FIRST AT THE WET STREET THEN AT THE RAIN FILLED AIR FINALLY AT THE DISMAL SKY LAST A DENSE STROLLING MASS
125-121342-0007 THAT DEPRESSED HIM WITH ITS HEAVY ODOR COMPOUNDED OF THE TOBACCO SMELL OF THE MEN AND THE FETID SENSUOUSNESS OF STALE POWDER ON WOMEN AFTER THE THICK CROWD CAME ANOTHER SCATTERING A STRAY HALF DOZEN A MAN ON CRUTCHES
125-121342-0008 FINALLY THE RATTLING BANG OF FOLDING SEATS INSIDE ANNOUNCED THAT THE USHERS WERE AT WORK NEW YORK SEEMED NOT SO MUCH AWAKENING AS TURNING OVER IN ITS BED PALLID MEN RUSHED BY PINCHING TOGETHER THEIR COAT COLLARS

125-121342-0010 AND THE NUMEROUS UNPLEASANT ASPECTS OF CITY LIFE WITHOUT MONEY OCCURRED TO HIM IN THREATENING PROCESSION THERE WAS THE GHASTLY STINKING CRUSH OF THE SUBWAY THE CAR CARDS THRUSTING THEMSELVES AT ONE LEERING OUT LIKE DULL BORES WHO GRAB YOUR ARM WITH ANOTHER STORY
125-121342-0011 THE QUERULOUS WORRY AS TO WHETHER SOME ONE ISN'T LEANING ON YOU A MAN DECIDING NOT TO GIVE HIS SEAT TO A WOMAN HATING HER FOR IT THE WOMAN HATING HIM FOR NOT DOING IT AT WORST A SQUALID PHANTASMAGORIA OF BREATH
125-121342-0012 AT BEST JUST PEOPLE TOO HOT OR TOO COLD TIRED WORRIED HE PICTURED THE ROOMS WHERE THESE PEOPLE LIVED WHERE THE PATTERNS OF THE BLISTERED WALL PAPERS WERE HEAVY REITERATED SUNFLOWERS ON GREEN AND YELLOW BACKGROUNDS
125-121342-0013 AND ALWAYS THERE WAS THE ECONOMICAL STUFFINESS OF INDOOR WINTER AND THE LONG SUMMERS NIGHTMARES OF PERSPIRATION BETWEEN STICKY ENVELOPING WALLS DIRTY RESTAURANTS WHERE CARELESS TIRED PEOPLE HELPED THEMSELVES TO SUGAR WITH THEIR OWN USED COFFEE SPOONS
125-121342-0014 LEAVING HARD BROWN DEPOSITS IN THE BOWL IT WAS NOT SO BAD WHERE THERE WERE ONLY MEN OR ELSE ONLY WOMEN IT WAS WHEN THEY WERE VILELY HERDED THAT IT ALL SEEMED SO ROTTEN IT WAS SOME SHAME THAT WOMEN GAVE OFF AT HAVING MEN SEE THEM TIRED AND POOR
125-121342-0015 IT WAS SOME DISGUST THAT MEN HAD FOR WOMEN WHO WERE TIRED AND POOR IT WAS DIRTIER THAN ANY BATTLE FIELD HE HAD SEEN
125-121342-0016 AND DANGER IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE WHEREIN BIRTH AND MARRIAGE AND DEATH WERE LOATHSOME SECRET THINGS HE REMEMBERED ONE DAY IN THE SUBWAY WHEN A DELIVERY BOY HAD BROUGHT IN A GREAT FUNERAL WREATH OF FRESH FLOWERS
125-121342-0017 HOW THE SMELL OF IT HAD SUDDENLY CLEARED THE AIR AND GIVEN EVERY ONE IN THE CAR A MOMENTARY GLOW I DETEST POOR PEOPLE THOUGHT AMORY SUDDENLY I HATE THEM FOR BEING POOR POVERTY MAY HAVE BEEN BEAUTIFUL ONCE BUT IT'S ROTTEN NOW
125-121342-0018 AND SAYING SOMETHING TO HIS COMPANION WITH A LOOK OF UTTER DISGUST PROBABLY THOUGHT AMORY WHAT HE SAID WAS MY GOD AREN'T PEOPLE HORRIBLE NEVER BEFORE IN HIS LIFE HAD AMORY CONSIDERED POOR PEOPLE
125-121342-0019 HE THOUGHT CYNICALLY HOW COMPLETELY HE WAS LACKING IN ALL HUMAN SYMPATHY O HENRY HAD FOUND IN THESE PEOPLE ROMANCE PATHOS LOVE HATE AMORY SAW ONLY COARSENESS PHYSICAL FILTH AND STUPIDITY HE MADE NO SELF ACCUSATIONS
125-121342-0020 NEVER ANY MORE DID HE REPROACH HIMSELF FOR FEELINGS THAT WERE NATURAL AND SINCERE HE ACCEPTED ALL HIS REACTIONS AS A PART OF HIM UNCHANGEABLE UNMORAL THIS PROBLEM OF POVERTY TRANSFORMED MAGNIFIED ATTACHED TO SOME GRANDER
125-121342-0021 MORE DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE MIGHT SOME DAY EVEN BE HIS PROBLEM AT PRESENT IT ROUSED ONLY HIS PROFOUND DISTASTE HE WALKED OVER TO FIFTH AVENUE DODGING THE BLIND BLACK MENACE OF UMBRELLAS AND STANDING IN FRONT OF DELMONICO'S HAILED AN AUTO BUS

1263-138246-0036 BARBICANE QUICKLY PUT OUT THE GAS AND LAY DOWN BY HIS COMPANIONS AND THE PROFOUND SILENCE WAS ONLY BROKEN BY THE TICKING OF THE CHRONOMETER MARKING THE SECONDS
1263-139804-0000 SUSTAINS THE SHORTEST LIVED HUMAN BEINGS OF OUR UNIVERSE IT IS SELDOM THAT ANY OF THE CREATURES REACH MORE THAN FOUR YEARS OF AGE ACCORDING TO OUR STANDARDS OF TIME
1263-139804-0001 THEY ARE NEARLY AS LARGE AS WE AND RELATIVELY MUCH LIGHTER IN WEIGHT ALL THE PERIODS OF PHYSICAL GROWTH ARE CORRESPONDINGLY DECREASED CHILDREN WALK FOUR OR FIVE WEEKS AFTER BIRTH
1263-139804-0002 AND ARE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING REGULAR INSTRUCTION AT THE AGE OF FIVE MONTHS STRANGE AS IT MAY SEEM THIS SPHERE WHICH FOR CONVENIENCE WE WILL CALL BRIEF
1263-139804-0003 REVOLVES VERY SLOWLY ON ITS AXIS SO THAT OUR WORLD MAKES FIFTEEN TIMES AS MANY REVOLUTIONS AS THIS PLANET IT REQUIRES BUT LITTLE ARITHMETIC TO FIGURE OUT THAT THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF DO NOT SEE THE SUN RISE VERY OFTEN
1263-139804-0004 ON THIS WORLD OF BRIEF ALL VEGETABLES MATURE IN PERIODS SO SHORT THAT ONE MARVELS WHEN HE HEARS IT THINK OF CEREALS REACHING MATURITY IN SEVEN OR EIGHT OF OUR DAYS OR DURING ONE DAY OF BRIEF
1263-139804-0005 EARLY IN THE MORNING CERTAIN CROPS ARE PLANTED AND ARE HARVESTED AT NIGHT TWO OR MORE DAYS ARE REQUIRED FOR MATURING OTHER CROPS ACTUALLY THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF RAISE THEIR CROPS WITH LESS LABOR THAN IS REQUIRED AMONGST US
1263-139804-0006 IF YOU WERE PERMITTED TO LOOK UPON THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LIFE OF THIS INCREDIBLE WORLD YOUR FIRST SENSATION WOULD BE DIZZINESS NOT TO MENTION THE WEIRDNESS OF ALL SIGHTS THAT WOULD CONFRONT YOU AT EVERY TURN
1263-139804-0007 AND IF BY LEASE OF STRENGTH THEY PASS ON TOWARD AN AGE OF FOUR YEARS IT IS BUT AN EVIDENCE OF THEIR EXCEPTIONAL VITALITY IT SEEMS TO BE TRUE THAT THE EXPERIENCES OF A LONG LIFE OF SIXTY OR EIGHTY YEARS IS CROWDED INTO A NARROW COMPASS OF FOUR YEARS
1263-139804-0008 THERE BEING NO COMPETITION NO TIME OR SPACE IS REQUIRED FOR SENSATIONAL TRASH THUS IF NOTHING OF IMPORTANCE OCCURS NOTHING NEED BE TRANSMITTED THE OFFICIAL NEWS CENSORS DECIDE AS TO THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF OCCURRENCES
1263-139804-0009 THERE NEED NOT BE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF NEWS TELEGRAPHED EACH HOUR THE GOVERNMENT VERIFIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ALL REPORTS BEFORE THEY ARE TRANSMITTED THERE ARE INDEED SOME ADVANTAGES IN THE GOVERNMENT BEING IN CONSTANT TOUCH WITH EACH HOME UNDER ITS CARE
1263-139804-0010 THE ADVERTISING DEPARTMENT PAYS NEARLY ALL EXPENSES OF THIS WHOLE SYSTEM OF JOURNALISM ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR PRIVATE GAIN ARE PAID AT A REGULAR RATE IT COSTS MORE TO ADVERTISE AT CERTAIN PERIODS THAN AT OTHER TIMES
1263-139804-0011 THEY NEVER THINK OF COVERING THE FEET UNDER ANY CHANGE OF CLIMATE IF ONE OF THE BRIEFITES WERE TO STEP UPON THE SHORES OF OUR RUGGED EARTH AND SEE THE COTTON OR WOOL AND LEATHER THAT LIES AROUND OUR FEET IT WOULD APPEAR TO HIM AS THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING IMAGINABLE
1263-139804-0012 NEITHER THE MEN WOMEN NOR CHILDREN SEEM TO SEEK THIS MEANS FOR SELF BEAUTIFYING THEY SEEM TO THINK THAT BEAUTY OF CHARACTER HAS A RADIANCE MORE TO BE DESIRED THAN THE FLASH OF OPALS OR THE LUSTER OF SILKS THEIR GARMENTS PARTAKE OF THE LOOSE FLOWING ORDER
1263-139804-0013 FOR INSTANCE A STRONG FABRIC OF CHOSEN SHADE IS FASTENED AT THE NECK HIP KNEE AND ANKLE AND LIES CARELESSLY OVER THE PARTS BETWEEN THE FEMALES NEVER GRADUATED TO THE CORSET DEGREE AND WHILE THEY DO NOT CUT A SCIENTIFIC FIGURE
1263-139804-0014 TRANSPORTATION THE METHODS OF TRAVELING ARE SO CONTRARY TO OUR CONCEPTIONS AND PRACTICES THAT I ALMOST FORBEAR TO ATTEMPT ANY DESCRIPTION
1263-139804-0015 WHEN AN EXCHANGE OF SEATS IS NECESSARY IT IS ALL DONE SO EASILY AND SO QUICKLY THAT YOU WOULD WONDER WHY WE TOLERATE TROLLEY CARS IN TRAVELING FROM CITY TO CITY A SYSTEM IS IN USE THAT I WILL CALL THE TOBOGGAN SLIDE SYSTEM
1263-139804-0016 ALTHOUGH THE CARS RUN ON WHEELS THE CAR IS RAISED IN A SHAFT ABOUT ONE HUNDRED FEET AND THEN BY GRAVITY IT DASHES TWO OR MORE MILES ACCORDING TO THE LAY OF THE LAND TRAVERSED THEN ANOTHER RISE MORE OR LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED FEET IS EXPERIENCED
1263-139804-0017 AND THEN ANOTHER WILD DASH I HAVE NO WORDS OF PRAISE FOR THIS SYSTEM ALTHOUGH THE BRIEFITES CAN COVER CONSIDERABLE TERRITORY IN AN HOUR THEY LOOK UPON THIS GRAVITY SYSTEM AS A WONDERFUL ACHIEVEMENT FOR IT HAS NOT BEEN IN OPERATION FOR MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED YEARS
1263-139804-0018 THE POWER OF STEAM HAS NEVER BEEN UTILIZED NO GENIUS OF ALL THIS ACTIVE WORLD OF BRIEF EVER CONCEIVED THE IDEA THAT ALMOST UNLIMITED POWER LIES WRAPPED UP IN THIN VAPORY WATER BUT THEY HAVE DISCOVERED WHAT WE WOULD CALL GASEOUS OIL
1263-139804-0019 AND HAVE LEARNED TO PUT IT TO WORK SO THAT IT IS THE MAIN FORCE EMPLOYED IN HOISTING AND ALL OTHER PURPOSES WHERE POWER IS REQUIRED NOTHING LIKE A TRAVELING LOCOMOTIVE HAS EVER BEEN MADE ALTHOUGH I LEARNED THAT A BRIGHT WIZARD WAS EXPERIMENTING
1263-139804-0020 AND THAT HE PROPHESIED GREAT CHANGES WHEN HIS GAS PROPELLED VEHICLE WAS PERFECTED THINK OF HOW MUCH VALUE AN ORDINARY CITIZEN OF OUR WORLD WOULD BE TO THESE BRIEFITES IF HE COULD STEP UPON THEIR WORLD AND COMMUNICATE WITH THEM CONCERNING THE MAGIC WONDERS OF STEAM
1263-139804-0021 AND THE MANNER OF CONSTRUCTING STATIONARY AND MOVABLE ENGINES TO SAY NOTHING OF THE HIDDEN WONDERS OF ELECTRICITY QUADRUPEDS THAT TAKE THE PLACE OF OUR HORSES ARE USED FOR DRAYAGE ALTHOUGH NOTHING EXCEPT THE TWO WHEELED CLASS OF VEHICLES WAS EVER USED UNTIL SOME EIGHTY SEVEN YEARS AGO
1263-139804-0022 PUBLIC HIGHWAYS THESE INTERESTING PEOPLE EXCEL US IN THEIR STYLE AND MANNER OF HOME BUILDING FENCING AND MAKING PUBLIC HIGHWAYS WE ARE HEATHENISH IN OUR PROGRESS ALONG THE LINE OF ROAD MAKING ESPECIALLY
1263-139804-0023 IN ALL MY VAST JOURNEY AMONG THE WORLDS I FOUND ONLY A FEW COMPARATIVELY WHEREON THE ROADS WERE INFERIOR TO OURS IN THE WORLD OF BRIEF THE STATE PRESCRIBES THE MANNER OF PUBLIC HIGHWAYS AND EACH CITIZEN MUST CONTRIBUTE HIS SHARE TO THEIR CREATION AND MAINTENANCE
1263-139804-0024 VERY INTRICATE AND ELABORATE PROBLEMS ARE SOLVED BY THESE PEOPLE OF A FEW YEARS THEY ARE INFERIOR TO US IN A HUNDRED WAYS IN THE BROAD FIELDS OF MANUFACTURE AND INVENTION THEY LAG A LONG DISTANCE IN THE REAR THIS IS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO THEIR LACK OF TIME
1263-139804-0025 RELIGIOUS LIFE THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE PEOPLE OF BRIEF IS ON AN AVERAGE OF A HIGHER TYPE THAN IS FOUND IN OUR WORLD THEIR BELIEF IN IMMORTALITY HAS RUN PARALLEL WITH THEIR EXISTENCE AS A PEOPLE
1263-139804-0026 THE MOST FAITHFUL TRANSLATION OF THIS WORD INTO OUR LANGUAGE WOULD BE GOD AFFLUENCE KERM CHER OR GOD BREATH APPEARED UPON BRIEF FULL GROWN
1263-139804-0027 SIMILAR TO CHRIST HE CONFIRMED HIS IDENTITY BY UNANSWERABLE MIRACLES MANY HOWEVER DISBELIEVED IN KERM CHER AND HELD TO THE OLD AXIOMATIC TRUTHS THUS CREEDS WERE PREVALENT AND THEY REMAIN UNTIL NOW
1263-139804-0028 ONLY THERE IS MUCH LESS VARIETY THAN IS FOUND AMONGST US KERM CHER SET UP A NEW REIGN AND ACCEPTED A TEMPORAL THRONE FOR A SEASON HE FINALLY ANNOUNCED THAT HIS AMBASSADORSHIP WOULD SOON CEASE
1263-139804-0029 AND THAT HIS FOLLOWERS WOULD LOSE THE THRONE OF CIVIL POWER THAT THEY WOULD BE TESTED FOR A SEASON IN THE VALLEY OF HUMILIATION AND BY THE FIRES OF TERRIBLE PERSECUTION AND THAT THEY WHO WOULD ENDURE UNTO THE END WOULD BE GLORIFIED
1263-141777-0000 MOISTURE FROM THE NIGHT'S RAIN HUNG ON THE TREE LEAVES CLUNG IN GLOBULES TO RYNCH'S SWEATING BODY HE LAY ON A WIDE BRANCH TRYING TO CONTROL THE HEAVY PANTING WHICH SUPPLIED HIS LABORING LUNGS
1263-141777-0001 AND HE COULD STILL HEAR THE ECHOES OF THE STARTLED CRIES WHICH HAD COME FROM THE MEN WHO HAD THREADED THROUGH THE WOODS TO THE UP POINTED TAIL FINS OF THE L B NOW HE TRIED TO REASON WHY HE HAD RUN THEY WERE HIS OWN KIND
1263-141777-0002 THEY WOULD TAKE HIM OUT OF THE LONELINESS OF A WORLD HERETOFORE EMPTY OF HIS SPECIES BUT THAT TALL MAN THE ONE WHO HAD LED THE PARTY INTO THE IRREGULAR CLEARING ABOUT THE LIFE BOAT RYNCH SHIVERED
1263-141777-0003 DUG HIS NAILS INTO THE WOOD ON WHICH HE LAY AT THE SIGHT OF THAT MAN DREAM AND REALITY HAD CRASHED TOGETHER SENDING HIM INTO PANIC STRICKEN FLIGHT THAT WAS THE MAN FROM THE ROOM
1263-141777-0004 THE MAN WITH THE CUP AS HIS HEART QUIETED HE BEGAN TO THINK MORE COHERENTLY FIRST HE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND THE STRONG JAWS'S DEN
1263-141777-0005 THEN THE MARKS ON THE GROUND AT THE POINT FROM WHICH HE HAD FALLEN AND THE L B WERE HERE JUST AS HE REMEMBERED BUT NOT FAR FROM THE SMALL SHIP HE HAD DISCOVERED SOMETHING MORE A CAMPSITE WITH A SHELTER FASHIONED OUT OF SPALLS AND VINES
1263-141777-0006 TO GO BACK TO THE SHIP CLEARING WAS TO RISK CAPTURE BUT HE HAD TO KNOW RYNCH LOOKED WITH MORE ATTENTION AT HIS PRESENT SURROUNDINGS DEEP MOLD UNDER THE TREES HERE WOULD HOLD TRACKS THERE MIGHT JUST BE ANOTHER WAY TO MOVE
1263-141777-0007 THOUGH IT WAS BALLED IN UPON ITSELF HE WAS SURE THE CREATURE WAS FULLY AS LARGE AS HE AND THE MENACING CLAWS SUGGESTED IT WAS A FORMIDABLE OPPONENT WHEN IT MADE NO MOVE TO FOLLOW HIM
1263-141777-0008 RYNCH BEGAN TO HOPE IT HAD ONLY BEEN DEFENDING ITS OWN HIDING PLACE FOR ITS PRESENT ATTITUDE SUGGESTED CONCEALMENT STILL FACING THAT FEATURELESS BLOB IN THE TREE THE MAN RETREATED ALERT FOR THE FIRST SIGN OF ADVANCE ON THE PART OF THE CREATURE ABOVE
1263-141777-0009 NONE CAME AND HE DARED TO SLIP AROUND THE BOLE OF THE TREE UNDER WHICH HE STOOD LISTENING INTENTLY FOR ANY CORRESPONDING MOVEMENT OVERHEAD NOW HE WAS FACING THAT SURVIVOR'S CAMP
1263-141777-0010 ANOTHER OBJECT CROUCHED IN THE DARK OF THE LEAN TO SHELTER JUST AS ITS FELLOW WAS ON SENTRY DUTY IN THE TREE ONLY THIS ONE DID NOT HAVE THE SELF COLOR OF THE FOLIAGE TO DISGUISE IT FOUR LIMBED ITS LONG FOREARMS CURVED ABOUT ITS BENT KNEES
1263-141777-0011 AND THE SENSE ORGANS OF EYES AND NOSE SQUEEZED TOGETHER ON THE LOWER QUARTER OF THE ROUNDED PORTION WITH A LINE OF WIDE MOUTH TO SPLIT THE BLUNT ROUND OF THE MUZZLE DARK PITS FOR EYES SHOWED NO PUPIL IRIS OR CORNEA
1263-141777-0012 THE NOSE WAS A BLACK PERFECTLY ROUNDED TUBE JUTTING AN INCH OR SO BEYOND THE CHEEK SURFACE GROTESQUE ALIEN AND TERRIFYING IT MADE NO HOSTILE MOVE AND SINCE IT HAD NOT TURNED ITS HEAD HE COULD NOT BE SURE IT HAD EVEN SIGHTED HIM
1263-141777-0013 BUT IT KNEW HE WAS THERE HE WAS CERTAIN OF THAT AND WAS WAITING FOR WHAT AS THE LONG SECONDS CRAWLED BY RYNCH BEGAN TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS NOT WAITING FOR HIM HEARTENED HE PULLED AT THE VINE LOOP
1263-141777-0014 CLIMBED BACK INTO THE TREE MINUTES LATER HE DISCOVERED THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN TWO OF THE BEASTS WAITING QUIETLY ABOUT THE CAMP AND THAT THEIR SENTRY LINE RAN BETWEEN HIM AND THE CLEARING OF THE L B HE WITHDREW FARTHER INTO THE WOOD
1263-141777-0015 INTENT UPON FINDING A DETOUR WHICH WOULD BRING HIM OUT INTO THE OPEN LANDS NOW HE WANTED TO JOIN FORCES WITH HIS OWN KIND WHETHER THOSE MEN WERE POTENTIAL ENEMIES OR NOT AS TIME PASSED THE BEASTS CLOSED ABOUT THE CLEARING OF THE CAMP
1263-141777-0016 AFTERNOON WAS FADING INTO EVENING WHEN HE REACHED A POINT SEVERAL MILES DOWNSTREAM NEAR THE RIVER SINCE HE HAD COME INTO THE OPEN HE HAD NOT SIGHTED ANY OF THE WATCHERS HE HOPED THEY DID NOT WILLINGLY VENTURE OUT OF THE TREES WHERE THE LEAVES WERE THEIR PROTECTION
1263-141777-0017 RYNCH WENT FLAT ON THE STREAM BANK MADE A WORM'S PROGRESS UP THE SLOPE TO CROUCH BEHIND A BUSH AND SURVEY THE LAND IMMEDIATELY AHEAD THERE STOOD AN OFF WORLD SPACER FINS DOWN NOSE SKYWARD
1263-141777-0018 AND GROUPED NOT TOO FAR FROM ITS LANDING RAMP A COLLECTION OF BUBBLE TENTS A FIRE BURNED IN THEIR MIDST AND MEN WERE MOVING ABOUT IT NOW THAT HE WAS FREE FROM THE WOOD AND ITS WATCHERS AND HAD COME SO NEAR TO HIS GOAL
1263-141777-0019 RYNCH WAS CURIOUSLY RELUCTANT TO DO THE SENSIBLE THING TO RISE OUT OF CONCEALMENT AND WALK UP TO THAT FIRE TO CLAIM RESCUE BY HIS OWN KIND THE MAN HE SOUGHT STOOD BY THE FIRE
1263-141777-0020 SHRUGGING HIS ARMS INTO A WEBBING HARNESS WHICH BROUGHT A BOX AGAINST HIS CHEST HAVING MADE THAT FAST HE PICKED UP A NEEDLER BY ITS SLING BY THEIR GESTURES THE OTHERS WERE ARGUING WITH HIM BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD CAME ON
1263-141777-0021 THAT IDEA MADE SENSE AND IN THE MEANTIME HE WOULD LET THE OTHER PAST HIM FOLLOW ALONG BEHIND UNTIL HE WAS FAR ENOUGH FROM THE CAMP SO THAT HIS FRIENDS COULD NOT INTERFERE THEN THEY WOULD HAVE A MEETING
1263-141777-0022 IN SPITE OF HIS CAUTION RYNCH WAS CLOSE TO BETRAYAL AS HE EDGED AROUND A CLUMP OF VEGETATION GROWING HALF IN HALF OUT OF THE STREAM ONLY A TIMELY RUSTLE TOLD HIM THAT THE OTHER HAD SAT DOWN ON A DRIFT LOG WAITING FOR HIM RYNCH FROZE
1263-141777-0023 SO STARTLED THAT HE COULD NOT THINK CLEARLY FOR A SECOND THEN HE NOTED THAT THE OUTLINE OF THE OTHER'S BODY WAS VISIBLE GROWING BRIGHTER BY THE MOMENT MINUTE PARTICLES OF PALE GREENISH RADIANCE WERE GATHERING ABOUT THE OTHER THE DARK SHADOW OF AN ARM FLAPPED THE RADIANCE SWIRLED
1263-141777-0024 BUT THEY NO LONGER GATHERED IN STRENGTH ENOUGH TO LIGHT HIS PRESENCE NOW HE COULD SEE THEY DRIFTED ABOUT THE VEGETATION ABOUT THE LOG WHERE THE MAN SAT ABOUT ROCKS AND REEDS ONLY THEY WERE THICKER ABOUT THE STRANGER AS IF HIS BODY WERE A MAGNET
1263-141777-0025 HE CONTINUED TO KEEP THEM WHIRLING BY MEANS OF WAVING HAND AND ARM BUT THERE WAS ENOUGH LIGHT TO SHOW RYNCH THE FINGERS OF HIS OTHER HAND BUSY ON THE FRONT PANEL OF THE BOX HE WORE THAT FINGERING STOPPED THEN RYNCH'S HEAD CAME UP AS HE HEARD A VERY FAINT SOUND
1263-141777-0026 NOT A BEAST'S CRY OR WAS IT AGAIN THOSE FINGERS MOVED ON THE PANEL WAS THE OTHER SENDING A MESSAGE BY THAT MEANS RYNCH WATCHED HIM CHECK THE WEBBING COUNT THE EQUIPMENT AT HIS BELT SETTLE THE NEEDLER IN THE CROOK OF HIS ARM
1263-141777-0027 HOWEVER THE OTHER WAS AS WARY OF THAT DARK AS IF HE SUSPECTED WHAT MIGHT LIE IN WAIT THERE HE ANGLED ALONG NORTHWARD AVOIDING CLUMPS OF SCATTERED BRUSH KEEPING IN THE OPEN WHERE RYNCH DARED NOT TAIL HIM TOO CLOSELY
1263-141777-0028 THEIR COURSE PARALLEL TO THE WOODS BROUGHT THEM AT LAST TO A SECOND STREAM THE SIZE OF A RIVER INTO WHICH THE FIRST CREEK EMPTIED HERE THE OTHER SETTLED DOWN BETWEEN TWO ROCKS WITH EVERY INDICATION OF REMAINING THERE FOR A PERIOD
1263-141777-0029 THANKFULLY RYNCH FOUND HIS OWN LURKING PLACE FROM WHICH HE COULD KEEP THE OTHER IN SIGHT THE LIGHT POINTS GATHERED HUNG IN A SMALL LUMINOUS CLOUD OVER THE ROCKS BUT RYNCH HAD PRUDENTLY WITHDRAWN UNDER A BUSH
1263-141777-0030 AND THE SCENT OF ITS AROMATIC LEAVES MUST HAVE DISCOURAGED THE SPARKS FOR NO SUCH CROWN CAME TO HIS SENTRY POST DRUGGED WITH FATIGUE THE YOUNGER MAN SLEPT AWAKING TO FULL DAY A FOG OF BEWILDERMENT
1263-141777-0031 WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE OTHER'S EXPEDITION WAS HE GOING TO USE THE OPEN CUT THROUGH WHICH THE RIVER RAN AS A WAY OF PENETRATING THE WOODED COUNTRY NOW RYNCH CONSIDERED THE PROBLEM FROM HIS OWN ANGLE THE MAN FROM THE SPACER HAD MADE NO EFFORT TO CONCEAL HIS TRAIL
1263-141777-0032 IN FACT IT WOULD ALMOST SEEM THAT HE HAD DELIBERATELY GONE OUT OF HIS WAY TO LEAVE BOOT PRINTS ON FAVORABLE STRETCHES OF GROUND DID HE GUESS THAT RYNCH LURKED BEHIND WAS NOW LEADING HIM ON FOR SOME PURPOSE OF HIS OWN
1263-141777-0033 OR WERE THOSE TRACES LEFT TO GUIDE ANOTHER PARTY FROM THE CAMP TO ADVANCE OPENLY UP THE STREAM BED WAS TO INVITE DISCOVERY RYNCH SURVEYED THE NEARER BANK CLUMPS OF SMALL TREES AND HIGH GROWING BUSHES DOTTED THAT EXPANSE AN IDEAL COVER
1263-141777-0034 THAT SOUND OF SNARLING SPITTING HATE ENDED IN MID CRY AS RYNCH CRAWLED TO THE RIVER BANK THE MAN FROM THE SPACER CAMP HAD BEEN THE FOCUS OF A THREE PRONG ATTACK FROM A FEMALE AND HER CUBS
1263-141777-0035 THREE RED BODIES WERE FLAT AND STILL ON THE GRAVEL AS THE OFF WORLDER LEANED BACK AGAINST A ROCK BREATHING HEAVILY AS RYNCH SIGHTED HIM HE STOOPED TO RECOVER THE NEEDLER HE HAD DROPPED LURCHED AWAY FROM THE ROCK TOWARDS THE WATER
1263-141777-0036 CLAWED AT THE GROUND ABOUT HIM ALREADY HE WAS BURIED TO HIS KNEES THEN HIS MID THIGHS IN THE ARTIFICIAL QUICKSAND BUT HE HAD NOT LOST HIS HEAD AND WAS JERKING FROM SIDE TO SIDE IN AN EFFORT TO PULL FREE RYNCH GOT TO HIS FEET
1263-141777-0037 WALKED WITH SLOW DELIBERATION DOWN TO THE RIVER'S BRINK THE TRAPPED PRISONER HAD SHIED HALFWAY AROUND STRETCHING OUT HIS ARMS TO FIND A FIRMER GRIP ON SOME ROCK LARGE AND HEAVY ENOUGH TO ANCHOR HIM AFTER HIS FIRST STARTLED CRY HE HAD MADE NO SOUND
1263-141777-0038 BUT NOW AS HE SIGHTED RYNCH HIS EYES WIDENED AND HIS LIPS PARTED THE BOX ON HIS CHEST CAUGHT ON A STONE HE HAD DRAGGED TO HIM IN A DESPERATE TRY FOR SUPPORT
1263-141777-0039 THERE WAS A SPITTING OF SPARKS AND THE STRANGER WORKED FRANTICALLY AT THE BUCKLE OF THE WEBBING HARNESS TO LOOSEN IT AND TOSS THE WHOLE THING FROM HIM THE BOX STRUCK ONE OF THE DEAD WATER CATS FLASHED AS FUR AND FLESH WERE SINGED
1263-141777-0040 RYNCH WATCHED DISPASSIONATELY BEFORE HE CAUGHT THE NEEDLER JERKING IT AWAY FROM THE PRISONER THE MAN EYED HIM STEADILY AND HIS EXPRESSION DID NOT ALTER EVEN WHEN RYNCH SWUNG THE OFF WORLD WEAPON TO CENTER ITS SIGHTS ON THE LATE OWNER
1263-141777-0041 SUPPOSE RYNCH'S VOICE WAS RUSTY SOUNDING IN HIS OWN EARS WE TALK NOW THE MAN NODDED

1334-135589-0014 AND A SEVERE ACTION WAS FOUGHT IN THE STREETS OF THE SUBURB OF SAINT ANTOINE IN WHICH NEITHER PARTY HAD THE ADVANTAGE
1334-135589-0015 AND NOT RECEIVING THE ASSISTANCE HE EXPECTED FROM THE SPANIARDS HE FELL BACK TO THE FRONTIERS OF CHAMPAGNE PREVIOUS TO HIS DEPARTURE FROM PARIS EDWARD HAD RECEIVED HUMPHREY'S LETTER EXPLAINING AWAY THE INTENDANT'S CONDUCT
1334-135589-0016 AND THE CONTENTS REMOVED A HEAVY LOAD FROM EDWARD'S MIND BUT HE NOW THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT WAR AND ALTHOUGH HE CHERISHED THE IDEA OF PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE HE WAS RESOLVED TO FOLLOW THE FORTUNES OF THE PRINCE AS LONG AS HE COULD
1334-135589-0017 HE WROTE A LETTER TO THE INTENDANT THANKING HIM FOR HIS KIND FEELINGS AND INTENTIONS TOWARD HIM AND HE TRUSTED THAT HE MIGHT ONE DAY HAVE THE PLEASURE OF SEEING HIM AGAIN HE DID NOT HOWEVER THINK IT ADVISABLE TO MENTION THE NAME OF HIS DAUGHTER
1334-135589-0018 EXCEPT IN INQUIRING AFTER HER HEALTH AND SENDING HIS RESPECTS IT MAY BE YEARS BEFORE I SEE HER AGAIN THOUGHT EDWARD AND WHO KNOWS WHAT MAY HAPPEN
1334-135589-0019 AND EDWARD WITH HIS FRIENDS FOLLOWED HIS FORTUNES AND GAINED HIS GOOD WILL THEY WERE RAPIDLY PROMOTED TIME FLEW ON AND IN THE YEAR SIXTEEN FIFTY FOUR THE COURT OF FRANCE CONCLUDED AN ALLIANCE WITH CROMWELL

1334-135589-0022 EDWARD WHO BUT RARELY HEARD FROM HUMPHREY WAS NOW ANXIOUS TO QUIT THE ARMY AND GO TO THE KING WHO WAS IN SPAIN BUT TO LEAVE HIS COLORS WHILE THINGS WERE ADVERSE WAS IMPOSSIBLE

1334-135589-0055 AND THE KING'S OBLIGATIONS TO THEM ARE MUCH GREATER THAN THEY ARE TO YOU BESIDES MERELY FOR WHAT MAY BE CALLED A POINT OF HONOR FOR IT IS NO MORE IN WHAT AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION WILL YOU PUT HIS MAJESTY
1334-135589-0056 AT ALL EVENTS EDWARD RECOLLECT YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE INTENTIONS OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE WAIT AND SEE WHAT HE PROFFERS FIRST BUT MY DEAR SISTER IT APPEARS TO ME THAT HIS INTENTIONS ARE EVIDENT
1334-135589-0057 WHY HAS HE REBUILT ARNWOOD HE IS NOT GOING TO SURRENDER MY PROPERTY AND MAKE ME A PRESENT OF THE HOUSE
1334-135589-0058 YOU WERE AT THE WARS IT WAS POSSIBLE THAT YOU MIGHT OR MIGHT NOT RETURN HE SAID THIS TO HUMPHREY WHO HAS ALL ALONG BEEN ACTING AS HIS FACTOTUM IN THE BUSINESS AND RECOLLECT AT THE TIME THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE COMMENCED THE REBUILDING OF THE MANSION
1334-135589-0059 WHAT PROSPECT WAS THERE OF THE RESTORATION OF THE KING OR OF YOUR EVER BEING IN A POSITION TO APPLY FOR THE RESTORATION OF YOUR PROPERTY I BELIEVE HOWEVER THAT HUMPHREY KNOWS MORE OF MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS THAN HE HAS MADE KNOWN TO US
1334-135589-0060 AND I THEREFORE SAY AGAIN MY DEAR EDWARD MAKE NO APPLICATION TILL YOU ASCERTAIN WHAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE'S INTENTIONS MAY BE YOUR ADVICE IS GOOD MY DEAR ALICE AND I WILL BE GUIDED BY IT REPLIED EDWARD
1334-135589-0061 AND NOW LET ME GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE FOR YOUR FRIENDS MASTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE THAT MUCH OF THEIR PROPERTY HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY AND PUT INTO OTHER HANDS I KNOW AND PROBABLY THEY EXPECT IT WILL BE RESTORED UPON THEIR APPLICATION TO THE KING
1334-135589-0062 THOSE WHO HOLD THE PROPERTY THINK SO TOO AND SO FAR IT IS FORTUNATE NOW FROM WISER HEADS THAN MINE
1334-135589-0063 BUT AT THE SAME TIME IF THEY WERE TO MEET THE PARTIES AND CLOSE WITH THEM AT ONCE BEFORE THE KING'S INTENTIONS ARE KNOWN THEY WOULD RECOVER THEIR PROPERTY AT A THIRD OR A QUARTER OF THE VALUE NOW IS THEIR TIME
1334-135589-0064 EVEN A FEW DAYS DELAY MAY MAKE A DIFFERENCE THEY CAN EASILY OBTAIN A DELAY FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE MONEYS IMPRESS THAT UPON THEM MY DEAR EDWARD
1334-135589-0065 AND MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT IS ADVICE WHICH MUST BE FOLLOWED REPLIED EDWARD WE MUST GO NOW AND I WILL NOT FAIL TO COMMUNICATE IT TO THEM THIS VERY NIGHT WE MAY AS WELL HERE INFORM THE READER
1334-135589-0066 THAT THE ADVICE WAS IMMEDIATELY ACTED UPON AND THAT CHALONER AND GRENVILLE RECOVERED ALL THEIR ESTATES AT ABOUT FIVE YEARS PURCHASE EDWARD REMAINED AT COURT SEVERAL DAYS HE HAD WRITTEN TO HUMPHREY AND HAD DISPATCHED A MESSENGER WITH THE LETTER
1334-135589-0067 BUT THE MESSENGER HAD NOT YET RETURNED
1334-135589-0068 ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A DRAWING ROOM WAS TO BE HELD AND EDWARD'S SISTERS WERE TO BE PRESENTED EDWARD WAS STANDING WITH MANY OTHERS OF THE SUIT BEHIND THE CHAIR OF THE KING AMUSING HIMSELF WITH THE PRESENTATIONS AS THEY TOOK PLACE
1334-135589-0069 AND WAITING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF HIS SISTERS CHALONER AND GRENVILLE WERE NOT WITH HIM THEY HAD OBTAINED LEAVE TO GO INTO THE COUNTRY FOR THE OBJECT WE HAVE BEFORE REFERRED TO WHEN HIS EYES CAUGHT ADVANCING TOWARD THE KING
1334-135589-0070 MISTER HEATHERSTONE WHO LED HIS DAUGHTER PATIENCE THAT THEY HAD NOT PERCEIVED HIM WAS EVIDENT INDEED HER EYES WERE NOT RAISED ONCE FROM THE NATURAL TIMIDITY FELT BY A YOUNG WOMAN IN THE PRESENCE OF ROYALTY
1334-135589-0071 EDWARD HALF CONCEALED HIMSELF BEHIND ONE OF HIS COMPANIONS THAT HE MIGHT GAZE UPON HER WITHOUT RESERVE
1334-135589-0072 BUT LITTLE ALTERED EXCEPT HAVING GROWN TALLER AND MORE ROUNDED AND PERFECT IN HER FIGURE AND HER COURT DRESS DISPLAYED PROPORTIONS WHICH HER HUMBLE COSTUME AT THE NEW FOREST HAD CONCEALED OR WHICH TIME HAD NOT MATURED
1334-135589-0073 THERE WAS THE SAME PENSIVE SWEET EXPRESSION IN HER FACE WHICH HAD ALTERED LITTLE BUT THE BEAUTIFUL ROUNDED ARMS
1334-135589-0074 AND THE PROPORTION OF THE WHOLE FIGURE WAS A SURPRISE TO HIM AND EDWARD IN HIS OWN MIND AGREED THAT SHE MIGHT WELL BE THE REIGNING TOAST OF THE DAY MISTER HEATHERSTONE ADVANCED AND MADE HIS OBEISANCE
1334-135589-0075 AND THEN HIS DAUGHTER WAS LED FORWARD AND INTRODUCED BY A LADY UNKNOWN TO EDWARD AFTER HE HAD SALUTED HER THE KING SAID LOUD ENOUGH FOR EDWARD TO HEAR
1334-135589-0076 I TRUST THAT THE DAUGHTER WILL OFTEN GRACE OUR COURT PATIENCE MADE NO REPLY BUT PASSED ON AND SOON AFTERWARD EDWARD LOST SIGHT OF HER IN THE CROWD
1334-135589-0077 AND TIME AND ABSENCE HAVE THEIR EFFECT UPON THE MOST ARDENT OF LOVERS THE SIGHT OF HER SO RESPLENDENT IN BEAUTY ACTED UPON HIM LIKE MAGIC AND HE WAS UNEASY TILL THE CEREMONY WAS OVER AND HE WAS ENABLED TO GO TO HIS SISTERS
1334-135589-0078 WHEN HE ENTERED THE ROOM HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THE ARMS OF HUMPHREY WHO HAD ARRIVED WITH THE MESSENGER AFTER THE GREETINGS WERE OVER EDWARD SAID ALICE AND I HAVE SEEN PATIENCE AND I FEAR I MUST SURRENDER AT DISCRETION
1334-135589-0079 MISTER HEATHERSTONE MAY MAKE HIS OWN TERMS I MUST WAVE ALL PRIDE RATHER THAN LOSE HER I THOUGHT THAT I HAD MORE CONTROL OVER MYSELF BUT I HAVE SEEN HER AND FEEL THAT MY FUTURE HAPPINESS DEPENDS UPON OBTAINING HER AS A WIFE
1334-135589-0080 LET HER FATHER BUT GIVE ME HER AND ARNWOOD WILL BE BUT A TRIFLE IN ADDITION WITH RESPECT TO THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH YOU ARE TO POSSESS ARNWOOD SAID HUMPHREY I CAN INFORM YOU WHAT THEY ARE
1334-135589-0081 THEY ARE WHOLLY UNSHACKLED FURTHER THAN THAT YOU ARE TO REPAY BY INSTALLMENTS THE MONEY EXPENDED IN THE BUILDING OF THE HOUSE THIS I AM EMPOWERED TO STATE TO YOU AND I THINK YOU WILL ALLOW THAT MISTER HEATHERSTONE
1334-135589-0082 HAS FULLY ACTED UP TO WHAT HE STATED WERE HIS VIEWS WHEN HE FIRST OBTAINED A GRANT OF THE PROPERTY HE HAS INDEED REPLIED EDWARD AS FOR HIS DAUGHTER EDWARD YOU HAVE YET TO WIN HER AND WEAR HER
1334-135589-0083 AS THE SAYING IS HER FATHER WILL RESIGN THE PROPERTY TO YOU AS YOURS BY RIGHT BUT YOU HAVE NO PROPERTY IN HIS DAUGHTER AND I SUSPECT THAT SHE WILL NOT BE QUITE SO EASILY HANDED OVER TO YOU
1334-135589-0084 BUT WHY SHOULD YOU SAY SO HUMPHREY HAVE WE NOT BEEN ATTACHED FROM OUR YOUTH YES IT WAS A YOUTHFUL PASSION I GRANT BUT RECOLLECT NOTHING CAME OF IT AND YEARS HAVE PASSED AWAY
1334-135589-0085 IT IS NOW SEVEN YEARS SINCE YOU QUITTED THE FOREST AND IN YOUR LETTERS TO MISTER HEATHERSTONE YOU MADE NO REMARK UPON WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN YOU AND PATIENCE SINCE THAT YOU HAVE NEVER CORRESPONDED OR SENT ANY MESSAGES
1334-135589-0086 AND YOU CAN HARDLY EXPECT THAT A GIRL FROM THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR WILL CHERISH THE IMAGE OF ONE WHO TO SAY THE LEAST HAD TREATED HER WITH INDIFFERENCE THAT IS MY VIEW OF THE MATTER EDWARD IT MAY BE WRONG
1334-135589-0087 AND IT MAY BE TRUE REPLIED EDWARD MOURNFULLY WELL
1334-135589-0088 YOU KNOW HUMPHREY HOW MANY OFFERS PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE HAS HAD AND HAS EVERY DAY I MAY SAY
1334-135589-0089 TO A PROUD BROTHER OF MINE WHO DOES NOT DESERVE HER IT MAY BE SO EDITH REPLIED HUMPHREY WOMEN ARE RIDDLES I ONLY ARGUED UPON THE COMMON SENSE OF THE THING MUCH YOU KNOW ABOUT WOMEN
1334-135589-0090 REPLIED EDITH TO BE SURE YOU DO NOT MEET MANY IN THE NEW FOREST WHERE YOU HAVE LIVED ALL YOUR LIFE VERY TRUE MY DEAR SISTER PERHAPS THAT IS THE REASON THAT THE NEW FOREST HAS HAD SUCH CHARMS FOR ME
1334-135589-0091 AFTER THAT SPEECH SIR THE SOONER YOU GET BACK AGAIN THE BETTER RETORTED EDITH BUT EDWARD MADE A SIGN TO HUMPHREY AND THEY BEAT A RETREAT HAVE YOU SEEN THE INTENDANT HUMPHREY NO
1334-135589-0092 I WAS ABOUT TO CALL UPON HIM BUT I WANTED TO SEE YOU FIRST I WILL GO WITH YOU I HAVE NOT DONE HIM JUSTICE REPLIED EDWARD AND YET I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN TO HIM SAY NOTHING BUT MEET HIM CORDIALLY
1334-135589-0093 THAT WILL BE EXPLANATION SUFFICIENT I SHALL MEET HIM AS ONE WHOM I SHALL ALWAYS REVERE
1334-135589-0094 WHAT MUST HE THINK OF MY NOT HAVING CALLED UPON HIM NOTHING YOU HOLD A PLACE AT COURT YOU MAY NOT HAVE KNOWN THAT HE WAS IN LONDON AS YOU HAVE NEVER MET HIM YOUR COMING WITH ME WILL MAKE IT APPEAR SO
1334-135589-0095 TELL HIM THAT I HAVE JUST MADE KNOWN TO YOU HIS NOBLE AND DISINTERESTED CONDUCT YOU ARE RIGHT I WILL I FEAR HOWEVER HUMPHREY THAT YOU ARE RIGHT AND EDITH WRONG AS REGARDS HIS DAUGHTER
1334-135589-0096 NAY EDWARD RECOLLECT THAT I HAVE AS EDITH OBSERVED PASSED MY LIFE IN THE WOODS EDWARD WAS MOST KINDLY RECEIVED BY MISTER HEATHERSTONE EDWARD
1334-135589-0097 ON MISTER HEATHERSTONE REPEATING TO HIM HIS INTENTIONS RELATIVE TO ARNWOOD EXPRESSED HIS SENSE OF THAT GENTLEMAN'S CONDUCT SIMPLY ADDING YOU MAY THINK ME IMPETUOUS SIR BUT I TRUST YOU WILL BELIEVE ME GRATEFUL
1334-135589-0098 PATIENCE COLORED UP AND TREMBLED WHEN EDWARD FIRST SAW HER EDWARD DID NOT REFER TO THE PAST FOR SOME TIME AFTER THEY HAD RENEWED THEIR ACQUAINTANCE HE WOOED HER AGAIN AND WON HER
1334-135589-0099 THEN ALL WAS EXPLAINED ABOUT A YEAR AFTER THE RESTORATION THERE WAS A FETE AT HAMPTON COURT GIVEN IN HONOR OF THREE MARRIAGES TAKING PLACE EDWARD BEVERLEY TO PATIENCE HEATHERSTONE CHALONER
1334-135589-0100 TO ALICE AND GRENVILLE TO EDITH AND AS HIS MAJESTY HIMSELF SAID AS HE GAVE AWAY THE BRIDES COULD LOYALTY BE BETTER REWARDED BUT OUR YOUNG READERS WILL NOT BE CONTENT IF THEY DO NOT HEAR
1334-135589-0101 SOME PARTICULARS ABOUT THE OTHER PERSONAGES WHO HAVE APPEARED IN OUR LITTLE HISTORY HUMPHREY MUST TAKE THE FIRST PLACE HIS LOVE OF FARMING CONTINUED EDWARD GAVE HIM A LARGE FARM RENT FREE
1334-135589-0102 AND IN A FEW YEARS HUMPHREY SAVED UP SUFFICIENT TO PURCHASE A PROPERTY FOR HIMSELF HE THEN MARRIED CLARA RATCLIFFE WHO HAS NOT APPEARED LATELY ON THE SCENE OWING TO HER HAVING BEEN ABOUT TWO YEARS BEFORE THE RESTORATION
1334-135589-0103 CLAIMED BY AN ELDERLY RELATION WHO LIVED IN THE COUNTRY AND WHOSE INFIRM STATE OF HEALTH DID NOT PERMIT HIM TO QUIT THE HOUSE HE LEFT HIS PROPERTY TO CLARA ABOUT A YEAR AFTER HER MARRIAGE TO HUMPHREY
1334-135589-0104 THE COTTAGE IN THE NEW FOREST WAS HELD BY AND EVENTUALLY MADE OVER TO PABLO WHO BECAME A VERY STEADY CHARACTER AND IN THE COURSE OF TIME MARRIED A YOUNG GIRL FROM ARNWOOD AND HAD A HOUSEFUL OF YOUNG GIPSIES
1334-135589-0105 OSWALD SO SOON AS EDWARD CAME DOWN TO ARNWOOD GAVE UP HIS PLACE IN THE NEW FOREST AND LIVED ENTIRELY WITH EDWARD AS HIS STEWARD AND PHOEBE ALSO WENT TO ARNWOOD AND LIVED TO A GOOD OLD AGE
1334-135589-0106 IN THE CAPACITY OF HOUSEKEEPER HER TEMPER BECOMING RATHER WORSE THAN BETTER AS SHE ADVANCED IN YEARS THIS IS ALL THAT WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT RELATIVE TO THE SEVERAL PARTIES
1355-39947-0000 PSYCHOTHERAPY AND THE COMMUNITY BOTH THE PHYSICIAN AND THE PATIENT FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE COMMUNITY THE LIFE INTERESTS OF WHICH ARE SUPERIOR TO THE INTERESTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL
1355-39947-0001 IT IS AN UNAVOIDABLE QUESTION HOW FAR FROM THE HIGHER POINT OF VIEW OF THE SOCIAL MIND THE PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFORTS SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED OR SUPPRESSED ARE THERE ANY CONDITIONS WHICH SUGGEST SUSPICION OF OR DIRECT OPPOSITION TO SUCH CURATIVE WORK
1355-39947-0002 OF COURSE SOCIETY HAS TO BE SURE THAT NO POSSIBLE MISUSE AND DAMAGE ARE TO RESULT FROM SUCH PRACTICE FEARS IN THAT DIRECTION HAVE BEEN UTTERED REPEATEDLY BUT FROM VERY DIFFERENT STANDPOINTS
1355-39947-0003 ONE WHICH IS PERHAPS MOST OFTEN HEARD IN POPULAR CIRCLES RESULTS FROM AN ENTIRE MISUNDERSTANDING AND DESERVES HARDLY ANY DISCUSSION AFTER OUR DETAILED STUDY OF THE PROCESSES INVOLVED IT IS CLAIMED THAT SUGGESTIVE POWER ESPECIALLY IN THE FORM OF
1355-39947-0004 HYPNOTIZATION MAY BE SECRETLY MISUSED TO MAKE ANYONE WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE AND AGAINST HIS WILL A PASSIVE INSTRUMENT OF THE HYPNOTIST'S INTENT OFTEN THIS IS COUPLED WITH TELEPATHIC FANCIES
1355-39947-0005 THE HYPNOTIST IS BELIEVED TO HAVE MYSTIC POWER TO BRING ANY PERSON IN A DISTANT REGION UNDER HIS MENTAL CONTROL AND THUS TO BE ABLE TO CARRY OUT ANY SINISTER PLANS BY THE HELP OF HIS INNOCENT VICTIM ALL HYPNOTIZING THEREFORE OUGHT TO BE INTERDICTED BY THE STATE
1355-39947-0006 THE PRESUPPOSITIONS OF SUCH A VIEW ARE AS WE KNOW NOW ENTIRELY ABSURD WE KNOW THAT HYPNOTISM IS NOT BASED ON ANY SPECIAL POWER OF THE HYPNOTIZER THERE IS NO MAGNETIC FLUID IN THE SENSE OF THE OLD MESMERISM
1355-39947-0007 THE IMAGINATION OF THE HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS THE ONLY HYPNOTIZING AGENCY THUS NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED WITHOUT HIS KNOWLEDGE OR AGAINST HIS WILL THE STORY OF TELEPATHIC MYSTERIES WHICH IS OFTEN BROUGHT BEFORE THE PUBLIC
1355-39947-0008 IS PROBABLY ALWAYS THE OUTCOME OF A DISEASED BRAIN IT IS INDEED A FREQUENT SYMPTOM IN PARANOIA AND OTHER INSANITIES THAT THE PATIENT WHO FEELS ABNORMAL ORGANIC SENSATIONS AND ABNORMAL UNACCOUNTABLE IMPULSES INTERPRETS THEM AS INFLUENCES OF A DISTANT ENEMY
1355-39947-0009 WHOLE PAMPHLETS HAVE BEEN WRITTEN WITH ELABORATION OF SUCH INSANE MISINTERPRETATIONS AND REQUESTS TO LEGISLATURES HAVE BEEN MADE IN THAT SPIRIT BUT THE PHYSICIAN RECOGNIZES EASILY THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE ARGUMENTATION THE WELL KNOWN PHENOMENA OF THE MENTAL DISEASE
1355-39947-0010 TO BE SURE WHILE NO ONE CAN BE HYPNOTIZED AGAINST HIS WILL MANY A PERSON IS LIABLE TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS FROM OTHERS AND THUS TO CARRY OUT THE WISHES OF OTHERS ALMOST WITHOUT KNOWING AND CERTAINLY WITHOUT WILLING THAT THE OTHER MIND INTERFERE WITH THE INTERPLAY OF THE OWN MOTIVES
1355-39947-0011 BUT IF WE WERE TO STRIKE OUT ALL SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCES FROM SOCIAL LIFE WE SHOULD GIVE UP SOCIAL LIFE ITSELF SUGGESTION IS GIVEN WHEREVER MEN COME IN CONTACT IN ITSELF IT IS NEITHER GOOD NOR BAD THE GOOD RESOLUTION AND THE BAD ONE CAN BE SUGGESTED
1355-39947-0012 THE GOOD EXAMPLE AND THE BAD CAN BE EFFECTIVE BOTH ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE NOBLE AND IMITATION OF THE EVIL MAY WORK WITH THE SAME MENTAL TECHNIQUE CERTAINLY THERE ARE SOME PERSONS WHO HAVE A STRONGER INFLUENCE THAN OTHERS ON THE IMAGINATION OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY COME IN CONTACT
1355-39947-0013 THEIR EXPRESSION AWAKENS CONFIDENCE THEIR VOICE AND THEIR WORDS REACH DEEPER LAYERS OF THE MIND THEIR CALMNESS AND FIRMNESS OVERWHELM MORE EASILY THE ANTAGONISTIC IDEAS
1355-39947-0014 BUT THE CHIEF DIFFERENCE LIES AFTER ALL IN THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF SUGGESTIBILITY AMONG THOSE WHO RECEIVE SUCH IMPRESSIONS THE EASILY SUGGESTIBLE PERSON CANNOT BE PROTECTED BY ANY INTERDICT HE MAY CATCH SUGGESTIONS EVERYWHERE
1355-39947-0015 ANY ADVERTISEMENT IN THE NEWSPAPER AND ANY DISPLAY IN THE SHOP WINDOW MAY OVERRUN HIS OWN INTENTIONS WHAT HE NEEDS IS TRAINING IN FIRMNESS THE APPLICATION OF REENFORCED SUGGESTION OR EVEN OF HYPNOTISM IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE IS EVEN FOR HIM
1355-39947-0016 NO POSSIBLE SOURCE OF DANGER ON A HIGHER LEVEL ARE OBJECTIONS WHICH COME FROM SERIOUS QUARTERS AND WHICH ARE NOT WITHOUT SYMPATHY WITH TRUE SCIENCE IN RECENT TIMES THIS OPPOSITION HAS REPEATEDLY FOUND ELOQUENT EXPRESSION IT IS AN OBJECTION FROM THE STANDPOINT OF MORALITY
1355-39947-0017 BELONGING THEREFORE ENTIRELY TO THE PURPOSIVE VIEW OF THE MIND BUT WE HAVE NOW REACHED A POINT WHERE IT IS OUR DUTY TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS PURPOSIVE VIEW TOO AS LONG AS WE DISCUSSED THE PROBLEM ENTIRELY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0018 NO OTHER VIEW OF MENTAL LIFE EXCEPT THE CAUSAL ONE COULD BE IN QUESTION AS SOON AS WE LOOK AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE COMMUNITY IT BECOMES OUR DUTY TO BRING THE CAUSAL AND THE PURPOSIVE VIEW INTO HARMONY AND IT WOULD BE NARROW AND SHORT SIGHTED SIMPLY TO
1355-39947-0019 DRAW THE PRACTICAL CONSEQUENCES OF A NATURALISTIC VIEW OF THE MIND WITHOUT INQUIRING WHETHER OR NOT SERIOUS INTERESTS IN THE PURPOSIVE SPHERE ARE INJURED IF THERE IS MORAL CRITICISM AGAINST SUGGESTIVE THERAPY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE COMMUNITY TO CONSIDER IT
1355-39947-0020 THIS OPPOSITION ARGUES AS FOLLOWS HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE BRINGS THE PATIENT UNDER THE WILL CONTROL OF THE HYPNOTIZER AND THUS DESTROYS HIS OWN FREEDOM WHATEVER THE PATIENT MAY REACH IN THE ALTERED STATES IS REACHED WITHOUT HIS OWN EFFORT WHILE HE IS THE PASSIVE RECEIVER
1355-39947-0021 HIS ACHIEVEMENT HAS THEREFORE NO MORAL VALUE AND IF HE IS REALLY CURED OF HIS DRUNKENNESS OR OF HIS PERVERSE HABITS OF HIS MISUSE OF COCAINE OR OF HIS CRIMINAL TENDENCIES HE HAS LOST THE RIGHT TO BE COUNTED A MORAL AGENT IT WOULD BE BETTER
1355-39947-0022 IF THERE WERE MORE SUFFERING IN THE WORLD THAN THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE MORAL WILL SHOULD BE UNDERMINED NO ONE OUGHT TO TAKE SUCH ARGUMENTS LIGHTLY THE SPIRIT WHICH DIRECTS THEM IS NEEDED MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE IN OUR TIME OF REACHING OUT FOR SUPERFICIAL GOODS
1355-39947-0023 NO ONE CAN INSIST TOO EARNESTLY THAT LIFE IS WORTH LIVING ONLY IF IT SERVES MORAL DUTIES AND MORAL FREEDOM AND IS NOT DETERMINED BY PLEASURES AND ABSENCE OF PAIN ONLY THOSE WHO SET FORTH THIS ARGUMENT ARE ENTIRELY WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE
1355-39947-0024 PROFOUND EFFECT WHICH SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MAY CREATE MORE THAN THIS THEY HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT TO GAIN A BASIS FOR THEIR ATTACK JUST BECAUSE THE HYPNOTIZER CAN ENTIRELY CHANGE THE DESIRES AND PASSIONS THE HABITS AND PERVERSITIES OF THE SUFFERING VICTIM
1355-39947-0025 HE SEEMS TO THEM A MORAL WRONGDOER WHO NEGATES THE PRINCIPLE OF HUMAN FREEDOM A FORCIBLE BOOK OF RECENT DAYS CALLS THE SUGGESTIVE POWER OF THE PSYCHOTHERAPIST THE GREAT PSYCHOLOGICAL CRIME IT SAYS TO THE HYPNOTIST
1355-39947-0026 BY YOUR OWN TESTIMONY YOU STAND CONVICTED OF APPLYING A PROCESS WHICH DEPRIVES YOUR SUBJECTS OF THE INALIENABLE RIGHT AND POWER OF INDIVIDUAL SELF CONTROL IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE POWER OF SELF CONTROL
1355-39947-0027 YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THAT UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND IN PROPORTION AS YOU DEPRIVE HIM OF THE FREE CONTROL AND EXERCISE OF THOSE POWERS OF THE SOUL UPON WHICH HIS INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY AND MORAL STATUS DEPEND
1355-39947-0028 YOU THEREBY ROB HIM OF THOSE POWERS UPON WHICH HE MUST DEPEND FOR THE ACHIEVEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL IMMORTALITY BUT THIS CENSURE TOO IS ENTIRELY MISTAKEN NOT BECAUSE IT URGES THE PURPOSIVE VIEWS AGAINST THE CAUSAL
1355-39947-0029 BUT BECAUSE IT IS IN ERROR AS TO THE FACTS SUCH CRITICS ARE FULLY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE STARTLING RESULTS WHICH ARE REACHED THEY DO NOT TAKE THE TROUBLE TO EXAMINE THE LONG AND DIFFICULT WAY WHICH HAS HAD TO BE TRAVERSED WITH PATIENCE AND ENERGY
1355-39947-0030 IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT IF I HYPNOTIZE A MAN AND SUGGEST TO HIM TO TAKE UP AFTER AWAKING THE BOOK WHICH LIES ON MY TABLE HE FOLLOWS MY SUGGESTION WITHOUT CONFLICT AND IN A CERTAIN SENSE WITHOUT FREEDOM HE FEELS A SIMPLE IMPULSE TO GO TO THE TABLE AND LIFT THE BOOK AND
1355-39947-0031 AS NO STRONGER NATURAL DESIRE AND NO MORAL OBJECTION STAND IN THE WAY HE CARRIES OUT THAT MEANINGLESS IMPULSE AND PERHAPS EVEN INVENTS A FOOLISH MOTIVE TO EXPLAIN TO HIMSELF WHY HE WANTED TO LOOK AT THAT BOOK
1355-39947-0032 BUT AFTER A LONG EXPERIENCE I HAVE MY DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER A MAN WAS EVER CURED IN SUCH A WAY BY HYPNOTISM OF SERIOUS DISTURBANCES AND OF THOSE ANOMALOUS ACTIONS WHICH THE CRITICS WANT TO SEE OVERCOME BY THE PATIENT'S OWN MORAL EFFORTS ON THE CONTRARY
1355-39947-0033 EVERY SUGGESTION HAS TO RELY ON THE EFFORTS AND STRUGGLES OF THE PATIENT HIMSELF AND ALL THAT THE PSYCHOTHERAPISTS CAN GIVE HIM IS HELP IN HIS OWN MORAL FIGHT HIS OWN WILL IS PRESUPPOSITION FOR BEING HYPNOTIZED
1355-39947-0034 IF AGAIN AND AGAIN I HESITATE TO UNDERTAKE NEW CASES IT IS JUST BECAUSE I HAVE TO SEE DURING THE TREATMENT TOO MUCH OF THIS DAILY AND HOURLY STRIVING AGAINST OVERPOWERING IMPULSES THE JOY OF REMOVING SOME OBSTACLES FROM THE WAY OF THE PATIENTS
1355-39947-0035 IS TOO MUCH OVERSHADOWED BY THE DEEP PITY AND SYMPATHY WITH THEIR SUFFERING AND CRAVING DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF SUCCESSIVE TREATMENTS TO MAKE A MAN FIGHT WHERE DESPAIR IS INEVITABLE AND WHERE THE ENEMY IS NECESSARILY STRONGER THAN HIS OWN POWERS CAN CERTAINLY NOT BE THE MORAL DEMAND
1355-39947-0036 MORALITY POSTULATES THAT EVERYONE FIND CONDITIONS IN WHICH HE CAN BE VICTORIOUS IF HE PUTS HIS STRONGEST EFFORTS TO THE TASK IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THE MENTAL SYMPTOMS I REPORTED AS AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE SUGGESTIVE TREATMENT OF THE DRUG PASSION
1355-39947-0037 THE CASE OF A MORPHINIST TO MAKE CLEAR THIS PURPOSIVE SIDE OF THE CASE AS AGAINST THE CAUSAL ONE WHICH ALONE INTERESTED THE PHYSICIAN I MAY ADD A FEW FEATURES TO THE SHORT REPORT AS A TYPICAL EXAMPLE
1355-39947-0038 WHEN THAT MAN LEFT MY LABORATORY FOR THE LAST TIME TO GO OUT TO WORK AND HAPPINESS YOU MIGHT WELL HAVE BELIEVED FROM HIS JOYFUL FACE THAT IT HAD BEEN AN EASY AND PLEASANT TIME IN WHICH HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE SMOOTHLY REMOVED FROM HIM THE DANGEROUS DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0039 IN TRUTH IT WAS THE RESULT OF FOUR MONTHS OF THE MOST NOBLE AND COURAGEOUS SUFFERING AND STRUGGLING HE HAD BEEN FOR YEARS A SLAVE TO HIS PASSION TO QUOTE FROM HIS LITTLE AUTOBIOGRAPHY WHEN I REALIZED THAT I WAS ADDICTED TO MORPHINE
1355-39947-0040 THAT IS COMING TO ANYONE WHO IS THE USER OF OPIUM OR ANY OF ITS ALKALOIDS FOR THE FIRST FEW MONTHS I FOUND GREAT RELIEF AFTER EVERY INJECTION OF MORPHINE BUT SOON I COULD NOT GET THE SAME EASY FEELING AND COULD EAT BUT VERY LITTLE AND WHAT SLEEP I GOT WAS IN THE DAYTIME
1355-39947-0041 I FINALLY WENT TO THE SANITARIUM OF A DOCTOR
1355-39947-0042 WHEN I FIRST WENT TO SEE THE PROFESSOR IN THE HARVARD PSYCHOLOGICAL LABORATORY I WAS USING BETWEEN THIRTY TWO AND THIRTY EIGHT GRAINS OF MORPHINE DAILY HE PUT ME UNDER HIS TREATMENT OCTOBER SIXTH AND THAT DAY CUT ME DOWN BY HYPNOTIC TREATMENT TO NINE GRAINS A DAY OR
1355-39947-0043 THREE DOSES OF THREE GRAINS A DAY I TOOK MY HYPODERMIC AS DIRECTED BUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY I LAY ON THE BED TOO EXHAUSTED TO GET UP EVEN TO GET AROUND THE ROOM AND I COULD NOT EAT
1355-39947-0044 THE DESIRE FOR THE DRUG WAS SOMETHING TERRIBLE BUT IN ABOUT FOUR DAYS I GOT USED TO THE LOSS OF SO MUCH MORPHINE AND STAYED ON THIS AMOUNT FOR A WEEK SEEING THE PROFESSOR EVERY OTHER DAY FOR HYPNOTIC TREATMENT AND THEN RETURNING TO MY ROOM WHERE I SPENT TWENTY TWO HOURS OF THE TWENTY FOUR ON THE BED
1355-39947-0045 BUT DID NOT SLEEP MORE THAN TWO OR THREE HOURS A DAY
1355-39947-0046 I WAS CUT OFF BY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION HALF A GRAIN AND THIS PUT ME TO FIGHTING THE DESIRE AGAIN
1355-39947-0047 THESE REDUCTIONS OF THE DOSE WERE MADE A WEEK APART AND SOMETIMES ONLY TWO DAYS THE WORST TIME OF ALL WAS A CUT FROM FOUR INJECTIONS OF A FOURTH OF A GRAIN EACH TO FOUR OF ONE EIGHTH OF A GRAIN EACH WHICH WAS ABOUT JANUARY TENTH
1355-39947-0048 AT THIS TIME I HAD THE WORST TWO DAYS OF MY LIFE I TRIED WHISKEY BUT IT GAVE RELIEF ONLY FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AND THEN THE DESIRE WAS WORSE THAN EVER
1355-39947-0049 HE WAS THUS AT EVERY MOMENT DURING THE DAY AND NIGHT IN FULL POSSESSION OF THE DEADLY POISON WITH WHICH HE COULD HAVE FULLY SATISFIED HIS CRAVING IT WAS A MORAL VICTORY WHEN HE FINALLY REACHED THE POINT AT WHICH HE WENT FOR SEVERAL WEEKS WITHOUT ANY DESIRE FOR MORPHINE
1355-39947-0050 AND FINALLY PRESENTED THE REMAINING TABLETS TO A HOSPITAL AND YET THERE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE LEAST CHANCE FOR HIS WINNING THIS ETHICAL VICTORY WITHOUT THE OUTER HELP OF THE HYPNOTIST WE DO NOT ELIMINATE THE MORAL WILL BUT WE REMOVE SOME UNFAIR OBSTACLES FROM ITS PATH
1355-39947-0051 WE HAVE NO MYSTIC POWER BY WHICH OUR WILL SIMPLY TAKES HOLD OF THE OTHER MAN'S WILL BUT WE INHIBIT AND SUPPRESS BY INFLUENCE ON THE IMAGINATION THOSE ABNORMAL IMPULSES WHICH RESIST THE SOUND DESIRES IF THAT WERE IMMORAL
1355-39947-0052 WE SHOULD HAVE TO MAKE UP OUR MINDS THAT ALL EDUCATION AND TRAINING WERE PERVERTED WITH SUCH IMMORAL ELEMENTS EVERY SOUND RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY WHICH MAKES A CHILD WILLING TO ACCEPT THE ADVICE AND MAXIMS OF HIS ELDERS IS JUST SUCH AN INFLUENCE
1355-39947-0053 IF IT WERE REALLY A MORAL DEMAND THAT THE WILL BE LEFT TO ITS OWN RESOURCES AND THAT NO OUTSIDE INFLUENCE COME TO STRENGTHEN ITS POWER OR REMOVE ITS HINDRANCES OR SMOOTH ITS PATH THEN WE OUGHT TO LET THE CHILDREN GROW UP AS NATURE CREATED THEM
1355-39947-0054 AND OUGHT NOT TO TRY TO SUPPRESS FROM WITHOUT BY DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING BY LOVE AND ENCOURAGEMENT THE WILLFUL IMPULSES AND THE UGLY HABITS EVEN EVERY GOOD MODEL FOR IMITATION IS SUCH A SUGGESTIVE INFLUENCE FROM WITHOUT AND EVERY SOLEMN APPEAL TO LOYALTY AND FRIENDSHIP
1355-39947-0055 TO PATRIOTISM AND RELIGION INCREASES THE DEGREE OF SUGGESTIBILITY THAT IS THE GLORY OF LIFE THAT THE SUGGESTIVE POWER MAY BELONG TO MORAL VALUES INSTEAD OF MERE PLEASURES BUT IT IS NOT THE AIM OF LIFE TO REMAIN UNTOUCHED BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0056 AND HE WHO BY SUGGESTION HELPS THE WEAK MIND TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES WHICH THE STRONG MIND CAN OVERTHROW FROM ITS INBORN RESOURCES WORKS FOR THE GOOD OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND OF THE COMMUNITY IN THE SPIRIT OF TRUEST MORALITY MUCH MORE JUSTIFIED THAN SUCH
1355-39947-0057 ETHICAL OBJECTIONS ARE THE FEARS WHICH MOVE ENTIRELY IN THE CAUSAL SPHERE IT MUST BE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT A METHOD WHICH HAS SUCH POWERFUL INFLUENCE OVER THE MIND THAT IT CAN SECURE IDEAS AND EMOTIONS AND IMPULSES WHICH THE OWN WILL OF THE PATIENT CANNOT PRODUCE
1355-39947-0058 OUGHT TO BE ALLOWED ONLY TO THOSE WHO ARE PREPARED FOR ITS SKILLFUL USE TO HYPNOTIZE OR TO PERFORM ANY PERSISTENT PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC TREATMENT MAY THUS BE DANGEROUS IF IT IS DONE BY THE UNFIT
1355-39947-0059 WE HAVE DISCUSSED BEFORE THE INJURIES WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM THE ADMINISTRATION OF SUCH POWERFUL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC EFFECTS THROUGH THE BEST MEANING MINISTER BUT WE CAN EXTEND THIS FEAR TO ANYONE WHO HAS NOT SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED MEDICINE AND TO A CERTAIN DEGREE NORMAL AND ABNORMAL PSYCHOLOGY
1355-39947-0060 THE POSSIBILITIES OF OVERLOOKING SYMPTOMS WHICH OUGHT TO SUGGEST AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT TREATMENT OR OF ADJUSTING THE TREATMENT BADLY TO THE SPECIAL PHYSICAL CONDITIONS OR OF IGNORING THE DESIRABLE PHYSICAL SUPPLEMENT BY DRUGS OR OF CREATING UNINTENTIONALLY BY SUGGESTION
1355-39947-0061 INJURIOUS EFFECTS ARE ALWAYS OPEN WHEN MEDICAL AMATEURS UNDERTAKE SUCH WORK CERTAINLY THERE IS NO PHYSICIAN WHO IS NOT LIABLE TO MAKE MISTAKES AND A PHYSICIAN WHO HAS NEVER GIVEN ANY ATTENTION TO PSYCHOLOGY AND PSYCHIATRY
1355-39947-0062 WOULD ALSO BE A RATHER POOR AGENT OF PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS BUT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT SUCH A PHYSICIAN WOULD SIMPLY ABSTAIN BY PRINCIPLE FROM ALL PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC METHODS HIS MISTAKE ONLY BEGINS IF FROM HIS LACK OF ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE SUBJECT
1355-39947-0063 HE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT THE METHOD ITSELF IS UNDESIRABLE THAT HIS REAL PREPARATION OUGHT TO INCLUDE PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES WE HAVE POINTED OUT BEFORE AND THE TIME SEEMS RIPE FOR THE COMMUNITY TO URGE SUCH A REFORM OF THE STUDIES
1355-39947-0064 ALL THAT INVOLVES THE CONVICTION THAT EVEN THE EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGIST AS SUCH IS NOT PREPARED TO ENTER INTO MEDICAL TREATMENT AND A PSYCHOLOGICAL CLINIC MANAGED BY A PSYCHOLOGIST WHO IS NOT A DOCTOR OF MEDICINE
1355-39947-0065 IS CERTAINLY NOT BETTER THAN A CHURCH CLINIC I CANNOT EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE RIGHT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS MERELY FOR THE PSYCHOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT'S SAKE NOBODY OUGHT TO BE BROUGHT INTO A HYPNOTIC OR OTHERWISE ABNORMAL STATE OF MIND
1355-39947-0066 IF IT IS NOT SUGGESTED BY THE INTERESTS OF THE SUBJECT HIMSELF SCIENCE HAS THE RIGHT TO MAKE HYPNOTIC EXPERIMENTS OR EXPERIMENTS WITH ABNORMAL MENTAL STATES ONLY UNDER THE ONE CONDITION THAT A PHYSICIAN HAS HYPNOTIZED THE SUBJECT IN THE INTERESTS OF HIS HEALTH
1355-39947-0067 AND THAT THE PATIENT HAS AGREED BEFOREHAND TO ALLOW IN THE PRESENCE OF WITNESSES CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDIES NEEDLESS TO SAY THAT ANY HYPNOTIZATION FOR MERE AMUSEMENT AND AS A PARLOR TRICK OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED AS
1355-39947-0068 CRIMINAL ON SOME OTHER OBJECTIONS WHICH INTEREST THE COMMUNITY AS SUCH WE HAD TO TOUCH BEFORE AND THERE IS NO NEED OF RETURNING TO THEM WITH ANY FULLNESS OF ARGUMENT WE SPOKE OF THE DANGER WHICH THE MENTAL CURES CARRY WITH THEM WHEN THEY ARE BASED ON ANY PARTICULAR CREED
1355-39947-0069 WHAT IS GAINED IF SOME NERVOUS DISORDERS ARE HELPED BY BELIEF IF THE BELIEF ITSELF DEVASTATES OUR INTELLECTUAL CULTURE AND BRINGS THE MASSES DOWN AGAIN TO A VIEW OF THE WORLD WHICH HAS ALL THE EARMARKS OF BARBARISM
1355-39947-0070 THAT IS INDEED ONE OF THE CENTRAL DANGERS OF ALL NON MEDICAL SUGGESTIVE CURES THAT WHILE ANY BELIEF MAY CURE THROUGH THE MERE EMOTIONAL POWER OF THE ACT OF BELIEVING THE CONTENT OF THE BELIEF GAINS AN UNDESERVED APPEARANCE OF TRUTH
1355-39947-0071 ANY ABSURD SUPERSTITION CAN BECOME ACCREDITED BECAUSE ITS CURATIVE VALUE MAY BE EQUAL TO A TRULY VALUABLE SUGGESTION THE INTELLECTUAL LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE TO SUFFER GREATLY IF THE WAY TO BE FREED FROM BODILY SUFFERING
1355-39947-0072 HAD TO BE THE BELIEF IN THE METAPHYSICAL DOCTRINES OF MISSUS EDDY'S SCIENCE AND HEALTH FROM A CULTURAL VIEWPOINT TOO SUGGESTIVE THERAPEUTICS MUST STAND THE HIGHER THE MORE SHARPLY IT IS SEPARATED FROM SPECIAL PHILOSOPHICAL OR RELIGIOUS DOCTRINES
1355-39947-0073 NO THEORY OF THE WORLD AND OF GOD OUGHT TO GAIN AUTHORITY OVER THE MIND FROM SUCH AN EXTERNAL MOTIVE AS A BELIEF IN ITS CURATIVE EFFECTS FREEST FROM SUCH IMPLICATIONS IS CERTAINLY THE HYPNOTIC METHOD OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0074 WHO DOES NOT NEED THE STRONG RELIGIOUS REENFORCEMENT OF THE SUGGESTION BECAUSE HE REENFORCES INSTEAD THE SUGGESTIBILITY OF THE PATIENT BY SLIGHT INFLUENCES ON HIS SENSES
1355-39947-0075 EVEN WHERE SOUND RELIGION WITHOUT SUPERSTITION AND WITHOUT PSEUDOPHILOSOPHY STANDS BEHIND THE THERAPEUTIC WORK THE COMMUNITY WILL NOT GIVE UP THE QUESTION WHETHER THE CHURCH DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEGLECT BY IT THE INTERESTS WHICH ARE SUPERIOR
1355-39947-0076 THE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE AND MORE STRONGLY AWARE THAT TOO MANY FACTORS OF OUR MODERN SOCIETY URGE THE CHURCH TO UNDERTAKE NON RELIGIOUS WORK SOCIAL AID AND CHARITY WORK OUGHT TO BE FILLED WITH RELIGIOUS SPIRIT
1355-39947-0077 STILL MORE THAT IS TRUE OF THE HEALING OF THE SICK WHETHER OR NOT SUCH EXPANSION OF CHURCH ACTIVITY IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SAPS THE VITAL STRENGTH OF RELIGION ITSELF IS INDEED A PROBLEM FOR THE WHOLE COMMUNITY
1355-39947-0078 THE FEAR SUGGESTS ITSELF THAT THE SPIRITUAL ACHIEVEMENT MAY BECOME HAMPERED THAT IN THE COMPETITION OF THE CHURCH WITH THE OTHER AGENCIES OF SOCIAL LIFE THE PARTICULAR CHURCH TASK MAY BE PUSHED TO THE BACKGROUND AND THAT THUS THE CHURCH
1355-39947-0079 IN IMITATING THAT WHICH OTHERS CAN DO JUST AS WELL OR BETTER LOSES THE POWER TO DO THAT WHICH THE CHURCH ALONE CAN DO THE FINAL OUTCOME IS THEREFORE PRACTICALLY IN EVERY WAY THE SAME FROM WHATEVER STARTING POINT WE MAY COME WE ARE LED TO THE CONVICTION
1355-39947-0080 THAT THE PHYSICIAN ALONE IS CALLED TO ADMINISTER PSYCHOTHERAPEUTIC WORK BUT THAT HE NEEDS A THOROUGH PSYCHOLOGICAL TRAINING BESIDES HIS MEDICAL ONE BUT THE INTEREST OF THE COMMUNITY IS NOT ONLY A NEGATIVE ONE
1355-39947-0081 SOCIETY DOES NOT ONLY ASK WHERE PSYCHICAL TREATMENT CAN BE DANGEROUS BUT ASKS WITH NOT LESS RIGHT WHETHER THE SCHEME AND THE METHOD MIGHT NOT BE FRUCTIFIED FOR OTHER SOCIAL ENDS BESIDES THE MERE HEALING OF THE SICK IF PSYCHOTHERAPY DEMONSTRATES THAT FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0082 HYPNOTISM MAKES POSSIBLE THE RESHAPING OF A PATHOLOGICAL MIND IT IS A NATURAL THOUGHT TO USE THE SAME POWER FOR REMODELING PERHAPS THE LAZY OR THE INTEMPERATE THE CARELESS OR THE INATTENTIVE THE DISHONEST OR THE CRIMINAL MIND
1355-39947-0083 BOTH EDUCATORS AND CRIMINOLOGISTS HAVE INDEED OFTEN RAISED SUCH QUESTIONS AND SOCIAL REFORMERS HAVE NOT SELDOM SEEN THERE WIDE PERSPECTIVES FOR SOCIAL MOVEMENTS IN FUTURE TIMES
1355-39947-0084 THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH REMODELING ACTIVITY IS GIVEN BUT AS FAR AS EDUCATION IS CONCERNED CERTAINLY GRAVE MISGIVINGS OUGHT TO BE FELT WHEN WE SPOKE OF THE TREATMENT OF THE SICK
1355-39947-0085 WE HAD ALWAYS TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE SUGGESTION CURES SYMPTOMS BUT NOT DISEASES IN THE SAME WAY HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION MIGHT REENFORCE A SINGLE TRAIT BUT WOULD NOT REFORM THE PERSONALITY OF THE CHILD
1355-39947-0086 YES THE ARTIFICIAL REENFORCEMENT OF SUCH SPECIAL FEATURES WOULD DEPRIVE EDUCATION OF THAT WHICH IS THE MOST ESSENTIAL NAMELY THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE POWER TO OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES BY OWN ENERGY
1355-39947-0087 WHEREVER A REASONABLE AMOUNT OF OWN WILL FORCE AND ATTENTION CAN BE EXPECTED TO OVERCOME THE ANTAGONISTIC INFLUENCE THERE ARTIFICIAL HYPNOTIC INFLUENCE OUGHT TO BE AVOIDED EVERYTHING OUGHT TO BE LEFT IN THAT CASE TO SUGGESTIONS WITHIN NORMAL LIMITS
1355-39947-0088 IN THE FORM OF GOOD EXAMPLE AND PERSUASIONS AUTHORITY AND DISCIPLINE LOVE AND SYMPATHY THAT HOLDS TRUE EVEN FOR VERY SLIGHT ABNORMALITIES WHICH SEEM STILL WITHIN THE LIMITS WHERE THE OWN ENERGIES CAN BRING ABOUT THE CURE FOR INSTANCE
1355-39947-0089 I HAVE STEADILY REFUSED REQUESTS OF STUDENTS AND OTHERS TO USE HYPNOTISM FOR THE PURPOSE OF OVERCOMING MERELY BAD HABITS SUCH AS THE HABIT OF BITING THE NAILS A CHILD WHO FINDS SOME DIFFICULTY IN STICKING SERIOUSLY TO HIS TASKS MIGHT LEARN NOW THIS
1355-39947-0090 AND NOW THAT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS BUT HE WOULD REMAIN ENTIRELY UNTRAINED FOR MASTERING THE NEXT LESSON IN THE SAME WAY SOME NAUGHTY TRAITS MIGHT BE ARTIFICIALLY REMOVED BUT THE CHILD WOULD NOT GAIN ANYTHING TOWARDS THE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT POWER
1355-39947-0091 OF SUPPRESSING AN UGLY TENDENCY BY HIS OWN EFFORT ALL THAT FINDS ITS LIMITS WHERE THE INHIBITIONS OR OBSTACLES IN THE BRAIN OF THE CHILD ARE TOO STRONG POSSIBLY TO BE OVERCOME BY THE OWN GOOD WILL BUT IN THAT CASE
1355-39947-0092 PSYCHOTHERAPY HAS ITS RIGHT THE FEEBLE MINDED AND THE RETARDED CHILD THE PERVERSE CHILD AND THE EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE CHILD BELONG UNDER THE CARE OF THE PHYSICIAN
1355-39947-0093 WHICH ARE AT HIS DISPOSAL STILL MORE COMPLEX IS THE CRIMINOLOGICAL PROBLEM IT SOUNDS LIKE AN EASY REMEDY FOR THE GREATEST SOCIAL CALAMITY IF IT IS PROPOSED SIMPLY TO HYPNOTIZE THE CRIMINAL AND TO SUPPLANT HIS ANTISOCIAL WILL BY A MORAL ONE
1355-39947-0094 AND IF THE ABSURDITY OF SUCH A PROPOSAL IS RECOGNIZED IT SEEMS TO MANY JUSTIFIED TO DEMAND SUCH AN INTRUSION AT LEAST IN THE CASE OF THE BORN CRIMINAL EVEN IF THE OCCASIONAL CRIMINAL CANNOT BE REACHED
1355-39947-0095 BUT THE CONCEPTION OF THE BORN CRIMINAL IS ALSO ONLY A LABEL WHICH IS SUPERFICIALLY USED FOR A GREAT VARIETY OF MINDS THAT MEN ARE BORN WITH A BRAIN WHICH NECESSARILY PRODUCES CRIMINAL ACTIONS IS NOT INDICATED BY ANY FACTS
1355-39947-0096 THE VARIETIES WHICH NATURE REALLY PRODUCES ARE BRAINS WHICH ARE MORE LIABLE THAN OTHERS TO PRODUCE ANTISOCIAL ACTIONS WE RECOGNIZED FROM THE START THAT THE ABNORMAL MIND NEVER INTRODUCES ANY NEW ELEMENTS BUT IS CHARACTERIZED ONLY BY A CHANGE OF PROPORTIONS
1355-39947-0097 THERE IS TOO MUCH OR TOO LITTLE OF A CERTAIN MENTAL PROCESS AND JUST FOR THAT REASON THERE MUST BE A STEADY AND CONTINUOUS TRANSITION FROM THE NORMAL TO THE ENTIRELY ABNORMAL
1363-135842-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY FOUR UNC BILLY AND OLD MISSUS POSSUM
1363-135842-0001 ALL THE WAY HOME FROM SCHOOL PETER RABBIT DID HIS BEST TO THINK WHO IT COULD BE WHO ATE FLESH YET WASN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
1363-135842-0002 EVERY FEW HOPS HE WOULD STOP TO THINK BUT ALL HIS STOPPING AND ALL HIS THINKING WERE IN VAIN AND WHEN HE STARTED FOR SCHOOL THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS AS PUZZLED AS EVER
1363-135842-0003 ON HIS WAY THROUGH THE GREEN FOREST HE PASSED A CERTAIN TREE HE WAS JUST PAST AND NO MORE WHEN A FAMILIAR VOICE HAILED HIM
1363-135842-0004 WHAT'S YO HURRY PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY AND LOOKED UP IN THAT TREE THERE PEERING DOWN AT HIM FROM A HOLE HIGH UP IN THE TRUNK WAS A SHARP WHITISH GRAY FACE
1363-135842-0005 WITH A PAIR OF TWINKLING BLACK EYES HELLO UNC BILLY CRIED PETER HOW ARE YOU AND OL MISSUS POSSUM PO'LY PETER PO'LY
1363-135842-0006 WE UNS HAVEN'T HAD BREAKFAST YET SO WE UNS ARE FEELING PO'LY REPLIED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN A SUDDEN THOUGHT POPPED INTO PETER'S HEAD
1363-135842-0007 UNC POKED HIS HEAD A LITTLE FARTHER OUT AND PUT HIS HAND BEHIND HIS EAR AS IF HE WERE A LITTLE HARD OF HEARING
1363-135842-0008 AM I A WHAT HE DEMANDED
1363-135842-0009 REPEATED PETER AH RECKONS AH MIGHT BE IF AH KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT AS LONG AS AH DON'T
1363-135842-0010 MISTER OPOSSUM BUT PETER WASN'T LISTENING THE FACT IS PETER HAD STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR SCHOOL WITHOUT EVEN BEING POLITE ENOUGH TO SAY GOOD BY HE ARRIVED AT SCHOOL QUITE OUT OF BREATH
1363-135842-0011 WHAT DO YOU KNOW ASKED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0012 YET DOESN'T BELONG TO THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS
1363-135842-0013 CRIED PETER RIGHT YOU ARE REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE HOWEVER DID YOU FIND IT OUT I DIDN'T EXACTLY FIND IT OUT I GUESSED IT REPLIED PETER
1363-135842-0014 ON MY WAY HERE I SAW UNC BILLY AND IT POPPED INTO MY HEAD RIGHT AWAY THAT HE WAS ONE WE HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT AND MUST BE THE ONE BUT IF HE EATS FLESH
1363-135842-0015 I DON'T SEE WHY HE ISN'T A MEMBER OF THE ORDER OF FLESH EATERS IT IS BECAUSE HE BELONGS TO A GROUP WHICH HAS SOMETHING WHICH MAKES THEM ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER ANIMALS AND FOR THIS REASON
1363-135842-0016 THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN AN ORDER OF THEIR OWN EXPLAINED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY BELONG TO THE ORDER OF MARSUPIALS WHICH MEANS POUCHED ANIMALS
1363-135842-0017 IT IS BECAUSE THE MOTHERS HAVE BIG POCKETS IN WHICH THEY CARRY THEIR BABIES OLD MISSUS POSSUM HAS JUST SUCH A POCKET
1363-135842-0018 THEY LOOK TOO FUNNY FOR ANYTHING THE OPOSSUMS ARE THE ONLY MARSUPIALS IN THIS COUNTRY CONTINUED OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0019 NOW HAVE I MADE IT QUITE CLEAR WHY ALTHOUGH THEY EAT FLESH UNC BILLY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM ARE NOT MEMBERS OF THE SAME BIG ORDER AS BUSTER BEAR AND THE OTHER FLESH EATERS EVERYBODY NODDED
1363-135842-0020 JUST THEN CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL SHOUTED HERE COMES UNC BILLY OL MISSUS POSSUM AND ALL THE LITTLE POSSUMS SURE ENOUGH DOWN THE LONE LITTLE PATH
1363-135842-0021 CAME THE POSSUM FAMILY AND A FUNNY LOOKING SIGHT THEY WERE UNC BILLY WAS WHITISH GRAY HIS FACE WHITER THAN THE REST OF HIM HE LOOKED AS IF HE HAD JUST GOTTEN OUT OF BED
1363-135842-0022 AND FORGOTTEN TO BRUSH HIS HAIR IT POINTED EVERY WHICH WAY HIS LEGS WERE DARK HIS FEET BLACK AND HIS TOES WHITE HIS EARS WERE WITHOUT ANY HAIR AT ALL
1363-135842-0023 AND WERE BLACK FOR THE LOWER HALF THE REST BEING WHITE HE HAD A LONG WHITISH TAIL WITHOUT ANY HAIR ON IT ALTOGETHER WITH HIS SHARP FACE AND NAKED TAIL
1363-135842-0024 HE LOOKED A GREAT DEAL AS THOUGH HE MIGHT BE A GIANT RAT BUT IF UNC BILLY WAS A FUNNY LOOKING FELLOW OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS EVEN MORE FUNNY LOOKING
1363-135842-0025 SHE SEEMED TO HAVE HEADS AND TAILS ALL OVER HER YOU SEE SHE HAD BROUGHT ALONG HER FAMILY AND OL MISSUS POSSUM IS ONE OF THOSE WHO BELIEVE IN LARGE FAMILIES
1363-135842-0026 THERE WERE TWELVE YOUNGSTERS AND THEY WERE EXACTLY LIKE THEIR PARENTS ONLY SMALL THEY WERE CLINGING ALL OVER OL MISSUS POSSUM SOME WERE ON HER BACK SOME WERE CLINGING TO HER SIDES
1363-135842-0027 AND A COUPLE WERE IN THE BIG POCKET WHERE THEY HAD SPENT THEIR BABYHOOD WE ALL DONE THOUGHT WE'D COME TO SCHOOL EXPLAINED UNC BILLY WITH A GRIN
1363-135842-0028 I'M GLAD YOU DID REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE YOU SEE THE REST OF YOUR FRIENDS HERE ARE A LITTLE CURIOUS ABOUT THE POSSUM FAMILY MEANWHILE OL MISSUS POSSUM WAS CLIMBING A TREE
1363-135842-0029 AND WHEN SHE HAD REACHED A COMFORTABLE CROTCH THE LITTLE POSSUMS LEFT HER AND BEGAN TO PLAY ABOUT IN THE TREE IT WAS THEN THAT IT APPEARED WHAT HANDY THINGS THOSE NAKED LITTLE TAILS WERE
1363-135842-0030 WHEN THE LITTLE POSSUMS CRAWLED OUT WHERE THE BRANCHES WERE SMALL THEY SIMPLY WRAPPED THEIR TAILS AROUND THE TWIGS TO KEEP FROM FALLING MY EXCLAIMED PETER
1363-135842-0031 THOSE CERTAINLY ARE HANDY TAILS HANDIEST TAILS EVER WAS DECLARED UNC BILLY
1363-135842-0032 SUPPOSE YOU CLIMB A TREE UNC BILLY AND SHOW YOUR FRIENDS HERE HOW YOU MANAGE TO GET THE EGGS FROM A NEST THAT YOU CANNOT REACH BY CRAWLING ALONG THE BRANCH ON WHICH IT IS PLACED SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE
1363-135842-0033 UNC BILLY GRINNED AND GOOD NATUREDLY STARTED UP A TREE HE CREPT OUT ON A BRANCH THAT OVERHUNG ANOTHER BRANCH WAY OUT WHERE THE BRANCH WAS SMALL CREPT UNC BILLY
1363-135842-0034 THEN HE WRAPPED THE END OF HIS TAIL AROUND THE BRANCH AND SWUNG HIMSELF OFF KEEPING HOLD OF THE BRANCH ONLY WITH HIS TAIL AND ONE HIND FOOT THEN
1363-135842-0035 STRETCHING DOWN FULL LENGTH HE COULD JUST REACH THE BRANCH BELOW HIM YOU SEE HE EXPLAINED IF THERE WAS A NEST ON THIS BRANCH DOWN HERE AH COULD GET THOSE EGGS WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE
1363-135842-0036 AGAIN UNC BILLY GRINNED AND THEN PULLED HIMSELF BACK TO THE OTHER BRANCH OLD MOTHER NATURE SHOOK HER HEAD REPROVINGLY UNC BILLY SAID SHE
1363-135842-0037 YOU ARE A BAD OLD RASCAL TO STEAL EGGS WHAT'S MORE
1363-135842-0038 IT IS A WONDER THAT BETWEEN YOU AND CHATTERER THE RED SQUIRREL ANY OF THE BIRDS SUCCEED IN RAISING FAMILIES AROUND HERE HAVE YOU VISITED FARMER BROWN'S HEN HOUSE LATELY UNC BILLY SHOOK HIS HEAD
1363-135842-0039 NOT LATELY SAID HE AH DONE GOT A DREADFUL SCARE THE LAST TIME AH WAS UP THERE
1363-135842-0040 WHERE IS YOUR HOME ASKED JOHNNY CHUCK I KNOW SAID PETER RABBIT IT'S UP IN A BIG HOLLOW TREE UNC BILLY LOOKED DOWN AT PETER
1363-135842-0041 SAID HE ARE POSSUMS FOUND ANYWHERE EXCEPT AROUND HERE INQUIRED HAPPY JACK YES INDEED REPLIED OLD MOTHER NATURE THEY ARE FOUND ALL DOWN THROUGH THE SUNNY SOUTH
1363-135842-0042 AND IN THE WARMER PARTS OF THE MIDDLE WEST UNC BILLY AND HIS RELATIVES ARE NOT FOND OF COLD WEATHER THEY PREFER TO BE WHERE THEY CAN BE REASONABLY WARM ALL THE YEAR ROUND SOME FOLKS THINK UNC BILLY ISN'T SMART
1363-135842-0043 BUT THOSE FOLKS DON'T KNOW UNC BILLY HE LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO THAT HE CAN'T RUN AS FAST AS SOME OTHERS SO HE HAS LEARNED TO DEPEND ON HIS WITS IN TIME OF DANGER WHAT DO YOU THINK HE DOES I
1363-135842-0044 KNOW CRIED PETER I SAW HIM DO IT ONCE FARMER BROWN'S BOY SURPRISED UNC BILLY AND UNC BILLY JUST FELL RIGHT OVER DEAD POOH THAT'S A STORY PETER RABBIT
1363-135842-0045 HOW COULD UNC BILLY HAVE FALLEN OVER DEAD AND BE ALIVE UP IN THAT TREE THIS VERY MINUTE CRIED HAPPY JACK I DIDN'T MEAN HE WAS REALLY DEAD BUT THAT HE LOOKED AS IF HE WERE DEAD EXPLAINED PETER
1363-135842-0046 AND HE DID TOO HE WAS THE DEADEST LOOKING THING I EVER SAW I THOUGHT HE WAS DEAD MYSELF I WAS WATCHING FROM A BRAMBLE TANGLE WHERE I WAS HIDING AND I CERTAINLY THOUGHT
1363-135842-0047 THE LIFE HAD BEEN SCARED RIGHT OUT OF UNC BILLY I GUESS FARMER BROWN'S BOY THOUGHT SO TOO HE PICKED UNC BILLY UP BY THE TAIL AND LOOKED HIM ALL OVER AND SAID YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1363-135842-0048 I DIDN'T MEAN TO HURT YOU UNC BILLY DIDN'T SO MUCH AS WINK AN EYE FARMER BROWN'S BOY WENT OFF UP THE PATH CARRYING UNC BILLY BY THE TAIL BY AND BY HE LAID UNC BILLY DOWN
1363-135842-0049 ON AN OLD STUMP WHILE HE WENT TO LOOK AT A NEST OF BLACKY THE CROW WHEN HE CAME BACK UNC BILLY WASN'T THERE I NEVER DID SEE UNC BILLY HURRY AS HE DID THE MINUTE FARMER BROWN'S BOY'S BACK WAS TURNED
1363-135842-0050 HE CAME TO LIFE AS SUDDENLY AS HE HAD DROPPED DEAD VERY GOOD PETER SAID OLD MOTHER NATURE SOME OTHER SMART LITTLE PEOPLE TRY THAT TRICK SOMETIMES
1363-135842-0051 BUT NONE OF THEM CAN DO IT AS WELL AS UNC BILLY POSSUM PRETENDING TO BE DEAD IN ORDER TO REMAIN ALIVE IS THE CLEVEREST THING UNC BILLY DOES
1363-139304-0000 CHAPTER THREE THE AWAKENING BUT WARMING WAS WRONG IN THAT AN AWAKENING CAME WHAT A WONDERFULLY COMPLEX THING THIS SIMPLE SEEMING UNITY
1363-139304-0001 THE SELF WHO CAN TRACE ITS REINTEGRATION AS MORNING AFTER MORNING WE AWAKEN THE FLUX AND CONFLUENCE OF ITS COUNTLESS FACTORS INTERWEAVING REBUILDING THE DIM FIRST STIRRINGS OF THE SOUL
1363-139304-0002 THE GROWTH AND SYNTHESIS OF THE UNCONSCIOUS TO THE SUBCONSCIOUS THE SUBCONSCIOUS TO DAWNING CONSCIOUSNESS UNTIL AT LAST WE RECOGNISE OURSELVES AGAIN AND AS IT HAPPENS TO MOST OF US AFTER THE NIGHT'S SLEEP
1363-139304-0003 SO IT WAS WITH GRAHAM AT THE END OF HIS VAST SLUMBER A DIM CLOUD OF SENSATION TAKING SHAPE A CLOUDY DREARINESS AND HE FOUND HIMSELF VAGUELY SOMEWHERE RECUMBENT FAINT BUT ALIVE
1363-139304-0004 THE PILGRIMAGE TOWARDS A PERSONAL BEING SEEMED TO TRAVERSE VAST GULFS TO OCCUPY EPOCHS GIGANTIC DREAMS THAT WERE TERRIBLE REALITIES AT THE TIME
1363-139304-0005 LEFT VAGUE PERPLEXING MEMORIES STRANGE CREATURES STRANGE SCENERY AS IF FROM ANOTHER PLANET THERE WAS A DISTINCT IMPRESSION TOO OF A MOMENTOUS CONVERSATION OF A NAME
1363-139304-0006 HE COULD NOT TELL WHAT NAME THAT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY TO RECUR OF SOME QUEER LONG FORGOTTEN SENSATION OF VEIN AND MUSCLE OF A FEELING OF VAST HOPELESS EFFORT
1363-139304-0007 THE EFFORT OF A MAN NEAR DROWNING IN DARKNESS THEN CAME A PANORAMA OF DAZZLING UNSTABLE CONFLUENT SCENES GRAHAM BECAME AWARE THAT HIS EYES WERE OPEN
1363-139304-0008 AND REGARDING SOME UNFAMILIAR THING IT WAS SOMETHING WHITE THE EDGE OF SOMETHING A FRAME OF WOOD HE MOVED HIS HEAD SLIGHTLY FOLLOWING THE CONTOUR OF THIS SHAPE
1363-139304-0009 IT WENT UP BEYOND THE TOP OF HIS EYES HE TRIED TO THINK WHERE HE MIGHT BE DID IT MATTER SEEING HE WAS SO WRETCHED
1363-139304-0010 HE FELT THE FEATURELESS MISERY OF ONE WHO WAKES TOWARDS THE HOUR OF DAWN HE HAD AN UNCERTAIN SENSE OF WHISPERS AND FOOTSTEPS HASTILY RECEDING
1363-139304-0011 THE MOVEMENT OF HIS HEAD INVOLVED A PERCEPTION OF EXTREME PHYSICAL WEAKNESS HE SUPPOSED HE WAS IN BED IN THE HOTEL AT THE PLACE IN THE VALLEY BUT HE COULD NOT RECALL THAT WHITE EDGE HE MUST HAVE SLEPT
1363-139304-0012 HE REMEMBERED NOW THAT HE HAD WANTED TO SLEEP HE RECALLED THE CLIFF AND WATERFALL AGAIN AND THEN RECOLLECTED SOMETHING ABOUT TALKING TO A PASSER BY HOW LONG HAD HE SLEPT
1363-139304-0013 WHAT WAS THAT SOUND OF PATTERING FEET AND THAT RISE AND FALL LIKE THE MURMUR OF BREAKERS ON PEBBLES HE PUT OUT A LANGUID HAND TO REACH HIS WATCH FROM THE CHAIR WHEREON IT WAS HIS HABIT TO PLACE IT
1363-139304-0014 AND TOUCHED SOME SMOOTH HARD SURFACE LIKE GLASS THIS WAS SO UNEXPECTED THAT IT STARTLED HIM EXTREMELY QUITE SUDDENLY HE ROLLED OVER STARED FOR A MOMENT AND STRUGGLED INTO A SITTING POSITION
1363-139304-0015 THE EFFORT WAS UNEXPECTEDLY DIFFICULT AND IT LEFT HIM GIDDY AND WEAK AND AMAZED HE RUBBED HIS EYES THE RIDDLE OF HIS SURROUNDINGS WAS CONFUSING
1363-139304-0016 BUT HIS MIND WAS QUITE CLEAR EVIDENTLY HIS SLEEP HAD BENEFITED HIM HE WAS NOT IN A BED AT ALL AS HE UNDERSTOOD THE WORD BUT LYING NAKED ON A VERY SOFT AND YIELDING MATTRESS
1363-139304-0017 IN A TROUGH OF DARK GLASS THE MATTRESS WAS PARTLY TRANSPARENT A FACT HE OBSERVED WITH A SENSE OF INSECURITY AND BELOW IT WAS A MIRROR REFLECTING HIM GREYLY
1363-139304-0018 ABOUT HIS ARM AND HE SAW WITH A SHOCK THAT HIS SKIN WAS STRANGELY DRY AND YELLOW WAS BOUND A CURIOUS APPARATUS OF RUBBER BOUND SO CUNNINGLY
1363-139304-0019 THAT IT SEEMED TO PASS INTO HIS SKIN ABOVE AND BELOW AND THIS BED WAS PLACED IN A CASE OF GREENISH COLOURED GLASS AS IT SEEMED TO HIM A BAR IN THE WHITE FRAMEWORK OF WHICH HAD FIRST ARRESTED HIS ATTENTION
1363-139304-0020 IN THE CORNER OF THE CASE WAS A STAND OF GLITTERING AND DELICATELY MADE APPARATUS FOR THE MOST PART QUITE STRANGE APPLIANCES THOUGH A MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM THERMOMETER WAS RECOGNISABLE
1363-139304-0021 THE SLIGHTLY GREENISH TINT OF THE GLASS LIKE SUBSTANCE WHICH SURROUNDED HIM ON EVERY HAND OBSCURED WHAT LAY BEHIND BUT HE PERCEIVED IT WAS A VAST APARTMENT OF SPLENDID APPEARANCE
1363-139304-0022 AND WITH A VERY LARGE AND SIMPLE WHITE ARCHWAY FACING HIM CLOSE TO THE WALLS OF THE CAGE WERE ARTICLES OF FURNITURE A TABLE COVERED WITH A SILVERY CLOTH SILVERY LIKE THE SIDE OF A FISH
1363-139304-0023 A COUPLE OF GRACEFUL CHAIRS AND ON THE TABLE A NUMBER OF DISHES WITH SUBSTANCES PILED ON THEM A BOTTLE AND TWO GLASSES HE REALISED THAT HE WAS INTENSELY HUNGRY HE COULD SEE NO ONE
1363-139304-0024 AND AFTER A PERIOD OF HESITATION SCRAMBLED OFF THE TRANSLUCENT MATTRESS AND TRIED TO STAND ON THE CLEAN WHITE FLOOR OF HIS LITTLE APARTMENT HE HAD MISCALCULATED HIS STRENGTH HOWEVER
1363-139304-0025 AND STAGGERED AND PUT HIS HAND AGAINST THE GLASS LIKE PANE BEFORE HIM TO STEADY HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT IT RESISTED HIS HAND BENDING OUTWARD LIKE A DISTENDED BLADDER THEN IT BROKE WITH A SLIGHT REPORT
1363-139304-0026 AND VANISHED A PRICKED BUBBLE HE REELED OUT INTO THE GENERAL SPACE OF THE HALL GREATLY ASTONISHED HE CAUGHT AT THE TABLE TO SAVE HIMSELF KNOCKING ONE OF THE GLASSES TO THE FLOOR
1363-139304-0027 IT RANG BUT DID NOT BREAK AND SAT DOWN IN ONE OF THE ARMCHAIRS WHEN HE HAD A LITTLE RECOVERED HE FILLED THE REMAINING GLASS FROM THE BOTTLE AND DRANK A COLOURLESS LIQUID IT WAS BUT NOT WATER
1363-139304-0028 WITH A PLEASING FAINT AROMA AND TASTE AND A QUALITY OF IMMEDIATE SUPPORT AND STIMULUS HE PUT DOWN THE VESSEL AND LOOKED ABOUT HIM
1363-139304-0029 THE APARTMENT LOST NONE OF ITS SIZE AND MAGNIFICENCE NOW THAT THE GREENISH TRANSPARENCY THAT HAD INTERVENED WAS REMOVED THE ARCHWAY HE SAW LED TO A FLIGHT OF STEPS GOING DOWNWARD WITHOUT THE INTERMEDIATION OF A DOOR
1363-139304-0030 TO A SPACIOUS TRANSVERSE PASSAGE THIS PASSAGE RAN BETWEEN POLISHED PILLARS OF SOME WHITE VEINED SUBSTANCE OF DEEP ULTRAMARINE AND ALONG IT CAME THE SOUND OF HUMAN MOVEMENTS
1363-139304-0031 AND VOICES AND A DEEP UNDEVIATING DRONING NOTE HE SAT NOW FULLY AWAKE LISTENING ALERTLY FORGETTING THE VIANDS IN HIS ATTENTION
1363-139304-0032 THEN WITH A SHOCK HE REMEMBERED THAT HE WAS NAKED AND CASTING ABOUT HIM FOR COVERING SAW A LONG BLACK ROBE THROWN ON ONE OF THE CHAIRS BESIDE HIM THIS HE WRAPPED ABOUT HIM AND SAT DOWN AGAIN TREMBLING
1363-139304-0033 HIS MIND WAS STILL A SURGING PERPLEXITY CLEARLY HE HAD SLEPT AND HAD BEEN REMOVED IN HIS SLEEP BUT WHERE AND WHO WERE THOSE PEOPLE THE DISTANT CROWD BEYOND THE DEEP BLUE PILLARS
1363-139304-0034 BOSCASTLE HE POURED OUT AND PARTIALLY DRANK ANOTHER GLASS OF THE COLOURLESS FLUID WHAT WAS THIS PLACE THIS PLACE THAT TO HIS SENSES SEEMED SUBTLY QUIVERING LIKE A THING ALIVE
1363-139304-0035 HE LOOKED ABOUT HIM AT THE CLEAN AND BEAUTIFUL FORM OF THE APARTMENT UNSTAINED BY ORNAMENT AND SAW THAT THE ROOF WAS BROKEN IN ONE PLACE BY A CIRCULAR SHAFT FULL OF LIGHT
1363-139304-0036 AND AS HE LOOKED A STEADY SWEEPING SHADOW BLOTTED IT OUT AND PASSED AND CAME AGAIN AND PASSED BEAT BEAT THAT SWEEPING SHADOW HAD A NOTE OF ITS OWN IN THE SUBDUED TUMULT THAT FILLED THE AIR
1363-139304-0037 HE WOULD HAVE CALLED OUT BUT ONLY A LITTLE SOUND CAME INTO HIS THROAT THEN HE STOOD UP AND WITH THE UNCERTAIN STEPS OF A DRUNKARD MADE HIS WAY TOWARDS THE ARCHWAY HE STAGGERED DOWN THE STEPS
1363-139304-0038 TRIPPED ON THE CORNER OF THE BLACK CLOAK HE HAD WRAPPED ABOUT HIMSELF AND SAVED HIMSELF BY CATCHING AT ONE OF THE BLUE PILLARS THE PASSAGE RAN DOWN A COOL VISTA OF BLUE AND PURPLE
1363-139304-0039 AND ENDED REMOTELY IN A RAILED SPACE LIKE A BALCONY BRIGHTLY LIT AND PROJECTING INTO A SPACE OF HAZE A SPACE LIKE THE INTERIOR OF SOME GIGANTIC BUILDING BEYOND AND REMOTE
1363-139304-0040 WERE VAST AND VAGUE ARCHITECTURAL FORMS THE TUMULT OF VOICES ROSE NOW LOUD AND CLEAR AND ON THE BALCONY AND WITH THEIR BACKS TO HIM GESTICULATING AND APPARENTLY IN ANIMATED CONVERSATION
1363-139304-0041 WERE THREE FIGURES RICHLY DRESSED IN LOOSE AND EASY GARMENTS OF BRIGHT SOFT COLOURINGS THE NOISE OF A GREAT MULTITUDE OF PEOPLE POURED UP OVER THE BALCONY AND ONCE IT SEEMED
1363-139304-0042 THE TOP OF A BANNER PASSED AND ONCE SOME BRIGHTLY COLOURED OBJECT A PALE BLUE CAP OR GARMENT THROWN UP INTO THE AIR PERHAPS FLASHED ATHWART THE SPACE AND FELL THE SHOUTS SOUNDED LIKE ENGLISH
1363-139304-0043 THERE WAS A REITERATION OF WAKE HE HEARD SOME INDISTINCT SHRILL CRY AND ABRUPTLY THESE THREE MEN BEGAN LAUGHING HA HA HA LAUGHED ONE
1363-139304-0044 A RED HAIRED MAN IN A SHORT PURPLE ROBE WHEN THE SLEEPER WAKES WHEN HE TURNED HIS EYES FULL OF MERRIMENT ALONG THE PASSAGE HIS FACE CHANGED THE WHOLE MAN CHANGED
1363-139304-0045 BECAME RIGID THE OTHER TWO TURNED SWIFTLY AT HIS EXCLAMATION AND STOOD MOTIONLESS THEIR FACES ASSUMED AN EXPRESSION OF CONSTERNATION AN EXPRESSION THAT DEEPENED INTO AWE

1447-17506-0000 CHAPTER NINE COUNT FERRALTI
1447-17506-0001 AT DINNER IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT THE FAMOUS TARANTELLA WOULD BE DANCED IN THE LOWER HALL OF THE HOTEL AT NINE O'CLOCK AND THE GIRLS TOLD UNCLE JOHN THAT THEY MUST NOT MISS THIS FAMOUS SIGHT WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST UNIQUE IN SORRENTO OR INDEED IN ALL ITALY
1447-17506-0002 AS THEY ENTERED THE PRETTY CIRCULAR HALL DEVOTED TO THE DANCE LOUISE GAVE A START OF SURPRISE
1447-17506-0003 A GOODLY AUDIENCE HAD ALREADY ASSEMBLED IN THE ROOM AND AMONG THEM THE GIRL SEEMED TO RECOGNIZE AN ACQUAINTANCE FOR AFTER A BRIEF HESITATION SHE ADVANCED AND PLACED HER HAND IN THAT OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD RISEN ON HER ENTRANCE AND HASTENED TOWARD HER
1447-17506-0004 HE WAS A NICE LOOKING YOUNG FELLOW BETH THOUGHT AND HAD A FOREIGN AND QUITE DISTINGUISHED AIR PRESENTLY LOUISE TURNED WITH CHEEKS SOMEWHAT FLUSHED AND BROUGHT THE GENTLEMAN TO HER PARTY
1447-17506-0005 INTRODUCING HIM TO UNCLE JOHN AND HER COUSINS AS COUNT FERRALTI WHOM SHE HAD ONCE MET IN NEW YORK WHILE HE WAS ON A VISIT TO AMERICA
1447-17506-0006 THE COUNT TWIRLED HIS SMALL AND SLENDER MOUSTACHES IN A WAY THAT PATSY THOUGHT AFFECTED AND SAID IN EXCELLENT ENGLISH
1447-17506-0007 NEW YORK ADOPTS A GOOD MANY SAID UNCLE JOHN DRILY IT HAS EVEN BEEN THOUGHTLESS ENOUGH TO ADOPT ME THE DANCERS ENTERED AT THAT MOMENT AND THE AMERICANS WERE FORCED TO SEAT THEMSELVES HASTILY SO AS NOT TO OBSTRUCT THE VIEW OF OTHERS
1447-17506-0008 COUNT FERRALTI FOUND A PLACE BESIDE LOUISE BUT SEEMED TO HAVE LITTLE TO SAY TO HER DURING THE COURSE OF THE ENTERTAINMENT THE DANCES WERE UNIQUE AND GRACEFUL BEING EXECUTED BY A TROUP OF LAUGHING PEASANTS DRESSED IN NATIVE COSTUME
1447-17506-0009 WHO SEEMED VERY PROUD OF THEIR ACCOMPLISHMENT AND ANXIOUS TO PLEASE THE THRONG OF TOURISTS PRESENT THE TARANTELLA ORIGINATED IN ISCHIA BUT SORRENTO AND CAPRI HAVE THE BEST DANCERS
1447-17506-0010 AFTERWARD UNCLE JOHN AND HIS NIECES STOOD UPON THE TERRACE AND WATCHED THE VOLCANO ROLLING ITS DENSE CLOUDS MINGLED WITH SPARKS OF RED HOT SCORIA TOWARD THE SKY
1447-17506-0011 THE COUNT CLUNG TO LOUISE'S SIDE BUT ALSO TRIED TO MAKE HIMSELF AGREEABLE TO HER COUSINS
1447-17506-0012 AND BETH REPLIED THAT HIS MANNERS WERE SO LIKE THOSE OF THEIR COUSIN LOUISE THAT THE TWO OUGHT TO GET ALONG NICELY TOGETHER UNCLE JOHN LIKED HIS NIECES TO MAKE FRIENDS AND ENCOURAGED YOUNG MEN GENERALLY TO MEET THEM
1447-17506-0013 BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE APPEARANCE OF THIS CALLOW ITALIAN NOBLEMAN THAT STAMPED HIS CHARACTER AS ARTIFICIAL AND INSINCERE HE RESOLVED TO FIND OUT SOMETHING ABOUT HIS ANTECEDENTS BEFORE HE PERMITTED THE YOUNG FELLOW
1447-17506-0014 TO ESTABLISH FRIENDLY RELATIONS WITH HIS GIRLS NEXT MORNING AFTER BREAKFAST HE WANDERED THROUGH THE LOBBY AND PAUSED AT THE LITTLE OFFICE WHERE HE DISCOVERED THAT THE PROPRIETOR OF THIS HOTEL WAS A BROTHER OF THAT FLORIANO WHO MANAGED THE HOTEL DU VESUVE
1447-17506-0015 THAT GAVE HIM AN EXCUSE TO TALK WITH THE MAN WHO SPOKE VERY GOOD ENGLISH AND WAS EXCEEDINGLY COURTEOUS TO HIS GUESTS ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY WERE AMERICAN
1447-17506-0016 COUNT FERRALTI THE YOUNG MAN STANDING BY THE WINDOW YONDER I I DID NOT KNOW HE SAID HESITATINGLY THE GENTLEMAN ARRIVED LAST EVENING AND I HAD NOT YET LEARNED HIS NAME LET ME SEE
1447-17506-0017 HE TURNED TO HIS LIST OF GUESTS WHO REGISTER BY CARD AND NOT IN A BOOK AND CONTINUED
1447-17506-0018 HE HAS GIVEN HIS NAME AS FERRALTI BUT ADDED NO TITLE A COUNT DID YOU SAY YES REPLIED UNCLE JOHN THE PROPRIETOR LOOKED CURIOUSLY TOWARD THE YOUNG MAN WHOSE BACK ONLY WAS VISIBLE
1447-17506-0019 THEN HE REMARKED THAT THE ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS WAS WANING AND THE TROUBLE NEARLY OVER FOR THIS TIME
1447-17506-0020 THAT I CANNOT TELL YOU SIGNOR MERRICK OH PERHAPS YOU KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE NOBILITY OF YOUR COUNTRY I I KNOW LITTLE OF THE NOBILITY ANSWERED FLORIANO INDIGNANTLY
1447-17506-0021 MY DEAR SIGNOR THERE IS NO MAN BETTER POSTED AS TO OUR NOBILITY IN ALL ITALY YET YOU SAY YOU DON'T KNOW THE FERRALTI FAMILY
1447-17506-0022 OBSERVE SIGNOR HERE IS OUR RECORD OF NOBILITY IT IS THE SAME AS THE BLUE BOOK OR THE PEERAGE OF ENGLAND EITHER FORTUNATELY OR UNFORTUNATELY I CANNOT SAY YOU HAVE NO NEED OF SUCH A BOOK IN AMERICA
1447-17506-0023 HE TURNED THE PAGES AND RAN HIS FINGER DOWN THE LINE OF FS FIND ME IF YOU CAN A COUNT FERRALTI IN THE LIST UNCLE JOHN LOOKED HE PUT ON HIS GLASSES AND LOOKED AGAIN
1447-17506-0024 AND NO SUCH NOBLE FAMILY SIGNOR MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WHISTLED SOFTLY AND WALKED AWAY TO THE WINDOW THE YOUNG MAN GREETED HIM WITH A SMILE AND A BOW I MISUNDERSTOOD YOUR NAME LAST EVENING HE SAID I THOUGHT YOU WERE COUNT FERRALTI
1447-17506-0025 AND THAT IS RIGHT SIR WAS THE PROMPT REPLY ALLOW ME TO OFFER YOU MY CARD UNCLE JOHN TOOK THE CARD AND READ CONTE LEONARDI FERRALTI MILANO ITALIA
1447-17506-0026 HE CAREFULLY PLACED THE CARD IN HIS POCKET BOOK THANK YOU SAID HE IT'S A FINE MORNING COUNT CHARMING MISTER MERRICK UNCLE JOHN WALKED AWAY HE WAS GLAD THAT HE HAD NOT SUSPECTED THE YOUNG MAN UNJUSTLY
1447-17506-0027 WHEN AN IMPOSTURE IS UNMASKED IT IS NO LONGER DANGEROUS HE JOINED HIS NIECES WHO WERE ALL BUSILY ENGAGED IN WRITING LETTERS HOME AND REMARKED CASUALLY YOU'VE BEEN DECEIVED IN YOUR ITALIAN FRIEND LOUISE
1447-17506-0028 HE IS NEITHER A COUNT NOR OF NOBLE FAMILY ALTHOUGH I SUPPOSE WHEN YOU MET HIM IN NEW YORK HE HAD AN OBJECT IN POSING AS A TITLED ARISTOCRAT THE GIRL PAUSED EXAMINING THE POINT OF HER PEN THOUGHTFULLY
1447-17506-0029 HAS NEVER BEFORE HEARD OF HIM HOW SINGULAR EXCLAIMED LOUISE I WONDER WHY HE HAS TRIED TO DECEIVE US OH THE WORLD IS FULL OF IMPOSTORS BUT WHEN YOU ARE ON TO THEIR GAME THEY ARE QUITE HARMLESS
1447-17506-0030 UNCLE JOHN HARDLY KNEW WHAT TO SAY FURTHER HE FELT HE WAS IN AN AWKWARD POSITION FOR LOUISE WAS THE MOST EXPERIENCED IN WORLDLY WAYS OF HIS THREE NIECES AND HE HAD NO DESIRE TO POSE AS A STERN GUARDIAN
1447-17506-0031 OR TO DEPRIVE HIS GIRLS OF ANY PASSING PLEASURE THEY MIGHT ENJOY MOREOVER LOUISE BEING IN LOVE WITH THAT YOUNG WELDON HER MOTHER SO STRONGLY OBJECTED TO
1447-17506-0032 SHE WOULD NOT BE LIKELY TO CARE MUCH FOR THIS ITALIAN FELLOW AND MISSUS MERRICK HAD ENJOINED HIM TO KEEP HER DAUGHTER'S MIND FROM DWELLING ON HER ENTANGLEMENT OH WELL MY DEAR HE SAID TO HER YOU MUST ACT AS YOU SEE FIT
1447-17506-0033 I DO NOT IMAGINE WE SHALL SEE MUCH OF THIS YOUNG MAN IN ANY EVENT AND NOW THAT YOU ARE WELL AWARE OF THE FACT THAT HE IS SAILING UNDER FALSE COLORS YOU WILL KNOW HOW TO HANDLE HIM BETTER THAN I CAN ADVISE YOU
1447-17506-0034 SAID LOUISE SLOWLY AS SHE RESUMED HER WRITING WELL THEN GIRLS WHAT DO YOU SAY TO A STROLL AROUND THE VILLAGE ASKED THEIR UNCLE I'M TOLD IT'S A PROPER PLACE TO BUY SILK STOCKINGS AND INLAID WOOD WORK THEY COME ASSORTED I SUPPOSE
1455-134435-0000 THE GIRL WHO CAME INTO THE WORLD ON THAT NIGHT WHEN JESSE RAN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING TO GOD THAT HE BE GIVEN A SON HAD GROWN TO WOMANHOOD ON THE FARM
1455-134435-0001 AND WHEN NOT ANGRY SHE WAS OFTEN MOROSE AND SILENT IN WINESBURG IT WAS SAID THAT SHE DRANK HER HUSBAND THE BANKER
1455-134435-0002 BUT LOUISE COULD NOT BE MADE HAPPY SHE FLEW INTO HALF INSANE FITS OF TEMPER DURING WHICH SHE WAS SOMETIMES SILENT SOMETIMES NOISY AND QUARRELSOME SHE SWORE AND CRIED OUT IN HER ANGER SHE GOT A KNIFE FROM THE KITCHEN AND THREATENED HER HUSBAND'S LIFE
1455-134435-0003 SOMETIMES ON SUMMER AFTERNOONS SHE CAME OUT OF THE HOUSE AND GOT INTO HER CARRIAGE DISMISSING THE DRIVER SHE TOOK THE REINS IN HER OWN HANDS AND DROVE OFF AT TOP SPEED THROUGH THE STREETS
1455-134435-0004 TO THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SHE WANTED TO RUN THEM DOWN WHEN SHE HAD DRIVEN THROUGH SEVERAL STREETS TEARING AROUND CORNERS AND BEATING THE HORSES WITH THE WHIP SHE DROVE OFF INTO THE COUNTRY ON THE COUNTRY ROADS
1455-134435-0005 SHE BECAME THOUGHTFUL AND MUTTERED WORDS SOMETIMES TEARS CAME INTO HER EYES
1455-134435-0006 BUT FOR THE INFLUENCE OF HER HUSBAND AND THE RESPECT HE INSPIRED IN PEOPLE'S MINDS
1455-134435-0007 HE WAS TOO YOUNG THEN TO HAVE OPINIONS OF HIS OWN ABOUT PEOPLE BUT AT TIMES IT WAS DIFFICULT FOR HIM NOT TO HAVE VERY DEFINITE OPINIONS ABOUT THE WOMAN WHO WAS HIS MOTHER DAVID WAS ALWAYS A QUIET ORDERLY BOY
1455-134435-0008 AND FOR A LONG TIME WAS THOUGHT BY THE PEOPLE OF WINESBURG TO BE SOMETHING OF A DULLARD HIS EYES WERE BROWN AND AS A CHILD HE HAD A HABIT OF LOOKING AT THINGS AND PEOPLE A LONG TIME WITHOUT APPEARING TO SEE WHAT HE WAS LOOKING AT
1455-134435-0009 WHEN HE HEARD HIS MOTHER SPOKEN OF HARSHLY OR WHEN HE OVERHEARD HER BERATING HIS FATHER HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND RAN AWAY TO HIDE SOMETIMES HE COULD NOT FIND A HIDING PLACE AND THAT CONFUSED HIM
1455-134435-0010 HE CLOSED HIS EYES AND TRIED NOT TO THINK OF ANYTHING HE HAD A HABIT OF TALKING ALOUD TO HIMSELF AND EARLY IN LIFE A SPIRIT OF QUIET SADNESS OFTEN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM ON THE OCCASIONS WHEN DAVID WENT TO VISIT HIS GRANDFATHER ON THE BENTLEY FARM
1455-134435-0011 SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DAVID HE COULD NOT BEAR TO GO INTO THE HOUSE WHERE HIS MOTHER AND FATHER LIVED AND ON AN IMPULSE HE DECIDED TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME
1455-134435-0012 THE BOY'S IMAGINATION WAS EXCITED AND HE FANCIED THAT HE COULD SEE AND HEAR STRANGE THINGS IN THE DARKNESS INTO HIS MIND CAME THE CONVICTION THAT HE WAS WALKING AND RUNNING IN SOME TERRIBLE VOID WHERE NO ONE HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
1455-134435-0013 THE DARKNESS ABOUT HIM SEEMED LIMITLESS THE SOUND OF THE WIND BLOWING IN TREES WAS TERRIFYING WHEN A TEAM OF HORSES APPROACHED ALONG THE ROAD IN WHICH HE WALKED HE WAS FRIGHTENED AND CLIMBED A FENCE THROUGH A FIELD HE RAN UNTIL HE CAME
1455-134435-0014 INTO ANOTHER ROAD AND GETTING UPON HIS KNEES FELT OF THE SOFT GROUND WITH HIS FINGERS BUT FOR THE FIGURE OF HIS GRANDFATHER WHOM HE WAS AFRAID HE WOULD NEVER FIND IN THE DARKNESS HE THOUGHT THE WORLD MUST BE ALTOGETHER EMPTY
1455-134435-0015 WHEN HIS CRIES WERE HEARD BY A FARMER WHO WAS WALKING HOME FROM TOWN AND HE WAS BROUGHT BACK TO HIS FATHER'S HOUSE HE WAS SO TIRED AND EXCITED THAT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO HIM BY CHANCE DAVID'S FATHER KNEW THAT HE HAD DISAPPEARED
1455-134435-0016 ON THE STREET HE HAD MET THE FARM HAND FROM THE BENTLEY PLACE AND KNEW OF HIS SON'S RETURN TO TOWN WHEN THE BOY DID NOT COME HOME AN ALARM WAS SET UP AND JOHN HARDY WITH SEVERAL MEN OF THE TOWN WENT TO SEARCH THE COUNTRY
1455-134435-0017 THE REPORT THAT DAVID HAD BEEN KIDNAPPED RAN ABOUT THROUGH THE STREETS OF WINESBURG WHEN HE CAME HOME THERE WERE NO LIGHTS IN THE HOUSE BUT HIS MOTHER APPEARED AND CLUTCHED HIM EAGERLY IN HER ARMS DAVID THOUGHT SHE HAD SUDDENLY BECOME ANOTHER WOMAN
1455-134435-0018 FOR AN HOUR THE WOMAN SAT IN THE DARKNESS AND HELD HER BOY ALL THE TIME SHE KEPT TALKING IN A LOW VOICE DAVID COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT HAD SO CHANGED HER HER HABITUALLY DISSATISFIED FACE HAD BECOME HE THOUGHT
1455-134435-0019 THE MOST PEACEFUL AND LOVELY THING HE HAD EVER SEEN
1455-134435-0020 ON AND ON WENT HER VOICE IT WAS NOT
1455-134435-0021 BUT SHE MADE HIM HIDE AND BE SILENT UNTIL SHE HAD SENT THEM AWAY HE THOUGHT IT MUST BE A GAME HIS MOTHER AND THE MEN OF THE TOWN WERE PLAYING WITH HIM AND LAUGHED JOYOUSLY
1455-134435-0022 INTO HIS MIND CAME THE THOUGHT THAT HIS HAVING BEEN LOST AND FRIGHTENED IN THE DARKNESS WAS AN ALTOGETHER UNIMPORTANT MATTER
1455-134435-0023 HE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD HAVE BEEN WILLING TO GO THROUGH THE FRIGHTFUL EXPERIENCE A THOUSAND TIMES TO BE SURE OF FINDING AT THE END OF THE LONG BLACK ROAD A THING SO LOVELY AS HIS MOTHER HAD SUDDENLY BECOME
1455-134435-0024 DURING THE LAST YEARS OF YOUNG DAVID'S BOYHOOD HE SAW HIS MOTHER BUT SELDOM AND SHE BECAME FOR HIM JUST A WOMAN WITH WHOM HE HAD ONCE LIVED STILL HE COULD NOT GET HER FIGURE OUT OF HIS MIND AND AS HE GREW OLDER IT BECAME MORE DEFINITE
1455-134435-0025 WHEN HE WAS TWELVE YEARS OLD HE WENT TO THE BENTLEY FARM TO LIVE OLD JESSE CAME INTO TOWN AND FAIRLY DEMANDED THAT HE BE GIVEN CHARGE OF THE BOY THE OLD MAN WAS EXCITED AND DETERMINED ON HAVING HIS OWN WAY HE TALKED TO JOHN HARDY
1455-134435-0026 IT IS AN ATMOSPHERE NOT CORRUPTED BY MY PRESENCE SHE SAID SHARPLY
1455-134435-0027 DIFFERENT WITH HIM LOUISE TURNED AND WENT OUT OF THE ROOM LEAVING THE TWO MEN TO SIT IN EMBARRASSED SILENCE AS VERY OFTEN HAPPENED SHE LATER STAYED IN HER ROOM FOR DAYS
1455-134435-0028 EVEN WHEN THE BOY'S CLOTHES WERE PACKED AND HE WAS TAKEN AWAY SHE DID NOT APPEAR THE LOSS OF HER SON MADE A SHARP BREAK IN HER LIFE AND SHE SEEMED LESS INCLINED TO QUARREL WITH HER HUSBAND JOHN HARDY THOUGHT IT HAD ALL TURNED OUT VERY WELL INDEED
1455-134435-0029 AND SO YOUNG DAVID WENT TO LIVE IN THE BENTLEY FARMHOUSE WITH JESSE TWO OF THE OLD FARMER'S SISTERS WERE ALIVE AND STILL LIVED IN THE HOUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF JESSE AND RARELY SPOKE WHEN HE WAS ABOUT
1455-134435-0030 ONE OF THE WOMEN WHO HAD BEEN NOTED FOR HER FLAMING RED HAIR WHEN SHE WAS YOUNGER WAS A BORN MOTHER AND BECAME THE BOY'S CARETAKER EVERY NIGHT WHEN HE HAD GONE TO BED SHE WENT INTO HIS ROOM AND SAT ON THE FLOOR
1455-134435-0031 WHEN HE BECAME DROWSY SHE BECAME BOLD AND WHISPERED THINGS THAT HE LATER THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE DREAMED HER SOFT LOW VOICE CALLED HIM ENDEARING NAMES
1455-134435-0032 AND HE DREAMED THAT HIS MOTHER HAD COME TO HIM AND THAT SHE HAD CHANGED SO THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS AS SHE HAD BEEN THAT TIME AFTER HE RAN AWAY HE ALSO GREW BOLD AND REACHING OUT HIS HAND STROKED THE FACE OF THE WOMAN ON THE FLOOR SO THAT SHE WAS ECSTATICALLY HAPPY
1455-134435-0033 BEGAN TO THINK THAT AT LAST HIS PRAYERS HAD BEEN ANSWERED ALTHOUGH HE WAS AT THAT TIME ONLY FIFTY FIVE YEARS OLD HE LOOKED SEVENTY AND WAS WORN OUT WITH MUCH THINKING AND SCHEMING
1455-134435-0034 THE EFFORT HE HAD MADE TO EXTEND HIS LAND HOLDINGS HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL AND THERE WERE FEW FARMS IN THE VALLEY THAT DID NOT BELONG TO HIM BUT UNTIL DAVID CAME HE WAS A BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED MAN
1455-134435-0035 THERE WERE TWO INFLUENCES AT WORK IN JESSE BENTLEY AND ALL HIS LIFE HIS MIND HAD BEEN A BATTLEGROUND FOR THESE INFLUENCES FIRST THERE WAS THE OLD THING IN HIM HE WANTED TO BE A MAN OF GOD AND A LEADER AMONG MEN OF GOD
1455-134435-0036 HIS WALKING IN THE FIELDS AND THROUGH THE FORESTS AT NIGHT HAD BROUGHT HIM CLOSE TO NATURE AND THERE WERE FORCES IN THE PASSIONATELY RELIGIOUS MAN THAT RAN OUT TO THE FORCES IN NATURE THE DISAPPOINTMENT THAT HAD COME TO HIM WHEN A DAUGHTER
1455-134435-0037 BUT HE NO LONGER DEMANDED SUCH RECOGNITION INSTEAD HE PRAYED FOR IT SOMETIMES HE WAS ALTOGETHER DOUBTFUL AND THOUGHT GOD HAD DESERTED THE WORLD
1455-134435-0038 HE HAD GROWN INTO MATURITY IN AMERICA IN THE YEARS AFTER THE CIVIL WAR AND HE LIKE ALL MEN OF HIS TIME HAD BEEN TOUCHED BY THE DEEP INFLUENCES THAT WERE AT WORK IN THE COUNTRY DURING THOSE YEARS WHEN MODERN INDUSTRIALISM WAS BEING BORN
1455-134435-0039 JESSE FORMED THE HABIT OF READING NEWSPAPERS AND MAGAZINES HE INVENTED A MACHINE FOR THE MAKING OF FENCE OUT OF WIRE FAINTLY HE REALIZED THAT THE ATMOSPHERE OF OLD TIMES AND PLACES THAT HE HAD
1455-134435-0040 ALWAYS CULTIVATED IN HIS OWN MIND WAS STRANGE AND FOREIGN TO THE THING THAT WAS GROWING UP IN THE MINDS OF OTHERS THE BEGINNING OF THE MOST MATERIALISTIC AGE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WHEN WARS WOULD BE FOUGHT WITHOUT PATRIOTISM WHEN MEN WOULD FORGET GOD AND
1455-134435-0041 ONLY PAY ATTENTION TO MORAL STANDARDS WHEN THE WILL TO POWER WOULD REPLACE THE WILL TO SERVE AND BEAUTY WOULD BE WELL NIGH FORGOTTEN IN THE TERRIBLE HEADLONG RUSH OF MANKIND TOWARD THE ACQUIRING OF POSSESSIONS WAS TELLING ITS STORY TO JESSE THE MAN OF GOD
1455-134435-0042 AS IT WAS TO THE MEN ABOUT HIM THE GREEDY THING IN HIM WANTED TO MAKE MONEY FASTER THAN IT COULD BE MADE BY TILLING THE LAND MORE THAN ONCE HE WENT INTO WINESBURG TO TALK WITH HIS SON IN LAW JOHN HARDY ABOUT IT YOU ARE A BANKER AND YOU WILL HAVE CHANCES I NEVER HAD
1455-134435-0043 BIG THINGS ARE GOING TO BE DONE IN THE COUNTRY
1455-134435-0044 YOU GET INTO IT I WISH I WERE YOUNGER AND HAD YOUR CHANCE
1455-134435-0045 AT ONE TIME IN HIS LIFE HE HAD BEEN THREATENED WITH PARALYSIS AND HIS LEFT SIDE REMAINED SOMEWHAT WEAKENED AS HE TALKED HIS LEFT EYELID TWITCHED LATER
1455-134435-0046 AND THE STARS CAME OUT IT WAS HARDER TO GET BACK THE OLD FEELING OF A CLOSE AND PERSONAL GOD WHO LIVED IN THE SKY OVERHEAD AND WHO MIGHT AT ANY MOMENT REACH OUT HIS HAND TOUCH HIM ON THE SHOULDER
1455-134435-0047 AND IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT GOD HAD AT LAST LOOKED WITH FAVOR UPON HIM AS FOR THE BOY ON THE FARM LIFE BEGAN TO REVEAL ITSELF TO HIM IN A THOUSAND NEW AND DELIGHTFUL WAYS THE KINDLY ATTITUDE OF ALL ABOUT HIM EXPANDED HIS QUIET NATURE
1455-134435-0048 AND HE LOST THE HALF TIMID HESITATING MANNER HE HAD ALWAYS HAD WITH HIS PEOPLE AT NIGHT WHEN HE WENT TO BED AFTER A LONG DAY OF ADVENTURES IN THE STABLES IN THE FIELDS OR DRIVING ABOUT FROM FARM TO FARM WITH HIS GRANDFATHER HE WANTED TO EMBRACE EVERYONE IN THE HOUSE
1455-134435-0049 IF SHERLEY BENTLEY THE WOMAN WHO CAME EACH NIGHT TO SIT ON THE FLOOR BY HIS BEDSIDE DID NOT APPEAR AT ONCE HE WENT TO THE HEAD OF THE STAIRS AND SHOUTED HIS YOUNG VOICE RINGING THROUGH THE NARROW HALLS WHERE FOR SO LONG THERE HAD BEEN A TRADITION OF SILENCE IN THE MORNING WHEN HE AWOKE AND LAY STILL IN BED
1455-134435-0050 THE SOUNDS THAT CAME IN TO HIM THROUGH THE WINDOWS FILLED HIM WITH DELIGHT HE THOUGHT WITH A SHUDDER OF THE LIFE IN THE HOUSE IN WINESBURG AND OF HIS MOTHER'S ANGRY VOICE THAT HAD ALWAYS MADE HIM TREMBLE THERE IN THE COUNTRY ALL SOUNDS WERE PLEASANT SOUNDS
1455-134435-0051 WHEN HE AWOKE AT DAWN THE BARNYARD BACK OF THE HOUSE ALSO AWOKE IN THE HOUSE PEOPLE STIRRED ABOUT ELIZA STOUGHTON THE HALF WITTED GIRL WAS POKED IN THE RIBS BY A FARM HAND AND GIGGLED NOISILY IN SOME DISTANT FIELD A COW BAWLED AND WAS ANSWERED
1455-134435-0052 BY THE CATTLE IN THE STABLES AND ONE OF THE FARM HANDS SPOKE SHARPLY TO THE HORSE HE WAS GROOMING BY THE STABLE DOOR DAVID LEAPED OUT OF BED AND RAN TO A WINDOW ALL OF THE PEOPLE STIRRING ABOUT EXCITED HIS MIND AND HE WONDERED WHAT HIS MOTHER WAS DOING
1455-134435-0053 SIX SEVEN HE SAID SLOWLY WETTING HIS FINGER AND MAKING STRAIGHT UP AND DOWN MARKS ON THE WINDOW LEDGE DAVID RAN TO PUT ON HIS TROUSERS AND SHIRT A FEVERISH DESIRE TO GET OUT OF DOORS TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-134435-0054 WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE LONG OLD HOUSE SHUTTING THE DOORS BEHIND HIM WITH A BANG HE CAME INTO THE BARNYARD AND LOOKED ABOUT WITH AN AMAZED AIR OF EXPECTANCY
1455-134435-0055 HENRY STRADER AN OLD MAN WHO HAD BEEN ON THE FARM SINCE JESSE CAME INTO POSSESSION AND WHO BEFORE DAVID'S TIME HAD NEVER BEEN KNOWN TO MAKE A JOKE MADE THE SAME JOKE EVERY MORNING IT AMUSED DAVID SO THAT HE LAUGHED AND CLAPPED HIS HANDS
1455-134435-0056 THEY RODE IN A COMFORTABLE OLD PHAETON DRAWN BY THE WHITE HORSE THE OLD MAN SCRATCHED HIS THIN WHITE BEARD AND TALKED TO HIMSELF OF HIS PLANS FOR INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVENESS OF THE FIELDS THEY VISITED AND OF GOD'S PART IN THE PLANS ALL MEN MADE
1455-134435-0057 SOMETIMES HE LOOKED AT DAVID AND SMILED HAPPILY AND THEN FOR A LONG TIME HE APPEARED TO FORGET THE BOY'S EXISTENCE
1455-134435-0058 WHEN HE HAD FIRST COME OUT OF THE CITY TO LIVE ON THE LAND
1455-134435-0059 JESSE AND HIS GRANDSON WERE DRIVING IN A DISTANT PART OF THE VALLEY SOME MILES FROM HOME A FOREST CAME DOWN TO THE ROAD AND THROUGH THE FOREST WINE CREEK WRIGGLED ITS WAY OVER STONES TOWARD A DISTANT RIVER
1455-134435-0060 ALL THE AFTERNOON JESSE HAD BEEN IN A MEDITATIVE MOOD AND NOW HE BEGAN TO TALK HIS MIND WENT BACK TO THE NIGHT WHEN HE HAD BEEN FRIGHTENED BY THOUGHTS OF A GIANT THAT MIGHT COME TO ROB AND PLUNDER HIM OF HIS POSSESSIONS
1455-134435-0061 AND AGAIN AS ON THAT NIGHT WHEN HE HAD RUN THROUGH THE FIELDS CRYING FOR A SON HE BECAME EXCITED TO THE EDGE OF INSANITY
1455-134435-0062 WHEN A RABBIT JUMPED UP AND RAN AWAY THROUGH THE WOODS HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND DANCED WITH DELIGHT
1455-134435-0063 JESSE BENTLEY WENT ALONG UNDER THE TREES WITH HIS HEAD BOWED AND WITH HIS MIND IN A FERMENT HIS EARNESTNESS AFFECTED THE BOY WHO PRESENTLY BECAME SILENT AND A LITTLE ALARMED
1455-134435-0064 THAT THE PRESENCE OF THE BOY AND MAN ON THEIR KNEES IN SOME LONELY SPOT IN THE FOREST WOULD MAKE THE MIRACLE HE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR ALMOST INEVITABLE
1455-134435-0065 IT WAS IN JUST SUCH A PLACE AS THIS THAT OTHER DAVID TENDED THE SHEEP WHEN HIS FATHER CAME AND TOLD HIM TO GO DOWN UNTO SAUL HE MUTTERED
1455-134435-0066 HE CLIMBED OVER A FALLEN LOG AND WHEN HE HAD COME TO AN OPEN PLACE AMONG THE TREES HE DROPPED UPON HIS KNEES AND BEGAN TO PRAY IN A LOUD VOICE A KIND OF TERROR HE HAD NEVER KNOWN BEFORE TOOK POSSESSION OF DAVID
1455-134435-0067 IT SEEMED TO HIM THAT HE WAS IN THE PRESENCE NOT ONLY OF HIS GRANDFATHER BUT OF SOMEONE ELSE SOMEONE WHO MIGHT HURT HIM SOMEONE WHO WAS NOT KINDLY BUT DANGEROUS AND BRUTAL
1455-134435-0068 WHEN JESSE BENTLEY ABSORBED IN HIS OWN IDEA SUDDENLY AROSE AND ADVANCED TOWARD HIM HIS TERROR GREW UNTIL HIS WHOLE BODY SHOOK IN THE WOODS AN INTENSE SILENCE SEEMED TO LIE OVER EVERYTHING AND SUDDENLY OUT OF THE SILENCE CAME THE OLD MAN'S HARSH AND INSISTENT VOICE
1455-134435-0069 GRIPPING THE BOY'S SHOULDERS JESSE TURNED HIS FACE TO THE SKY AND SHOUTED THE WHOLE LEFT SIDE OF HIS FACE TWITCHED AND HIS HAND ON THE BOY'S SHOULDER TWITCHED ALSO MAKE A SIGN TO ME GOD HE CRIED HERE I STAND WITH THE BOY DAVID
1455-134435-0070 COME DOWN TO ME OUT OF THE SKY AND MAKE THY PRESENCE KNOWN TO ME WITH A CRY OF FEAR DAVID TURNED AND SHAKING HIMSELF LOOSE FROM THE HANDS THAT HELD HIM RAN AWAY THROUGH THE FOREST
1455-134435-0071 THE MAN DID NOT LOOK LIKE HIS GRANDFATHER THE CONVICTION THAT SOMETHING STRANGE AND TERRIBLE HAD HAPPENED THAT BY SOME MIRACLE A NEW AND DANGEROUS PERSON HAD COME INTO THE BODY OF THE KINDLY OLD MAN TOOK POSSESSION OF HIM
1455-134435-0072 ON AND ON HE RAN DOWN THE HILLSIDE SOBBING AS HE RAN WHEN HE FELL OVER THE ROOTS OF A TREE AND IN FALLING STRUCK HIS HEAD
1455-134435-0073 AND HE AWOKE TO FIND THE OLD MAN'S HAND STROKING HIS HEAD TENDERLY THAT THE TERROR LEFT HIM
1455-138263-0000 CHAPTER EIGHTEEN GRAVE QUESTIONS
1455-138263-0001 AND BARBICANE AND HIS TWO COMPANIONS WATCHED WITH SCRUPULOUS ATTENTION THE BRILLIANT RAYS WHICH THE CELEBRATED MOUNTAIN SHED SO CURIOUSLY OVER THE HORIZON WHAT WAS THIS RADIANT GLORY WHAT
1455-138263-0002 SOME TWELVE MILES OTHERS THIRTY MILES BROAD
1455-138263-0003 AND SEEMED TO COVER PARTICULARLY TOWARD THE EAST THE NORTHEAST AND THE NORTH THE HALF OF THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE ONE OF THESE JETS EXTENDED AS FAR AS THE CIRCLE OF NEANDER SITUATED ON THE FORTIETH MERIDIAN
1455-138263-0004 ANOTHER BY A SLIGHT CURVE FURROWED THE SEA OF NECTAR BREAKING AGAINST
1455-138263-0005 WITH A LUMINOUS NETWORK WHAT WAS THE ORIGIN OF THESE SPARKLING RAYS WHICH SHONE ON THE PLAINS AS WELL AS ON THE RELIEFS AT WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE ALL STARTED FROM A COMMON CENTER THE CRATER
1455-138263-0006 THEY SPRANG FROM HIM HERSCHEL ATTRIBUTED THEIR BRILLIANCY TO CURRENTS OF LAVA CONGEALED BY THE COLD AN OPINION HOWEVER WHICH HAS NOT BEEN GENERALLY ADOPTED
1455-138263-0007 BECAUSE THE REGULARITY OF THESE LUMINOUS LINES AND THE VIOLENCE NECESSARY TO CARRY VOLCANIC MATTER TO SUCH DISTANCES IS INEXPLICABLE
1455-138263-0008 BY JOVE REPLIED MICHEL ARDAN
1455-138263-0009 INDEED SAID BARBICANE INDEED CONTINUED MICHEL IT IS ENOUGH TO SAY
1455-138263-0010 WELL REPLIED BARBICANE SMILING AND WHAT HAND WOULD BE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO THROW A BALL TO GIVE SUCH A SHOCK AS THAT THE HAND IS NOT NECESSARY ANSWERED NICHOLL NOT AT ALL CONFOUNDED
1455-138263-0011 THE SHOCK WHICH PRODUCED THAT RENT
1455-138263-0012 A CONTRACTION SOMETHING LIKE A LUNAR STOMACH ACHE SAID MICHEL ARDAN BESIDES ADDED BARBICANE THIS OPINION IS THAT OF AN ENGLISH SAVANT
1455-138263-0013 THAT NASMYTH WAS NO FOOL REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0014 THEIR PROJECTILE SATURATED WITH LUMINOUS GLEAMS IN THE DOUBLE IRRADIATION OF SUN AND MOON MUST HAVE APPEARED LIKE AN INCANDESCENT GLOBE
1455-138263-0015 TO INTENSE HEAT NATURE WAS THUS PREPARING THEM TO BECOME SELENITES BECOME SELENITES THAT IDEA BROUGHT UP ONCE MORE THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON AFTER WHAT THEY HAD SEEN COULD THE TRAVELERS SOLVE IT
1455-138263-0016 WOULD THEY DECIDE FOR OR AGAINST IT MICHEL ARDAN PERSUADED HIS TWO FRIENDS TO FORM AN OPINION AND ASKED THEM DIRECTLY IF THEY THOUGHT THAT MEN AND ANIMALS WERE REPRESENTED IN THE LUNAR WORLD
1455-138263-0017 I THINK THAT WE CAN ANSWER SAID BARBICANE BUT ACCORDING TO MY IDEA THE QUESTION OUGHT NOT TO BE PUT IN THAT FORM I ASK IT TO BE PUT DIFFERENTLY PUT IT YOUR OWN WAY REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0018 HERE IT IS CONTINUED BARBICANE THE PROBLEM IS A DOUBLE ONE AND REQUIRES A DOUBLE SOLUTION IS THE MOON HABITABLE HAS THE MOON EVER BEEN INHABITABLE GOOD
1455-138263-0019 REPLIED NICHOLL FIRST LET US SEE WHETHER THE MOON IS HABITABLE TO TELL THE TRUTH I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT ANSWERED MICHEL AND I ANSWER IN THE NEGATIVE CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0020 IN HER ACTUAL STATE WITH HER SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE CERTAINLY VERY MUCH REDUCED HER SEAS FOR THE MOST PART DRIED UP HER INSUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF WATER RESTRICTED VEGETATION SUDDEN ALTERNATIONS OF COLD AND HEAT
1455-138263-0021 HER DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS THE MOON DOES NOT SEEM HABITABLE TO ME NOR DOES SHE SEEM PROPITIOUS TO ANIMAL DEVELOPMENT NOR SUFFICIENT FOR THE WANTS OF EXISTENCE AS WE UNDERSTAND IT
1455-138263-0022 AGREED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT IS NOT THE MOON HABITABLE FOR CREATURES DIFFERENTLY ORGANIZED FROM OURSELVES
1455-138263-0023 SEEMED TO US TO MOVE ON THE MOON'S SURFACE
1455-138263-0024 AND WHAT HAVE WE SEEN EVERYWHERE AND ALWAYS THE GEOLOGICAL WORKS OF NATURE NEVER THE WORK OF MAN IF THEN THERE EXIST REPRESENTATIVES OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM ON THE MOON
1455-138263-0025 THEY MUST HAVE FLED TO THOSE UNFATHOMABLE CAVITIES WHICH THE EYE CANNOT REACH WHICH I CANNOT ADMIT FOR THEY MUST HAVE LEFT TRACES OF THEIR PASSAGE ON THOSE PLAINS WHICH THE ATMOSPHERE MUST COVER HOWEVER SLIGHTLY RAISED IT MAY BE
1455-138263-0026 THESE TRACES ARE NOWHERE VISIBLE THERE REMAINS BUT ONE HYPOTHESIS THAT OF A LIVING RACE TO WHICH MOTION WHICH IS LIFE IS FOREIGN ONE MIGHT AS WELL SAY LIVING CREATURES WHICH DO NOT LIVE REPLIED MICHEL
1455-138263-0027 THE SCIENTIFIC COMMISSION ASSEMBLED IN THE PROJECTILE OF THE GUN CLUB AFTER HAVING FOUNDED THEIR ARGUMENT ON FACTS RECENTLY OBSERVED DECIDE UNANIMOUSLY UPON THE QUESTION OF THE HABITABILITY OF THE MOON NO THE MOON
1455-138263-0028 SAID NICHOLL LET US ATTACK THE SECOND QUESTION AN INDISPENSABLE COMPLEMENT OF THE FIRST I ASK THE HONORABLE COMMISSION IF THE MOON IS NOT HABITABLE HAS SHE EVER BEEN INHABITED CITIZEN BARBICANE
1455-138263-0029 MY FRIENDS REPLIED BARBICANE I DID NOT UNDERTAKE THIS JOURNEY IN ORDER TO FORM AN OPINION ON THE PAST HABITABILITY OF OUR SATELLITE BUT I WILL ADD THAT OUR PERSONAL OBSERVATIONS ONLY CONFIRM ME IN THIS OPINION
1455-138263-0030 I BELIEVE INDEED I AFFIRM THAT THE MOON HAS BEEN INHABITED BY A HUMAN RACE ORGANIZED LIKE OUR OWN THAT SHE HAS PRODUCED ANIMALS ANATOMICALLY FORMED LIKE THE TERRESTRIAL ANIMALS
1455-138263-0031 BUT I ADD THAT THESE RACES HUMAN AND ANIMAL HAVE HAD THEIR DAY AND ARE NOW FOREVER EXTINCT
1455-138263-0032 RELATIVELY THE ORGANIZING FORCE OF MATTER HAS BEEN MUCH MORE VIOLENT IN THE INTERIOR OF THE MOON THAN IN THE INTERIOR OF THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE THE ACTUAL STATE OF THIS CRACKED TWISTED AND BURST DISC ABUNDANTLY PROVES THIS
1455-138263-0033 THE MOON AND THE EARTH WERE NOTHING BUT GASEOUS MASSES ORIGINALLY
1455-138263-0034 CONTINUED BARBICANE AN ATMOSPHERE SURROUNDED IT
1455-138263-0035 FOR EXAMPLE ITS DAYS AND NIGHTS OF THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AT THE TERRESTRIAL POLES THEY LAST SIX MONTHS SAID MICHEL AN ARGUMENT OF LITTLE VALUE SINCE THE POLES ARE NOT INHABITED LET US OBSERVE MY FRIENDS CONTINUED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0036 THAT IF IN THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE MOON ITS LONG NIGHTS AND LONG DAYS CREATED DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE INSUPPORTABLE TO ORGANIZATION IT WAS NOT SO AT THE HISTORICAL PERIOD OF TIME THE ATMOSPHERE ENVELOPED THE DISC WITH A FLUID MANTLE
1455-138263-0037 VAPOR DEPOSITED ITSELF IN THE SHAPE OF CLOUDS THIS NATURAL SCREEN TEMPERED THE ARDOR OF THE SOLAR RAYS AND RETAINED THE NOCTURNAL RADIATION
1455-138263-0038 LIGHT LIKE HEAT CAN DIFFUSE ITSELF IN THE AIR HENCE AN EQUALITY BETWEEN THE INFLUENCES WHICH NO LONGER EXISTS NOW THAT ATMOSPHERE HAS ALMOST ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED AND NOW I AM GOING TO ASTONISH YOU
1455-138263-0039 ASTONISH US SAID MICHEL ARDAN I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE MOON WAS INHABITED THE NIGHTS AND DAYS DID NOT LAST THREE HUNDRED FIFTY FOUR HOURS AND WHY
1455-138263-0040 ASKED NICHOLL QUICKLY BECAUSE MOST PROBABLY THEN THE ROTARY MOTION OF THE MOON UPON HER AXIS WAS NOT EQUAL TO HER REVOLUTION AN EQUALITY WHICH PRESENTS EACH PART OF HER DISC DURING FIFTEEN DAYS TO THE ACTION OF THE SOLAR RAYS
1455-138263-0041 GRANTED REPLIED NICHOLL BUT WHY SHOULD NOT THESE TWO MOTIONS HAVE BEEN EQUAL AS THEY ARE REALLY SO BECAUSE THAT EQUALITY HAS ONLY BEEN DETERMINED BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION
1455-138263-0042 AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THIS ATTRACTION WAS POWERFUL ENOUGH TO ALTER THE MOTION OF THE MOON AT THAT PERIOD WHEN THE EARTH WAS STILL FLUID JUST SO REPLIED NICHOLL AND WHO CAN SAY THAT THE MOON HAS ALWAYS BEEN A SATELLITE OF THE EARTH
1455-138263-0043 EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN THAT THE MOON DID NOT EXIST BEFORE THE EARTH THEIR IMAGINATIONS CARRIED THEM AWAY INTO AN INDEFINITE FIELD OF HYPOTHESIS BARBICANE SOUGHT TO RESTRAIN THEM
1455-138263-0044 THOSE SPECULATIONS ARE TOO HIGH SAID HE PROBLEMS UTTERLY INSOLUBLE
1455-138263-0045 LET US ONLY ADMIT THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THE PRIMORDIAL ATTRACTION AND THEN BY THE INEQUALITY OF THE TWO MOTIONS OF ROTATION AND REVOLUTION
1455-138263-0046 BESIDES EVEN WITHOUT THESE CONDITIONS LIFE WAS POSSIBLE AND SO ASKED MICHEL ARDAN HUMANITY HAS DISAPPEARED FROM THE MOON YES REPLIED BARBICANE
1455-138263-0047 AFTER HAVING DOUBTLESS REMAINED PERSISTENTLY FOR MILLIONS OF CENTURIES
1455-138263-0048 AS THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE WILL ONE DAY BECOME BY COOLING BY COOLING CERTAINLY REPLIED BARBICANE AS THE INTERNAL FIRES BECAME EXTINGUISHED
1455-138263-0049 AND THE INCANDESCENT MATTER CONCENTRATED ITSELF THE LUNAR CRUST COOLED BY DEGREES THE CONSEQUENCES OF THESE PHENOMENA SHOWED THEMSELVES IN THE DISAPPEARANCE OF ORGANIZED BEINGS AND BY THE DISAPPEARANCE OF VEGETATION SOON THE ATMOSPHERE WAS RAREFIED
1455-138263-0050 PROBABLY WITHDRAWN BY TERRESTRIAL ATTRACTION THEN AERIAL DEPARTURE OF RESPIRABLE AIR AND DISAPPEARANCE OF WATER BY MEANS OF EVAPORATION AT THIS PERIOD THE MOON BECOMING UNINHABITABLE WAS NO LONGER INHABITED IT WAS A DEAD WORLD
1455-138263-0051 AND HAVE THEY CALCULATED THE TIME WHICH OUR UNFORTUNATE SPHERE WILL TAKE TO COOL CERTAINLY AND YOU KNOW THESE CALCULATIONS PERFECTLY
1455-138263-0052 BUT SPEAK THEN MY CLUMSY SAVANT EXCLAIMED MICHEL ARDAN FOR YOU MAKE ME BOIL WITH IMPATIENCE VERY WELL MY GOOD MICHEL REPLIED BARBICANE QUIETLY WE KNOW WHAT DIMINUTION OF TEMPERATURE THE EARTH UNDERGOES IN THE LAPSE OF A CENTURY
1455-138263-0053 BE BROUGHT DOWN TO ZERO FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS EXCLAIMED MICHEL AH I BREATHE AGAIN REALLY I WAS FRIGHTENED TO HEAR YOU I IMAGINED THAT WE HAD NOT MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND YEARS TO LIVE
1455-138263-0054 BARBICANE AND NICHOLL COULD NOT HELP LAUGHING AT THEIR COMPANION'S UNEASINESS
1455-138263-0055 WHICH HAD JUST BEEN CONSIDERED AGAIN HAS THE MOON BEEN INHABITED HE ASKED THE ANSWER WAS UNANIMOUSLY IN THE AFFIRMATIVE BUT DURING THIS DISCUSSION FRUITFUL IN SOMEWHAT HAZARDOUS THEORIES
1455-138263-0056 THE PROJECTILE WAS RAPIDLY LEAVING THE MOON THE LINEAMENTS FADED AWAY FROM THE TRAVELERS EYES MOUNTAINS WERE CONFUSED IN THE DISTANCE AND OF ALL THE WONDERFUL STRANGE AND FANTASTICAL FORM OF THE EARTH'S SATELLITE THERE SOON REMAINED NOTHING
150-126107-0000 BUT AS SURE AS HE FOUND A PRINCESS HE FOUND SOME FAULT IN HER OF COURSE HE COULD NOT MARRY A MERE WOMAN HOWEVER BEAUTIFUL AND THERE WAS NO PRINCESS TO BE FOUND WORTHY OF HIM
150-126107-0001 WHETHER THE PRINCE WAS SO NEAR PERFECTION THAT HE HAD A RIGHT TO DEMAND PERFECTION ITSELF I CANNOT PRETEND TO SAY ALL I KNOW IS THAT HE WAS A FINE HANDSOME
150-126107-0002 BRAVE GENEROUS WELL BRED AND WELL BEHAVED YOUTH AS ALL PRINCES ARE IN HIS WANDERINGS HE HAD COME ACROSS SOME REPORTS ABOUT OUR PRINCESS
150-126107-0003 HE NEVER DREAMED THAT SHE COULD BEWITCH HIM FOR WHAT INDEED COULD A PRINCE DO WITH A PRINCESS THAT HAD LOST HER GRAVITY WHO COULD TELL WHAT SHE MIGHT NOT LOSE NEXT SHE MIGHT LOSE HER VISIBILITY OR HER TANGIBILITY
150-126107-0004 OR IN SHORT THE POWER OF MAKING IMPRESSIONS UPON THE RADICAL SENSORIUM SO THAT HE SHOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS DEAD OR ALIVE OF COURSE HE MADE NO FURTHER INQUIRIES ABOUT HER
150-126107-0005 ONE DAY HE LOST SIGHT OF HIS RETINUE IN A GREAT FOREST THESE FORESTS ARE VERY USEFUL IN DELIVERING PRINCES FROM THEIR COURTIERS LIKE A SIEVE THAT KEEPS BACK THE BRAN THEN THE PRINCES GET AWAY TO FOLLOW THEIR FORTUNES
150-126107-0006 IN THIS WAY THEY HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF THE PRINCESSES WHO ARE FORCED TO MARRY BEFORE THEY HAVE HAD A BIT OF FUN I WISH OUR PRINCESSES GOT LOST IN A FOREST SOMETIMES ONE LOVELY EVENING AFTER WANDERING ABOUT FOR MANY DAYS
150-126107-0007 HE FOUND THAT HE WAS APPROACHING THE OUTSKIRTS OF THIS FOREST FOR THE TREES HAD GOT SO THIN THAT HE COULD SEE THE SUNSET THROUGH THEM AND HE SOON CAME UPON A KIND OF HEATH NEXT HE CAME UPON SIGNS OF HUMAN NEIGHBOURHOOD
150-126107-0008 AT LENGTH HE ENTERED ANOTHER WOOD NOT A WILD FOREST BUT A CIVILIZED WOOD THROUGH WHICH A FOOTPATH LED HIM TO THE SIDE OF A LAKE ALONG THIS PATH THE PRINCE PURSUED HIS WAY THROUGH THE GATHERING DARKNESS
150-126107-0009 SUDDENLY HE PAUSED AND LISTENED STRANGE SOUNDS CAME ACROSS THE WATER IT WAS IN FACT THE PRINCESS LAUGHING NOW THERE WAS SOMETHING ODD IN HER LAUGH AS I HAVE ALREADY HINTED
150-126107-0010 FOR THE HATCHING OF A REAL HEARTY LAUGH REQUIRES THE INCUBATION OF GRAVITY AND PERHAPS THIS WAS HOW THE PRINCE MISTOOK THE LAUGHTER FOR SCREAMING LOOKING OVER THE LAKE HE SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN THE WATER AND IN AN INSTANT HE HAD TORN OFF HIS TUNIC
150-126107-0011 NOW I CANNOT TELL HOW IT CAME ABOUT WHETHER SHE PRETENDED TO BE DROWNING OR WHETHER HE FRIGHTENED HER OR CAUGHT HER SO AS TO EMBARRASS HER BUT CERTAINLY HE BROUGHT HER TO SHORE IN A FASHION IGNOMINIOUS TO A SWIMMER
150-126107-0012 AND MORE NEARLY DROWNED THAN SHE HAD EVER EXPECTED TO BE FOR THE WATER HAD GOT INTO HER THROAT AS OFTEN AS SHE HAD TRIED TO SPEAK AT THE PLACE TO WHICH HE BORE HER THE BANK WAS ONLY A FOOT OR TWO ABOVE THE WATER
150-126107-0013 SO HE GAVE HER A STRONG LIFT OUT OF THE WATER TO LAY HER ON THE BANK BUT HER GRAVITATION CEASING THE MOMENT SHE LEFT THE WATER AWAY SHE WENT UP INTO THE AIR SCOLDING AND SCREAMING
150-126107-0014 YOU NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY NAUGHTY MAN SHE CRIED NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN PUTTING HER INTO A PASSION BEFORE WHEN THE PRINCE SAW HER ASCEND HE THOUGHT HE MUST HAVE BEEN BEWITCHED
150-126107-0015 THE PRINCE MEANTIME STOOD IN THE WATER STARING AND FORGETTING TO GET OUT BUT THE PRINCESS DISAPPEARING HE SCRAMBLED ON SHORE AND WENT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE TREE
150-126107-0016 UNTIL REACHING THE GROUND AND SEEING HIM STANDING THERE SHE CAUGHT HOLD OF HIM AND SAID I'LL TELL PAPA OH NO YOU WON'T RETURNED THE PRINCE YES I WILL SHE PERSISTED
150-126107-0017 WHAT BUSINESS HAD YOU TO PULL ME DOWN OUT OF THE WATER AND THROW ME TO THE BOTTOM OF THE AIR I NEVER DID YOU ANY HARM PARDON ME I DID NOT MEAN TO HURT YOU I DON'T BELIEVE YOU HAVE ANY BRAINS AND THAT IS A WORSE LOSS THAN YOUR WRETCHED GRAVITY
150-126107-0018 I PITY YOU THE PRINCE NOW SAW THAT HE HAD COME UPON THE BEWITCHED PRINCESS AND HAD ALREADY OFFENDED HER BUT BEFORE HE COULD THINK WHAT TO SAY NEXT SHE BURST OUT ANGRILY GIVING A STAMP WITH HER FOOT
150-126107-0019 THAT WOULD HAVE SENT HER ALOFT AGAIN BUT FOR THE HOLD SHE HAD OF HIS ARM PUT ME UP DIRECTLY PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE HE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HER ALMOST ALREADY
150-126107-0020 FOR HER ANGER MADE HER MORE CHARMING THAN ANY ONE ELSE HAD EVER BEHELD HER AND AS FAR AS HE COULD SEE WHICH CERTAINLY WAS NOT FAR SHE HAD NOT A SINGLE FAULT ABOUT HER EXCEPT OF COURSE THAT SHE HAD NOT ANY GRAVITY
150-126107-0021 NO PRINCE HOWEVER WOULD JUDGE OF A PRINCESS BY WEIGHT THE LOVELINESS OF HER FOOT HE WOULD HARDLY ESTIMATE BY THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION IT COULD MAKE IN MUD PUT YOU UP WHERE YOU BEAUTY ASKED THE PRINCE IN THE WATER YOU STUPID
150-126107-0022 ANSWERED THE PRINCESS COME THEN SAID THE PRINCE THE CONDITION OF HER DRESS INCREASING HER USUAL DIFFICULTY IN WALKING COMPELLED HER TO CLING TO HIM AND HE COULD HARDLY PERSUADE HIMSELF THAT HE WAS NOT IN A DELIGHTFUL DREAM
150-126107-0023 HE TURNED TOWARDS THE PRINCESS AND SAID HOW AM I TO PUT YOU IN THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS SHE ANSWERED QUITE SNAPPISHLY
150-126107-0024 VERY WELL SAID THE PRINCE AND CATCHING HER UP IN HIS ARMS HE SPRANG WITH HER FROM THE ROCK THE PRINCESS HAD JUST TIME TO GIVE ONE DELIGHTED SHRIEK OF LAUGHTER BEFORE THE WATER CLOSED OVER THEM
150-126107-0025 IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE GOING UP REJOINED SHE MY FEELING WAS CERTAINLY ONE OF ELEVATION TOO THE PRINCE CONCEDED THE PRINCESS DID NOT APPEAR TO UNDERSTAND HIM FOR SHE RETORTED HIS QUESTION
150-126107-0026 SAID THE PRINCESS BEYOND EVERYTHING ANSWERED HE FOR I HAVE FALLEN IN WITH THE ONLY PERFECT CREATURE I EVER SAW NO MORE OF THAT I AM TIRED OF IT SAID THE PRINCESS PERHAPS SHE SHARED HER FATHER'S AVERSION TO PUNNING
150-126107-0027 DON'T YOU LIKE FALLING IN THEN SAID THE PRINCE IT IS THE MOST DELIGHTFUL FUN I EVER HAD IN MY LIFE ANSWERED SHE I NEVER FELL BEFORE I WISH I COULD LEARN
150-126107-0028 TO THINK I AM THE ONLY PERSON IN MY FATHER'S KINGDOM THAT CAN'T FALL HERE THE POOR PRINCESS LOOKED ALMOST SAD I SHALL BE MOST HAPPY TO FALL IN WITH YOU ANY TIME YOU LIKE SAID THE PRINCE DEVOTEDLY THANK YOU
150-126107-0029 I DON'T KNOW PERHAPS IT WOULD NOT BE PROPER BUT I DON'T CARE AT ALL EVENTS AS WE HAVE FALLEN IN LET US HAVE A SWIM TOGETHER WITH ALL MY HEART RESPONDED THE PRINCE
150-126107-0030 AND AWAY THEY WENT SWIMMING AND DIVING AND FLOATING UNTIL AT LAST THEY HEARD CRIES ALONG THE SHORE AND SAW LIGHTS GLANCING IN ALL DIRECTIONS IT WAS NOW QUITE LATE AND THERE WAS NO MOON I MUST GO HOME SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126107-0031 AT LEAST I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW WHERE IT IS I WISH I HADN'T ONE EITHER REJOINED THE PRINCESS IT IS SO STUPID I HAVE A GREAT MIND SHE CONTINUED TO PLAY THEM ALL A TRICK WHY COULDN'T THEY LEAVE ME ALONE
150-126107-0032 THEY WON'T TRUST ME IN THE LAKE FOR A SINGLE NIGHT YOU SEE WHERE THAT GREEN LIGHT IS BURNING THAT IS THE WINDOW OF MY ROOM NOW IF YOU WOULD JUST SWIM THERE WITH ME VERY QUIETLY AND WHEN WE ARE ALL BUT UNDER THE BALCONY
150-126107-0033 AS YOU DID A LITTLE WHILE AGO I SHOULD BE ABLE TO CATCH HOLD OF THE BALCONY AND GET IN AT THE WINDOW AND THEN THEY MAY LOOK FOR ME TILL TO MORROW MORNING WITH MORE OBEDIENCE THAN PLEASURE SAID THE PRINCE GALLANTLY AND AWAY THEY SWAM VERY GENTLY
150-126107-0034 WILL YOU BE IN THE LAKE TO MORROW NIGHT THE PRINCE VENTURED TO ASK TO BE SURE I WILL I DON'T THINK SO PERHAPS WAS THE PRINCESS'S SOMEWHAT STRANGE ANSWER
150-126107-0035 AND MERELY WHISPERED AS HE GAVE HER THE PARTING LIFT DON'T TELL THE ONLY ANSWER THE PRINCESS RETURNED WAS A ROGUISH LOOK SHE WAS ALREADY A YARD ABOVE HIS HEAD THE LOOK SEEMED TO SAY NEVER FEAR IT IS TOO GOOD FUN TO SPOIL THAT WAY
150-126107-0036 SO PERFECTLY LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAD SHE BEEN IN THE WATER THAT EVEN YET THE PRINCE COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE HIS EYES WHEN HE SAW HER ASCEND SLOWLY GRASP THE BALCONY AND DISAPPEAR THROUGH THE WINDOW
150-126107-0037 HE TURNED ALMOST EXPECTING TO SEE HER STILL BY HIS SIDE BUT HE WAS ALONE IN THE WATER SO HE SWAM AWAY QUIETLY AND WATCHED THE LIGHTS ROVING ABOUT THE SHORE FOR HOURS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS SAFE IN HER CHAMBER
150-126107-0038 AS SOON AS THEY DISAPPEARED HE LANDED IN SEARCH OF HIS TUNIC AND SWORD AND AFTER SOME TROUBLE FOUND THEM AGAIN THEN HE MADE THE BEST OF HIS WAY ROUND THE LAKE TO THE OTHER SIDE THERE THE WOOD WAS WILDER
150-126107-0039 AND THE SHORE STEEPER RISING MORE IMMEDIATELY TOWARDS THE MOUNTAINS WHICH SURROUNDED THE LAKE ON ALL SIDES AND KEPT SENDING IT MESSAGES OF SILVERY STREAMS FROM MORNING TO NIGHT AND ALL NIGHT LONG HE SOON FOUND A SPOT WHENCE HE COULD SEE THE GREEN LIGHT IN THE PRINCESS'S ROOM
150-126107-0040 AND WHERE EVEN IN THE BROAD DAYLIGHT HE WOULD BE IN NO DANGER OF BEING DISCOVERED FROM THE OPPOSITE SHORE IT WAS A SORT OF CAVE IN THE ROCK WHERE HE PROVIDED HIMSELF A BED OF WITHERED LEAVES AND LAY DOWN TOO TIRED FOR HUNGER TO KEEP HIM AWAKE
150-126112-0000 THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU THE PRINCE WENT TO DRESS FOR THE OCCASION FOR HE WAS RESOLVED TO DIE LIKE A PRINCE WHEN THE PRINCESS HEARD THAT A MAN HAD OFFERED TO DIE FOR HER
150-126112-0001 SHE WAS SO TRANSPORTED THAT SHE JUMPED OFF THE BED FEEBLE AS SHE WAS AND DANCED ABOUT THE ROOM FOR JOY SHE DID NOT CARE WHO THE MAN WAS THAT WAS NOTHING TO HER THE HOLE WANTED STOPPING AND IF ONLY A MAN WOULD DO WHY TAKE ONE
150-126112-0002 WHERE THEY HAD ALREADY PLACED A LITTLE BOAT FOR HER THE WATER WAS NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO FLOAT IT BUT THEY HOPED IT WOULD BE BEFORE LONG THEY LAID HER ON CUSHIONS PLACED IN THE BOAT WINES AND FRUITS AND OTHER NICE THINGS AND STRETCHED A CANOPY OVER ALL
150-126112-0003 IN A FEW MINUTES THE PRINCE APPEARED THE PRINCESS RECOGNIZED HIM AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THINK IT WORTH WHILE TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIM HERE I AM SAID THE PRINCE PUT ME IN
150-126112-0004 THEY TOLD ME IT WAS A SHOEBLACK SAID THE PRINCESS SO I AM SAID THE PRINCE I BLACKED YOUR LITTLE BOOTS THREE TIMES A DAY BECAUSE THEY WERE ALL I COULD GET OF YOU PUT ME IN
150-126112-0005 THE COURTIERS DID NOT RESENT HIS BLUNTNESS EXCEPT BY SAYING TO EACH OTHER THAT HE WAS TAKING IT OUT IN IMPUDENCE BUT HOW WAS HE TO BE PUT IN THE GOLDEN PLATE CONTAINED NO INSTRUCTIONS ON THIS POINT
150-126112-0006 THE PRINCE LOOKED AT THE HOLE AND SAW BUT ONE WAY HE PUT BOTH HIS LEGS INTO IT SITTING ON THE STONE AND STOOPING FORWARD COVERED THE CORNER THAT REMAINED OPEN WITH HIS TWO HANDS IN THIS UNCOMFORTABLE POSITION
150-126112-0007 HE RESOLVED TO ABIDE HIS FATE AND TURNING TO THE PEOPLE SAID NOW YOU CAN GO THE KING HAD ALREADY GONE HOME TO DINNER NOW YOU CAN GO REPEATED THE PRINCESS AFTER HIM LIKE A PARROT
150-126112-0008 THE PEOPLE OBEYED HER AND WENT PRESENTLY A LITTLE WAVE FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED ONE OF THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT MIND IT MUCH
150-126112-0009 AND A LONG PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS IS VERY KIND OF YOU PRINCE SAID THE PRINCESS AT LAST QUITE COOLLY AS SHE LAY IN THE BOAT WITH HER EYES SHUT I AM SORRY I CAN'T RETURN THE COMPLIMENT
150-126112-0010 THOUGHT THE PRINCE BUT YOU ARE WORTH DYING FOR AFTER ALL AGAIN A WAVELET AND ANOTHER AND ANOTHER FLOWED OVER THE STONE AND WETTED BOTH THE PRINCE'S KNEES BUT HE DID NOT SPEAK OR MOVE
150-126112-0011 TWO THREE FOUR HOURS PASSED IN THIS WAY THE PRINCESS APPARENTLY ASLEEP AND THE PRINCE VERY PATIENT BUT HE WAS MUCH DISAPPOINTED IN HIS POSITION FOR HE HAD NONE OF THE CONSOLATION HE HAD HOPED FOR
150-126112-0012 AT LAST HE COULD BEAR IT NO LONGER PRINCESS SAID HE BUT AT THE MOMENT UP STARTED THE PRINCESS CRYING I'M AFLOAT I'M AFLOAT AND THE LITTLE BOAT BUMPED AGAINST THE STONE PRINCESS
150-126112-0013 REPEATED THE PRINCE ENCOURAGED BY SEEING HER WIDE AWAKE AND LOOKING EAGERLY AT THE WATER WELL SAID SHE WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND
150-126112-0014 AND YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT ME ONCE DID HE THEN I SUPPOSE I MUST BUT I AM SO SLEEPY SLEEP THEN DARLING AND DON'T MIND ME SAID THE POOR PRINCE
150-126112-0015 REPLIED THE PRINCESS I THINK I WILL GO TO SLEEP AGAIN JUST GIVE ME A GLASS OF WINE AND A BISCUIT FIRST SAID THE PRINCE VERY HUMBLY WITH ALL MY HEART SAID THE PRINCESS AND GAPED AS SHE SAID IT
150-126112-0016 FEELING VERY FAINT INDEED ONLY I SHALL DIE BEFORE IT IS OF ANY USE TO YOU UNLESS I HAVE SOMETHING TO EAT THERE THEN SAID SHE HOLDING OUT THE WINE TO HIM AH YOU MUST FEED ME I DARE NOT MOVE MY HANDS
150-126112-0017 AND SHE BEGAN AT ONCE TO FEED HIM WITH BITS OF BISCUIT AND SIPS OF WINE AS SHE FED HIM HE CONTRIVED TO KISS THE TIPS OF HER FINGERS NOW AND THEN SHE DID NOT SEEM TO MIND IT ONE WAY OR THE OTHER BUT THE PRINCE FELT BETTER
150-126112-0018 NOW FOR YOUR OWN SAKE PRINCESS SAID HE I CANNOT LET YOU GO TO SLEEP YOU MUST SIT AND LOOK AT ME ELSE I SHALL NOT BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WELL I WILL DO ANYTHING I CAN TO OBLIGE YOU
150-126112-0019 ANSWERED SHE WITH CONDESCENSION AND SITTING DOWN SHE DID LOOK AT HIM AND KEPT LOOKING AT HIM WITH WONDERFUL STEADINESS CONSIDERING ALL THINGS THE SUN WENT DOWN AND THE MOON ROSE
150-126112-0020 AND GUSH AFTER GUSH THE WATERS WERE RISING UP THE PRINCE'S BODY THEY WERE UP TO HIS WAIST NOW WHY CAN'T WE GO AND HAVE A SWIM SAID THE PRINCESS
150-126112-0021 I SHALL NEVER SWIM MORE SAID THE PRINCE OH I FORGOT SAID THE PRINCESS AND WAS SILENT SO THE WATER GREW AND GREW AND ROSE UP AND UP ON THE PRINCE
150-126112-0022 AND THE PRINCESS SAT AND LOOKED AT HIM SHE FED HIM NOW AND THEN THE NIGHT WORE ON THE WATERS ROSE AND ROSE THE MOON ROSE LIKEWISE HIGHER AND HIGHER
150-126112-0023 AND SHONE FULL ON THE FACE OF THE DYING PRINCE THE WATER WAS UP TO HIS NECK WILL YOU KISS ME PRINCESS SAID HE FEEBLY THE NONCHALANCE WAS ALL GONE NOW
150-126112-0024 YES I WILL ANSWERED THE PRINCESS AND KISSED HIM WITH A LONG SWEET COLD KISS NOW SAID HE WITH A SIGH OF CONTENT I DIE HAPPY
150-126112-0025 HE DID NOT SPEAK AGAIN THE PRINCESS GAVE HIM SOME WINE FOR THE LAST TIME HE WAS PAST EATING THEN SHE SAT DOWN AGAIN AND LOOKED AT HIM THE WATER ROSE AND ROSE
150-126112-0026 IT TOUCHED HIS CHIN IT TOUCHED HIS LOWER LIP IT TOUCHED BETWEEN HIS LIPS HE SHUT THEM HARD TO KEEP IT OUT THE PRINCESS BEGAN TO FEEL STRANGE IT TOUCHED HIS UPPER LIP
150-126112-0027 HE BREATHED THROUGH HIS NOSTRILS THE PRINCESS LOOKED WILD IT COVERED HIS NOSTRILS HER EYES LOOKED SCARED AND SHONE STRANGE IN THE MOONLIGHT HIS HEAD FELL BACK THE WATER CLOSED OVER IT
150-126112-0028 AND THE BUBBLES OF HIS LAST BREATH BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER THE PRINCESS GAVE A SHRIEK AND SPRANG INTO THE LAKE SHE LAID HOLD FIRST OF ONE LEG AND THEN OF THE OTHER AND PULLED AND TUGGED BUT SHE COULD NOT MOVE EITHER SHE STOPPED TO TAKE BREATH
150-126112-0029 AND THAT MADE HER THINK THAT HE COULD NOT GET ANY BREATH SHE WAS FRANTIC SHE GOT HOLD OF HIM AND HELD HIS HEAD ABOVE THE WATER WHICH WAS POSSIBLE NOW HIS HANDS WERE NO LONGER ON THE HOLE BUT IT WAS OF NO USE FOR HE WAS PAST BREATHING
150-126112-0030 LOVE AND WATER BROUGHT BACK ALL HER STRENGTH SHE GOT UNDER THE WATER AND PULLED AND PULLED WITH HER WHOLE MIGHT TILL AT LAST SHE GOT ONE LEG OUT THE OTHER EASILY FOLLOWED HOW SHE GOT HIM INTO THE BOAT SHE NEVER COULD TELL
150-126112-0031 BUT WHEN SHE DID SHE FAINTED AWAY COMING TO HERSELF SHE SEIZED THE OARS KEPT HERSELF STEADY AS BEST SHE COULD AND ROWED AND ROWED THOUGH SHE HAD NEVER ROWED BEFORE ROUND ROCKS AND OVER SHALLOWS AND THROUGH MUD SHE ROWED
150-126112-0032 TILL SHE GOT TO THE LANDING STAIRS OF THE PALACE BY THIS TIME HER PEOPLE WERE ON THE SHORE FOR THEY HAD HEARD HER SHRIEK SHE MADE THEM CARRY THE PRINCE TO HER OWN ROOM AND LAY HIM IN HER BED AND LIGHT A FIRE AND SEND FOR THE DOCTORS
150-126112-0033 BUT THE LAKE YOUR HIGHNESS SAID THE CHAMBERLAIN WHO ROUSED BY THE NOISE CAME IN IN HIS NIGHTCAP GO AND DROWN YOURSELF IN IT SHE SAID THIS WAS THE LAST RUDENESS OF WHICH THE PRINCESS WAS EVER GUILTY
150-126112-0034 AND ONE MUST ALLOW THAT SHE HAD GOOD CAUSE TO FEEL PROVOKED WITH THE LORD CHAMBERLAIN HAD IT BEEN THE KING HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE FARED NO BETTER BUT BOTH HE AND THE QUEEN WERE FAST ASLEEP AND THE CHAMBERLAIN WENT BACK TO HIS BED
150-126112-0035 SOMEHOW THE DOCTORS NEVER CAME SO THE PRINCESS AND HER OLD NURSE WERE LEFT WITH THE PRINCE BUT THE OLD NURSE WAS A WISE WOMAN AND KNEW WHAT TO DO THEY TRIED EVERYTHING FOR A LONG TIME WITHOUT SUCCESS
150-126112-0036 THE PRINCESS WAS NEARLY DISTRACTED BETWEEN HOPE AND FEAR BUT SHE TRIED ON AND ON ONE THING AFTER ANOTHER AND EVERYTHING OVER AND OVER AGAIN AT LAST WHEN THEY HAD ALL BUT GIVEN IT UP JUST AS THE SUN ROSE
150-132655-0000 BUT THE EXTREME IMPERTINENCE OF THE BARON DETERMINED HIM TO CONCLUDE THE MATCH
150-132655-0001 CACAMBO DECIDED THAT IT WOULD BE BETTER TO DELIVER HIM UP AGAIN TO THE CAPTAIN OF THE GALLEY AFTER WHICH THEY THOUGHT TO SEND HIM BACK TO THE GENERAL FATHER OF THE ORDER AT ROME BY THE FIRST SHIP THIS ADVICE WAS WELL RECEIVED THE OLD WOMAN APPROVED IT
150-132655-0002 THEY SAID NOT A WORD TO HIS SISTER THE THING WAS EXECUTED FOR A LITTLE MONEY AND THEY HAD THE DOUBLE PLEASURE OF ENTRAPPING A JESUIT AND PUNISHING THE PRIDE OF A GERMAN BARON
150-132655-0003 IT IS NATURAL TO IMAGINE THAT AFTER SO MANY DISASTERS CANDIDE MARRIED AND LIVING WITH THE PHILOSOPHER PANGLOSS THE PHILOSOPHER MARTIN THE PRUDENT CACAMBO AND THE OLD WOMAN
150-132655-0004 HAVING BESIDES BROUGHT SO MANY DIAMONDS FROM THE COUNTRY OF THE ANCIENT INCAS MUST HAVE LED A VERY HAPPY LIFE BUT HE WAS SO MUCH IMPOSED UPON BY THE JEWS THAT HE HAD NOTHING LEFT EXCEPT HIS SMALL FARM
150-132655-0005 HIS WIFE BECAME UGLIER EVERY DAY MORE PEEVISH AND UNSUPPORTABLE THE OLD WOMAN WAS INFIRM AND EVEN MORE FRETFUL THAN CUNEGONDE CACAMBO WHO WORKED IN THE GARDEN AND TOOK VEGETABLES FOR SALE TO CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0006 AND THEY SAW OTHER CADIS PASHAS AND EFFENDIS COMING TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THE EXILES AND AFTERWARDS EXILED IN THEIR TURN THEY SAW HEADS DECENTLY IMPALED FOR PRESENTATION TO THE SUBLIME PORTE
150-132655-0007 I WANT TO KNOW WHICH IS WORSE TO BE RAVISHED A HUNDRED TIMES BY NEGRO PIRATES
150-132655-0008 IN SHORT TO GO THROUGH ALL THE MISERIES WE HAVE UNDERGONE OR TO STAY HERE AND HAVE NOTHING TO DO
150-132655-0009 THIS DISCOURSE GAVE RISE TO NEW REFLECTIONS AND MARTIN ESPECIALLY CONCLUDED THAT MAN WAS BORN TO LIVE EITHER IN A STATE OF DISTRACTING INQUIETUDE OR OF LETHARGIC DISGUST
150-132655-0010 PANGLOSS OWNED THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SUFFERED HORRIBLY BUT AS HE HAD ONCE ASSERTED THAT EVERYTHING WENT WONDERFULLY WELL HE ASSERTED IT STILL THOUGH HE NO LONGER BELIEVED IT WHAT HELPED TO CONFIRM MARTIN IN HIS DETESTABLE PRINCIPLES
150-132655-0011 THEY HAD SOON SQUANDERED THEIR THREE THOUSAND PIASTRES PARTED WERE RECONCILED QUARRELLED AGAIN
150-132655-0012 THAT YOUR PRESENTS WOULD SOON BE DISSIPATED AND ONLY MAKE THEM THE MORE MISERABLE YOU HAVE ROLLED IN MILLIONS OF MONEY YOU AND CACAMBO
150-132655-0013 HA SAID PANGLOSS TO PAQUETTE PROVIDENCE HAS THEN BROUGHT YOU AMONGST US AGAIN MY POOR CHILD DO YOU KNOW THAT YOU COST ME THE TIP OF MY NOSE AN EYE AND AN EAR AS YOU MAY SEE WHAT A WORLD IS THIS
150-132655-0014 AND NOW THIS NEW ADVENTURE SET THEM PHILOSOPHISING MORE THAN EVER IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THERE LIVED A VERY FAMOUS DERVISH WHO WAS ESTEEMED THE BEST PHILOSOPHER IN ALL TURKEY AND THEY WENT TO CONSULT HIM PANGLOSS WAS THE SPEAKER
150-132655-0015 MASTER SAID HE WE COME TO BEG YOU TO TELL WHY SO STRANGE AN ANIMAL AS MAN WAS MADE WITH WHAT MEDDLEST THOU SAID THE DERVISH IS IT THY BUSINESS
150-132655-0016 THERE IS HORRIBLE EVIL IN THIS WORLD WHAT SIGNIFIES IT SAID THE DERVISH WHETHER THERE BE EVIL OR GOOD WHEN HIS HIGHNESS SENDS A SHIP TO EGYPT DOES HE TROUBLE HIS HEAD WHETHER THE MICE ON BOARD ARE AT THEIR EASE OR NOT
150-132655-0017 WHAT THEN MUST WE DO SAID PANGLOSS HOLD YOUR TONGUE ANSWERED THE DERVISH I WAS IN HOPES SAID PANGLOSS THAT I SHOULD REASON WITH YOU A LITTLE ABOUT CAUSES AND EFFECTS ABOUT THE BEST OF POSSIBLE WORLDS THE ORIGIN OF EVIL THE NATURE OF THE SOUL
150-132655-0018 AND THE PRE ESTABLISHED HARMONY AT THESE WORDS THE DERVISH SHUT THE DOOR IN THEIR FACES DURING THIS CONVERSATION THE NEWS WAS SPREAD THAT TWO VIZIERS AND THE MUFTI HAD BEEN STRANGLED AT CONSTANTINOPLE AND THAT SEVERAL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAD BEEN IMPALED
150-132655-0019 ASKED THE OLD MAN WHAT WAS THE NAME OF THE STRANGLED MUFTI I DO NOT KNOW ANSWERED THE WORTHY MAN AND I HAVE NOT KNOWN THE NAME OF ANY MUFTI NOR OF ANY VIZIER I AM ENTIRELY IGNORANT OF THE EVENT YOU MENTION
150-132655-0020 I PRESUME IN GENERAL THAT THEY WHO MEDDLE WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS DIE SOMETIMES MISERABLY AND THAT THEY DESERVE IT BUT I NEVER TROUBLE MY HEAD ABOUT WHAT IS TRANSACTING AT CONSTANTINOPLE
150-132655-0021 I CONTENT MYSELF WITH SENDING THERE FOR SALE THE FRUITS OF THE GARDEN WHICH I CULTIVATE HAVING SAID THESE WORDS HE INVITED THE STRANGERS INTO HIS HOUSE HIS TWO SONS AND TWO DAUGHTERS PRESENTED THEM WITH SEVERAL SORTS OF SHERBET WHICH THEY MADE THEMSELVES
150-132655-0022 WITH KAIMAK ENRICHED WITH THE CANDIED PEEL OF CITRONS WITH ORANGES LEMONS PINE APPLES PISTACHIO NUTS AND MOCHA COFFEE UNADULTERATED WITH THE BAD COFFEE OF BATAVIA OR THE AMERICAN ISLANDS
150-132655-0023 YOU MUST HAVE A VAST AND MAGNIFICENT ESTATE SAID CANDIDE TO THE TURK I HAVE ONLY TWENTY ACRES REPLIED THE OLD MAN I AND MY CHILDREN CULTIVATE THEM OUR LABOUR PRESERVES US FROM THREE GREAT EVILS WEARINESS VICE AND WANT
150-132655-0024 MADE PROFOUND REFLECTIONS ON THE OLD MAN'S CONVERSATION THIS HONEST TURK SAID HE TO PANGLOSS AND MARTIN SEEMS TO BE IN A SITUATION FAR PREFERABLE TO THAT OF THE SIX KINGS WITH WHOM WE HAD THE HONOUR OF SUPPING
150-132655-0025 GRANDEUR SAID PANGLOSS IS EXTREMELY DANGEROUS ACCORDING TO THE TESTIMONY OF PHILOSOPHERS FOR IN SHORT EGLON KING OF MOAB WAS ASSASSINATED BY EHUD ABSALOM WAS HUNG BY HIS HAIR AND PIERCED WITH THREE DARTS
150-132655-0026 KING NADAB THE SON OF JEROBOAM WAS KILLED BY BAASA
150-132655-0027 ATHALIAH BY JEHOIADA THE KINGS JEHOIAKIM JECONIAH AND ZEDEKIAH WERE LED INTO CAPTIVITY
150-132655-0028 DIONYSIUS OF SYRACUSE PYRRHUS PERSEUS HANNIBAL JUGURTHA ARIOVISTUS CAESAR POMPEY NERO OTHO VITELLIUS DOMITIAN
150-132655-0029 THAT WE MUST CULTIVATE OUR GARDEN YOU ARE RIGHT SAID PANGLOSS FOR WHEN MAN WAS FIRST PLACED IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN HE WAS PUT THERE UT OPERARETUR EUM THAT HE MIGHT CULTIVATE IT WHICH SHOWS THAT MAN WAS NOT BORN TO BE IDLE
150-132655-0030 LET US WORK SAID MARTIN WITHOUT DISPUTING IT IS THE ONLY WAY TO RENDER LIFE TOLERABLE THE WHOLE LITTLE SOCIETY ENTERED INTO THIS LAUDABLE DESIGN ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT ABILITIES THEIR LITTLE PLOT OF LAND PRODUCED PLENTIFUL CROPS
150-132655-0031 BUT SHE BECAME AN EXCELLENT PASTRY COOK
150-132655-0032 THE OLD WOMAN LOOKED AFTER THE LINEN
150-132655-0033 FOR HE MADE A GOOD JOINER AND BECAME A VERY HONEST MAN
150-132655-0034 THERE IS A CONCATENATION OF EVENTS IN THIS BEST OF ALL POSSIBLE WORLDS
150-132655-0035 IF YOU HAD NOT BEEN PUT INTO THE INQUISITION IF YOU HAD NOT WALKED OVER AMERICA IF YOU HAD NOT STABBED THE BARON IF YOU HAD NOT LOST ALL YOUR SHEEP FROM THE FINE COUNTRY OF EL DORADO YOU WOULD NOT BE HERE EATING PRESERVED CITRONS AND PISTACHIO NUTS
1502-122615-0000 POPE'S ILIAD A SINGLE MOMENT SERVED TO CONVINCE THE YOUTH THAT HE WAS MISTAKEN A HAND WAS LAID WITH A POWERFUL PRESSURE ON HIS ARM AND THE LOW VOICE OF UNCAS MUTTERED IN HIS EAR THE HURONS ARE DOGS
1502-122615-0001 THE SIGHT OF A COWARD'S BLOOD CAN NEVER MAKE A WARRIOR TREMBLE THE GRAY HEAD AND THE SAGAMORE ARE SAFE
1502-122615-0002 GO UNCAS AND THE OPEN HAND ARE NOW STRANGERS IT IS ENOUGH
1502-122615-0003 BUT A GENTLE PUSH FROM HIS FRIEND URGED HIM TOWARD THE DOOR AND ADMONISHED HIM OF THE DANGER THAT MIGHT ATTEND THE DISCOVERY OF THEIR INTERCOURSE SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY YIELDING TO THE NECESSITY HE QUITTED THE PLACE AND MINGLED WITH THE THRONG THAT HOVERED NIGH
1502-122615-0004 THE DYING FIRES IN THE CLEARING CAST A DIM AND UNCERTAIN LIGHT ON THE DUSKY FIGURES THAT WERE SILENTLY STALKING TO AND FRO AND OCCASIONALLY A BRIGHTER GLEAM THAN COMMON GLANCED INTO THE LODGE AND EXHIBITED THE FIGURE OF UNCAS
1502-122615-0005 AFTER THIS TERMINATION OF THE SCENE DUNCAN WANDERED AMONG THE LODGES UNQUESTIONED AND UNNOTICED ENDEAVORING TO FIND SOME TRACE OF HER IN WHOSE BEHALF HE INCURRED THE RISK HE RAN
1502-122615-0006 HE RETRACED HIS STEPS TO THE COUNCIL LODGE RESOLVED TO SEEK AND QUESTION DAVID IN ORDER TO PUT AN END TO HIS DOUBTS ON REACHING THE BUILDING WHICH HAD PROVED ALIKE THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT AND THE PLACE OF EXECUTION
1502-122615-0007 THOUGH THE RETURN OF DUNCAN WAS LIKELY TO REMIND THEM OF HIS CHARACTER AND THE SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES OF HIS VISIT IT PRODUCED NO VISIBLE SENSATION SO FAR THE TERRIBLE SCENE THAT HAD JUST OCCURRED
1502-122615-0008 PROVED FAVORABLE TO HIS VIEWS AND HE REQUIRED NO OTHER PROMPTER THAN HIS OWN FEELINGS TO CONVINCE HIM OF THE EXPEDIENCY OF PROFITING BY SO UNEXPECTED AN ADVANTAGE WITHOUT SEEMING TO HESITATE
1502-122615-0009 HE WALKED INTO THE LODGE AND TOOK HIS SEAT WITH A GRAVITY THAT ACCORDED ADMIRABLY WITH THE DEPORTMENT OF HIS HOSTS A HASTY BUT SEARCHING GLANCE SUFFICED TO TELL HIM THAT THOUGH UNCAS STILL REMAINED WHERE HE HAD LEFT HIM
1502-122615-0010 DAVID HAD NOT REAPPEARED NO OTHER RESTRAINT WAS IMPOSED ON THE FORMER THAN THE WATCHFUL LOOKS OF A YOUNG HURON WHO HAD PLACED HIMSELF AT HAND THOUGH AN ARMED WARRIOR LEANED AGAINST THE POST THAT FORMED ONE SIDE OF THE NARROW DOORWAY
1502-122615-0011 IN EVERY OTHER RESPECT THE CAPTIVE SEEMED AT LIBERTY STILL HE WAS EXCLUDED FROM ALL PARTICIPATION IN THE DISCOURSE AND POSSESSED MUCH MORE OF THE AIR OF SOME FINELY MOLDED STATUE THAN A MAN HAVING LIFE AND VOLITION
1502-122615-0012 HE WOULD GREATLY HAVE PREFERRED SILENCE AND MEDITATION TO SPEECH WHEN A DISCOVERY OF HIS REAL CONDITION MIGHT PROVE SO INSTANTLY FATAL UNFORTUNATELY FOR THIS PRUDENT RESOLUTION HIS ENTERTAINERS APPEARED OTHERWISE DISPOSED
1502-122615-0013 HE HAD NOT LONG OCCUPIED THE SEAT WISELY TAKEN A LITTLE IN THE SHADE WHEN ANOTHER OF THE ELDER WARRIORS WHO SPOKE THE FRENCH LANGUAGE ADDRESSED HIM MY CANADA FATHER DOES NOT FORGET HIS CHILDREN SAID THE CHIEF
1502-122615-0014 I THANK HIM AN EVIL SPIRIT LIVES IN THE WIFE OF ONE OF MY YOUNG MEN CAN THE CUNNING STRANGER FRIGHTEN HIM AWAY HEYWARD POSSESSED SOME KNOWLEDGE OF THE MUMMERY PRACTISED AMONG THE INDIANS
1502-122615-0015 IN THE CASES OF SUCH SUPPOSED VISITATIONS HE SAW AT A GLANCE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCE MIGHT POSSIBLY BE IMPROVED TO FURTHER HIS OWN ENDS IT WOULD THEREFORE HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT JUST THEN TO HAVE UTTERED A PROPOSAL
1502-122615-0016 THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIM MORE SATISFACTION AWARE OF THE NECESSITY OF PRESERVING THE DIGNITY OF HIS IMAGINARY CHARACTER HOWEVER HE REPRESSED HIS FEELINGS AND ANSWERED WITH SUITABLE MYSTERY SPIRITS DIFFER
1502-122615-0017 THE HURON WAS CONTENT WITH THE ASSURANCE AND RESUMING HIS PIPE HE AWAITED THE PROPER MOMENT TO MOVE THE IMPATIENT HEYWARD INWARDLY EXECRATING THE COLD CUSTOMS OF THE SAVAGES
1502-122615-0018 EQUAL TO THAT MAINTAINED BY THE CHIEF WHO WAS IN TRUTH A NEAR RELATIVE OF THE AFFLICTED WOMAN THE MINUTES LINGERED AND THE DELAY HAD SEEMED AN HOUR TO THE ADVENTURER IN EMPIRICISM WHEN THE HURON LAID ASIDE HIS PIPE
1502-122615-0019 AND DREW HIS ROBE ACROSS HIS BREAST AS IF ABOUT TO LEAD THE WAY TO THE LODGE OF THE INVALID JUST THEN A WARRIOR OF POWERFUL FRAME DARKENED THE DOOR AND STALKING SILENTLY AMONG THE ATTENTIVE GROUP
1502-122615-0020 HE SEATED HIMSELF ON ONE END OF THE LOW PILE OF BRUSH WHICH SUSTAINED DUNCAN THE LATTER CAST AN IMPATIENT LOOK AT HIS NEIGHBOR AND FELT HIS FLESH CREEP WITH UNCONTROLLABLE HORROR WHEN HE FOUND HIMSELF IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH MAGUA
1502-122615-0021 SEVERAL PIPES THAT HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED WERE LIGHTED AGAIN
1502-122615-0022 DREW HIS TOMAHAWK FROM HIS GIRDLE AND FILLING THE BOWL ON ITS HEAD BEGAN TO INHALE THE VAPORS OF THE WEED THROUGH THE HOLLOW HANDLE
1502-122615-0023 TEN MINUTES WHICH APPEARED SO MANY AGES TO DUNCAN MIGHT HAVE PASSED IN THIS MANNER AND THE WARRIORS WERE FAIRLY ENVELOPED IN A CLOUD OF WHITE SMOKE BEFORE ANY OF THEM SPOKE
1502-122615-0024 HAS MY FRIEND FOUND THE MOOSE THE YOUNG MEN STAGGER UNDER THEIR BURDENS RETURNED MAGUA LET REED THAT BENDS GO ON THE HUNTING PATH HE WILL MEET THEM A DEEP AND AWFUL SILENCE SUCCEEDED THE UTTERANCE OF THE FORBIDDEN NAME
1502-122615-0025 AS THOUGH ALL HAD INHALED AN IMPURITY AT THE SAME INSTANT THE SMOKE WREATHED ABOVE THEIR HEADS IN LITTLE EDDIES
1502-122615-0026 LEAVING THE PLACE BENEATH CLEAR OF ITS FUMES
1502-122615-0027 THE LOOKS OF MOST OF THE WARRIORS WERE RIVETED ON THE EARTH
1502-122615-0028 SUFFERED THEIR WILD AND GLARING EYEBALLS TO ROLL IN THE DIRECTION OF A WHITE HEADED SAVAGE
1502-122615-0029 LIKE MOST AROUND HIM FOR MORE THAN A MINUTE HIS LOOK TOO WAS ON THE GROUND BUT TRUSTING HIS EYES AT LENGTH TO STEAL A GLANCE ASIDE HE PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS BECOMING AN OBJECT OF GENERAL ATTENTION
1502-122615-0030 THEN HE AROSE AND LIFTED HIS VOICE IN THE GENERAL SILENCE IT WAS A LIE HE SAID I HAD NO SON HE WHO WAS CALLED BY THAT NAME IS FORGOTTEN
1502-122615-0031 THE WICKED CHIPPEWAS CHEATED MY SQUAW
1502-122615-0032 HE IS HAPPY WHO KNOWS THAT THE EVIL OF HIS RACE DIES WITH HIMSELF I HAVE DONE THE SPEAKER WHO WAS THE FATHER OF THE RECREANT YOUNG INDIAN LOOKED ROUND AND ABOUT HIM
1502-122615-0033 THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE CONTRADICTED HIS FIGURATIVE AND BOASTFUL LANGUAGE
1502-122615-0034 STANDING A SINGLE MINUTE TO ENJOY HIS BITTER TRIUMPH HE TURNED AWAY AS IF SICKENING AT THE GAZE OF MEN AND VEILING HIS FACE IN HIS BLANKET HE WALKED FROM THE LODGE WITH THE NOISELESS STEP OF AN INDIAN SEEKING
1502-122615-0035 IN THE PRIVACY OF HIS OWN ABODE THE SYMPATHY OF ONE LIKE HIMSELF AGED FORLORN AND CHILDLESS THE INDIANS WHO BELIEVE IN THE HEREDITARY TRANSMISSION OF VIRTUES AND DEFECTS IN CHARACTER
1502-122615-0036 SUFFERED HIM TO DEPART IN SILENCE THEN WITH AN ELEVATION OF BREEDING THAT MANY IN A MORE CULTIVATED STATE OF SOCIETY MIGHT PROFITABLY EMULATE ONE OF THE CHIEFS DREW THE ATTENTION OF THE YOUNG MEN
1502-122615-0037 BUT WHO HAS EVER FOUND A HURON ASLEEP THE DARKNESS OF THE IMPENDING CLOUD WHICH PRECEDES A BURST OF THUNDER WAS NOT BLACKER THAN THE BROW OF MAGUA AS HE EXCLAIMED THE DELAWARES OF THE LAKES
1502-122615-0038 NOT SO THEY WHO WEAR THE PETTICOATS OF SQUAWS ON THEIR OWN RIVER ONE OF THEM HAS BEEN PASSING THE TRIBE DID MY YOUNG MEN TAKE HIS SCALP
1502-122619-0000 BRIEF I PRAY FOR YOU FOR YOU SEE TIS A BUSY TIME WITH ME MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING THE TRIBE OR RATHER HALF TRIBE OF DELAWARES
1502-122619-0001 COULD ASSEMBLE ABOUT AN EQUAL NUMBER OF WARRIORS WITH THE LATTER PEOPLE LIKE THEIR NEIGHBORS THEY HAD FOLLOWED MONTCALM INTO THE TERRITORIES OF THE ENGLISH CROWN AND WERE MAKING HEAVY AND SERIOUS INROADS ON THE HUNTING GROUNDS OF THE MOHAWKS
1502-122619-0002 THOUGH THEY HAD SEEN FIT WITH THE MYSTERIOUS RESERVE SO COMMON AMONG THE NATIVES TO WITHHOLD THEIR ASSISTANCE AT THE MOMENT WHEN IT WAS MOST REQUIRED THE FRENCH HAD ACCOUNTED FOR THIS UNEXPECTED DEFECTION ON THE PART OF THEIR ALLY
1502-122619-0003 IN VARIOUS WAYS IT WAS THE PREVALENT OPINION HOWEVER
1502-122619-0004 THAT HAD ONCE MADE THEM DEPENDENT ON THE SIX NATIONS FOR MILITARY PROTECTION AND NOW RENDERED THEM RELUCTANT TO ENCOUNTER THEIR FORMER MASTERS AS FOR THE TRIBE ITSELF IT HAD BEEN CONTENT TO ANNOUNCE TO MONTCALM THROUGH HIS EMISSARIES WITH INDIAN BREVITY
1502-122619-0005 THAT THEIR HATCHETS WERE DULL AND TIME WAS NECESSARY TO SHARPEN THEM THE POLITIC CAPTAIN OF THE CANADAS HAD DEEMED IT WISER TO SUBMIT TO ENTERTAIN A PASSIVE FRIEND THAN BY ANY ACTS OF ILL JUDGED SEVERITY TO CONVERT HIM INTO AN OPEN ENEMY
1502-122619-0006 ON THAT MORNING WHEN MAGUA LED HIS SILENT PARTY FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF THE BEAVERS INTO THE FORESTS IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED THE SUN ROSE UPON THE DELAWARE ENCAMPMENT AS IF IT HAD SUDDENLY BURST UPON A BUSY PEOPLE
1502-122619-0007 THE WOMEN RAN FROM LODGE TO LODGE
1502-122619-0008 A FEW EARNESTLY BENT ON SEEKING THE COMFORTS NECESSARY TO THEIR HABITS BUT MORE PAUSING TO EXCHANGE HASTY AND WHISPERED SENTENCES WITH THEIR FRIENDS THE WARRIORS WERE LOUNGING IN GROUPS
1502-122619-0009 THE INSTRUMENTS OF THE CHASE WERE TO BE SEEN IN ABUNDANCE AMONG THE LODGES BUT NONE DEPARTED HERE AND THERE A WARRIOR WAS EXAMINING HIS ARMS WITH AN ATTENTION THAT IS RARELY BESTOWED ON THE IMPLEMENTS
1502-122619-0010 WHEN NO OTHER ENEMY THAN THE BEASTS OF THE FOREST IS EXPECTED TO BE ENCOUNTERED AND OCCASIONALLY THE EYES OF A WHOLE GROUP WERE TURNED SIMULTANEOUSLY
1502-122619-0011 AS IF IT CONTAINED THE SUBJECT OF THEIR COMMON THOUGHTS DURING THE EXISTENCE OF THIS SCENE A MAN SUDDENLY APPEARED AT THE FURTHEST EXTREMITY OF A PLATFORM OF ROCK WHICH FORMED THE LEVEL OF THE VILLAGE
1502-122619-0012 HE WAS WITHOUT ARMS AND HIS PAINT TENDED RATHER TO SOFTEN THAN INCREASE THE NATURAL STERNNESS OF HIS AUSTERE COUNTENANCE WHEN IN FULL VIEW OF THE DELAWARES HE STOPPED AND MADE A GESTURE OF AMITY
1502-122619-0013 BY THROWING HIS ARM UPWARD TOWARD HEAVEN AND THEN LETTING IT FALL IMPRESSIVELY ON HIS BREAST
1502-122619-0014 FORTIFIED BY THESE ASSURANCES THE DARK FIGURE LEFT THE BROW OF THE NATURAL ROCKY TERRACE
1502-122619-0015 HE MADE AS HE ADVANCED MANY COURTEOUS SIGNS OF GREETING TO THE MEN HE PASSED NEGLECTING TO NOTICE THE WOMEN HOWEVER LIKE ONE WHO DEEMED THEIR FAVOR IN THE PRESENT ENTERPRISE OF NO IMPORTANCE
1502-122619-0016 HIS RECEPTION WAS GRAVE SILENT AND WARY THE WARRIORS IN FRONT STEPPED ASIDE OPENING THE WAY TO THEIR MOST APPROVED ORATOR BY THE ACTION
1502-122619-0017 ONE WHO SPOKE ALL THOSE LANGUAGES THAT WERE CULTIVATED AMONG THE NORTHERN ABORIGINES THE WISE HURON IS WELCOME SAID THE DELAWARE
1502-122619-0018 COMPOSED OF CRACKED CORN AND BEANS IT IS MUCH USED ALSO BY THE WHITES BY CORN IS MEANT MAISE
1502-122619-0019 HE IS COME REPEATED MAGUA BENDING HIS HEAD WITH THE DIGNITY OF AN EASTERN PRINCE THE CHIEF EXTENDED HIS ARM AND TAKING THE OTHER BY THE WRIST THEY ONCE MORE EXCHANGED FRIENDLY SALUTATIONS
1502-122619-0020 THEN THE DELAWARE INVITED HIS GUEST TO ENTER HIS OWN LODGE AND SHARE HIS MORNING MEAL THE INVITATION WAS ACCEPTED AND THE TWO WARRIORS ATTENDED BY THREE OR FOUR OF THE OLD MEN WALKED CALMLY AWAY
1502-122619-0021 LEAVING THE REST OF THE TRIBE DEVOURED BY A DESIRE TO UNDERSTAND THE REASONS OF SO UNUSUAL A VISIT AND YET NOT BETRAYING THE LEAST IMPATIENCE BY SIGN OR WORD DURING THE SHORT AND FRUGAL REPAST THAT FOLLOWED
1502-122619-0022 AND RELATED ENTIRELY TO THE EVENTS OF THE HUNT IN WHICH MAGUA HAD SO LATELY BEEN ENGAGED IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE MOST FINISHED BREEDING TO WEAR MORE OF THE APPEARANCE OF CONSIDERING THE VISIT AS A THING OF COURSE THAN DID HIS HOSTS
1502-122619-0023 NOTWITHSTANDING EVERY INDIVIDUAL PRESENT WAS PERFECTLY AWARE
1502-122619-0024 IS THE FACE OF MY GREAT CANADA FATHER TURNED AGAIN TOWARD HIS HURON CHILDREN
1502-122619-0025 WHEN WAS IT EVER OTHERWISE RETURNED MAGUA HE CALLS MY PEOPLE MOST BELOVED THE DELAWARE GRAVELY BOWED HIS ACQUIESCENCE TO WHAT HE KNEW TO BE FALSE AND CONTINUED
1502-122619-0026 THE TOMAHAWKS OF YOUR YOUNG MEN HAVE BEEN VERY RED IT IS SO BUT THEY ARE NOW BRIGHT AND DULL FOR THE YENGEESE ARE DEAD AND THE DELAWARES ARE OUR NEIGHBORS
1502-122619-0027 THE OTHER ACKNOWLEDGED THE PACIFIC COMPLIMENT BY A GESTURE OF THE HAND AND REMAINED SILENT THEN MAGUA AS IF RECALLED TO SUCH A RECOLLECTION BY THE ALLUSION TO THE MASSACRE DEMANDED
1502-122619-0028 DOES MY PRISONER GIVE TROUBLE TO MY BROTHERS SHE IS WELCOME THE PATH BETWEEN THE HURONS AND THE DELAWARES IS SHORT AND IT IS OPEN LET HER BE SENT TO MY SQUAWS IF SHE GIVES TROUBLE TO MY BROTHER
1502-122619-0029 SHE IS WELCOME RETURNED THE CHIEF OF THE LATTER NATION STILL MORE EMPHATICALLY THE BAFFLED MAGUA CONTINUED SILENT SEVERAL MINUTES APPARENTLY INDIFFERENT HOWEVER TO THE REPULSE HE HAD RECEIVED
1502-122619-0030 IN THIS HIS OPENING EFFORT TO REGAIN POSSESSION OF CORA DO MY YOUNG MEN LEAVE THE DELAWARES ROOM ON THE MOUNTAINS FOR THEIR HUNTS HE AT LENGTH CONTINUED
1502-122619-0031 IT IS WELL JUSTICE IS THE MASTER OF A RED SKIN WHY SHOULD THEY BRIGHTEN THEIR TOMAHAWKS AND SHARPEN THEIR KNIVES AGAINST EACH OTHER ARE NOT THE PALE FACES THICKER THAN THE SWALLOWS IN THE SEASON OF FLOWERS
1502-122619-0032 GOOD EXCLAIMED TWO OR THREE OF HIS AUDITORS AT THE SAME TIME
1502-122619-0033 TO PERMIT HIS WORDS TO SOFTEN THE FEELINGS OF THE DELAWARES BEFORE HE ADDED HAVE THERE NOT BEEN STRANGE MOCCASINS IN THE WOODS HAVE NOT MY BROTHERS SCENTED THE FEET OF WHITE MEN
1502-122619-0034 LET MY CANADA FATHER COME RETURNED THE OTHER EVASIVELY HIS CHILDREN ARE READY TO SEE HIM WHEN THE GREAT CHIEF COMES IT IS TO SMOKE WITH THE INDIANS IN THEIR WIGWAMS THE HURONS SAY TOO HE IS WELCOME
1502-122619-0035 BUT THE YENGEESE HAVE LONG ARMS AND LEGS THAT NEVER TIRE
1502-122619-0036 IT IS WELL THE WARRIOR WHOSE EYE IS OPEN CAN SEE HIS ENEMY SAID MAGUA ONCE MORE SHIFTING HIS GROUND
1502-122619-0037 AND GRAVELY SPREAD HIS PRESENTS BEFORE THE DAZZLED EYES OF HIS HOSTS THEY CONSISTED PRINCIPALLY OF TRINKETS OF LITTLE VALUE PLUNDERED FROM THE SLAUGHTERED FEMALES OF WILLIAM HENRY
1502-122619-0038 IN THE DIVISION OF THE BAUBLES THE CUNNING HURON DISCOVERED NO LESS ART THAN IN THEIR SELECTION WHILE HE BESTOWED THOSE OF GREATER VALUE ON THE TWO MOST DISTINGUISHED WARRIORS ONE OF WHOM WAS HIS HOST HE SEASONED HIS OFFERINGS TO THEIR INFERIORS
1502-122619-0039 COMPLIMENTS AS LEFT THEM NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT IN SHORT THE WHOLE CEREMONY CONTAINED SUCH A HAPPY BLENDING OF THE PROFITABLE WITH THE FLATTERING THAT IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT FOR THE DONOR IMMEDIATELY TO READ THE EFFECT OF A GENEROSITY
1502-122619-0040 SO APTLY MINGLED WITH PRAISE IN THE EYES OF THOSE HE ADDRESSED THIS WELL JUDGED AND POLITIC STROKE ON THE PART OF MAGUA WAS NOT WITHOUT INSTANTANEOUS RESULTS
1502-122619-0041 MY BROTHER IS A WISE CHIEF HE IS WELCOME THE HURONS LOVE THEIR FRIENDS THE DELAWARES RETURNED MAGUA WHY SHOULD THEY NOT THEY ARE COLORED BY THE SAME SUN AND THEIR JUST MEN WILL HUNT IN THE SAME GROUNDS AFTER DEATH
1502-122619-0042 THE RED SKINS SHOULD BE FRIENDS AND LOOK WITH OPEN EYES ON THE WHITE MEN HAS NOT MY BROTHER SCENTED SPIES IN THE WOODS THE DELAWARE WHOSE NAME IN ENGLISH SIGNIFIED HARD HEART
1502-122619-0043 AN APPELLATION THAT THE FRENCH HAD TRANSLATED INTO LE COEUR DUR FORGOT THAT OBDURACY OF PURPOSE
1502-122619-0044 WOULD THE YENGEESE SEND THEIR WOMEN AS SPIES DID NOT THE HURON CHIEF SAY HE TOOK WOMEN IN THE BATTLE HE TOLD NO LIE THE YENGEESE HAVE SENT OUT THEIR SCOUTS
1502-122619-0045 THEN THEY FLED TO THE DELAWARES FOR SAY THEY THE DELAWARES ARE OUR FRIENDS THEIR MINDS ARE TURNED FROM THEIR CANADA FATHER THIS INSINUATION WAS A HOME THRUST
1502-122619-0046 WOULD HAVE ENTITLED MAGUA TO THE REPUTATION OF A SKILLFUL DIPLOMATIST THE RECENT DEFECTION OF THE TRIBE HAD AS THEY WELL KNEW THEMSELVES SUBJECTED THE DELAWARES TO MUCH REPROACH AMONG THEIR FRENCH ALLIES
1502-122619-0047 AND THEY WERE NOW MADE TO FEEL THAT THEIR FUTURE ACTIONS WERE TO BE REGARDED WITH JEALOUSY AND DISTRUST THERE WAS NO DEEP INSIGHT INTO CAUSES AND EFFECTS NECESSARY TO FORESEE
1502-122619-0048 THAT SUCH A SITUATION OF THINGS WAS LIKELY TO PROVE HIGHLY PREJUDICIAL TO THEIR FUTURE MOVEMENTS THEIR DISTANT VILLAGES THEIR HUNTING GROUNDS
1502-122619-0049 TOGETHER WITH A MATERIAL PART OF THEIR PHYSICAL FORCE WERE ACTUALLY WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FRENCH TERRITORY ACCORDINGLY THIS ALARMING ANNUNCIATION WAS RECEIVED AS MAGUA INTENDED
1502-122619-0050 WITH MANIFEST DISAPPROBATION IF NOT WITH ALARM
1502-122619-0051 HE WILL SEE NO CHANGE IT IS TRUE MY YOUNG MEN DID NOT GO OUT ON THE WAR PATH THEY HAD DREAMS FOR NOT DOING SO BUT THEY LOVE AND VENERATE THE GREAT WHITE CHIEF
1502-122619-0052 WILL HE THINK SO WHEN HE HEARS THAT HIS GREATEST ENEMY IS FED IN THE CAMP OF HIS CHILDREN
1502-122619-0053 THAT THE PALE FACE WHO HAS SLAIN SO MANY OF HIS FRIENDS GOES IN AND OUT AMONG THE DELAWARES GO MY GREAT CANADA FATHER IS NOT A FOOL
1502-122619-0054 LA LONGUE CARABINE THE DELAWARE WARRIORS STARTED AT THE WELL KNOWN NAME BETRAYING BY THEIR AMAZEMENT THAT THEY NOW LEARNED FOR THE FIRST TIME ONE SO FAMOUS AMONG THE INDIAN ALLIES OF FRANCE WAS WITHIN THEIR POWER
1502-122619-0055 WHAT DOES MY BROTHER MEAN DEMANDED LE COEUR DUR IN A TONE THAT BY ITS WONDER FAR EXCEEDED THE USUAL APATHY OF HIS RACE A HURON NEVER LIES RETURNED MAGUA COLDLY
1502-122619-0056 A LONG AND MUSING PAUSE SUCCEEDED THE CHIEF CONSULTED APART WITH HIS COMPANIONS AND MESSENGERS DESPATCHED TO COLLECT CERTAIN OTHERS OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED MEN OF THE TRIBE AS WARRIOR AFTER WARRIOR DROPPED IN
1502-122619-0057 THE NEWS SPREAD FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH UNTIL THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT BECAME POWERFULLY AGITATED THE WOMEN SUSPENDED THEIR LABORS TO CATCH SUCH SYLLABLES AS UNGUARDEDLY FELL FROM THE LIPS OF THE CONSULTING WARRIORS
1502-122619-0058 THE BOYS DESERTED THEIR SPORTS AND WALKING FEARLESSLY AMONG THEIR FATHERS LOOKED UP IN CURIOUS ADMIRATION AS THEY HEARD THE BRIEF EXCLAMATIONS OF WONDER THEY SO FREELY EXPRESSED THE TEMERITY OF THEIR HATED FOE
1502-122619-0059 IN SHORT EVERY OCCUPATION WAS ABANDONED FOR THE TIME AND ALL OTHER PURSUITS SEEMED DISCARDED IN ORDER THAT THE TRIBE MIGHT FREELY INDULGE AFTER THEIR OWN PECULIAR MANNER IN AN OPEN EXPRESSION OF FEELING
1502-122619-0060 THE OLD MEN DISPOSED THEMSELVES SERIOUSLY TO CONSIDER THAT WHICH IT BECAME THE HONOR AND SAFETY OF THEIR TRIBE TO PERFORM UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES OF SO MUCH DELICACY AND EMBARRASSMENT
1502-122619-0061 MAGUA HAD NOT ONLY MAINTAINED HIS SEAT BUT THE VERY ATTITUDE HE HAD ORIGINALLY TAKEN AGAINST THE SIDE OF THE LODGE
1502-122619-0062 AND APPARENTLY AS UNCONCERNED AS IF HE HAD NO INTEREST IN THE RESULT
1502-122619-0063 ESCAPED HIS VIGILANT EYES
1502-122619-0064 HE ANTICIPATED EVERY MEASURE ON WHICH THEY DECIDED AND IT MIGHT ALMOST BE SAID
1502-122619-0065 AND FORMAL ASSEMBLAGE OF THE NATION AS SUCH MEETINGS WERE RARE AND ONLY CALLED ON OCCASIONS OF THE LAST IMPORTANCE THE SUBTLE HURON WHO STILL SAT APART
1502-122619-0066 NOW KNEW THAT ALL HIS PROJECTS MUST BE BROUGHT TO THEIR FINAL ISSUE
1502-122619-0067 IN FRONT OF THE ENCAMPMENT WHITHER THE WARRIORS WERE ALREADY BEGINNING TO COLLECT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE EACH INDIVIDUAL INCLUDING EVEN THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN WAS IN HIS PLACE
1502-122619-0068 THE DELAY HAD BEEN CREATED BY THE GRAVE PREPARATIONS THAT WERE DEEMED NECESSARY TO SO SOLEMN AND UNUSUAL A CONFERENCE BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS SEEN CLIMBING ABOVE THE TOPS OF THAT MOUNTAIN
1502-122619-0069 ITS NUMBER SOMEWHAT EXCEEDED A THOUSAND SOULS
1502-122619-0070 STANDING READY TO MOVE HIS AUDITORS TO SOME HASTY AND PERHAPS INJUDICIOUS DISCUSSION
1502-122619-0071 UNTIL SUCH A ONE CHOSE TO MAKE SOME MOVEMENT NO DEEDS IN ARMS NO NATURAL GIFTS NOR ANY RENOWN AS AN ORATOR
1502-122619-0072 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION THE AGED WARRIOR WHOSE PRIVILEGE IT WAS TO SPEAK WAS SILENT SEEMINGLY OPPRESSED WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF HIS SUBJECT THE DELAY HAD ALREADY CONTINUED LONG BEYOND THE USUAL DELIBERATIVE PAUSE
1502-122619-0073 THAT ALWAYS PRECEDED A CONFERENCE BUT NO SIGN OF IMPATIENCE OR SURPRISE ESCAPED EVEN THE YOUNGEST BOY OCCASIONALLY AN EYE WAS RAISED FROM THE EARTH WHERE THE LOOKS OF MOST WERE RIVETED
1502-122619-0074 AND THREE MEN ISSUING FROM IT SLOWLY APPROACHED THE PLACE OF CONSULTATION THEY WERE ALL AGED EVEN BEYOND THAT PERIOD TO WHICH THE OLDEST PRESENT HAD REACHED BUT ONE IN THE CENTER WHO LEANED ON HIS COMPANIONS FOR SUPPORT
1502-122619-0075 HAD NUMBERED AN AMOUNT OF YEARS TO WHICH THE HUMAN RACE IS SELDOM PERMITTED TO ATTAIN HIS FRAME WHICH HAD ONCE BEEN TALL AND ERECT LIKE THE CEDAR WAS NOW BENDING UNDER THE PRESSURE OF MORE THAN A CENTURY
1502-122619-0076 THE ELASTIC LIGHT STEP OF AN INDIAN WAS GONE AND IN ITS PLACE HE WAS COMPELLED TO TOIL HIS TARDY WAY OVER THE GROUND
1502-122619-0077 HIS DARK WRINKLED COUNTENANCE WAS IN SINGULAR AND WILD CONTRAST WITH THE LONG WHITE LOCKS WHICH FLOATED ON HIS SHOULDERS
1502-122619-0078 SINCE THEY HAD LAST BEEN SHORN THE DRESS OF THIS PATRIARCH FOR SUCH CONSIDERING HIS VAST AGE IN CONJUNCTION WITH HIS AFFINITY AND INFLUENCE WITH HIS PEOPLE HE MIGHT VERY PROPERLY BE TERMED
1502-122619-0079 WAS RICH AND IMPOSING THOUGH STRICTLY AFTER THE SIMPLE FASHIONS OF THE TRIBE HIS ROBE WAS OF THE FINEST SKINS WHICH HAD BEEN DEPRIVED OF THEIR FUR
1502-122619-0080 OF VARIOUS DEEDS IN ARMS DONE IN FORMER AGES HIS BOSOM WAS LOADED WITH MEDALS SOME IN MASSIVE SILVER AND ONE OR TWO EVEN IN GOLD
1502-122619-0081 HE ALSO WORE ARMLETS AND CINCTURES ABOVE THE ANKLES OF THE LATTER PRECIOUS METAL
1502-122619-0082 IN TOUCHING CONTRAST TO THE COLOR OF HIS SNOW WHITE LOCKS HIS TOMAHAWK WAS NEARLY HID IN SILVER AND THE HANDLE OF HIS KNIFE SHONE LIKE A HORN OF SOLID GOLD SO SOON AS THE FIRST HUM OF EMOTION AND PLEASURE
1502-122619-0083 WHICH THE SUDDEN APPEARANCE OF THIS VENERATED INDIVIDUAL CREATED HAD A LITTLE SUBSIDED
1502-122619-0084 WAS WHISPERED FROM MOUTH TO MOUTH MAGUA HAD OFTEN HEARD THE FAME OF THIS WISE AND JUST DELAWARE
1502-122619-0085 WITH THE GREAT SPIRIT AND WHICH HAS SINCE TRANSMITTED HIS NAME WITH SOME SLIGHT ALTERATION TO THE WHITE USURPERS OF HIS ANCIENT TERRITORY
1502-122619-0086 THE HURON CHIEF THEREFORE STEPPED EAGERLY OUT A LITTLE FROM THE THRONG
1502-122619-0087 WHOSE DECISION WAS LIKELY TO PRODUCE SO DEEP AN INFLUENCE ON HIS OWN FORTUNES
1502-122619-0088 THE AMERICANS SOMETIMES CALLED THEIR TUTELAR SAINT TAMENAY A CORRUPTION OF THE NAME OF THE RENOWNED CHIEF HERE INTRODUCED
1502-122619-0089 THE EYES OF THE OLD MAN WERE CLOSED AS THOUGH THE ORGANS WERE WEARIED WITH HAVING SO LONG WITNESSED THE SELFISH WORKINGS OF THE HUMAN PASSIONS
1502-122619-0090 WITH THE DIGNITY OF A MONARCH AND THE AIR OF A FATHER
1502-122619-0091 WHO BELONGS RATHER TO ANOTHER WORLD THAN TO THIS WAS RECEIVED BY HIS PEOPLE AFTER A SUITABLE AND DECENT PAUSE
1502-122619-0092 AND APPROACHING THE PATRIARCH THEY PLACED HIS HANDS REVERENTLY ON THEIR HEADS SEEMING TO ENTREAT A BLESSING THE YOUNGER MEN WERE CONTENT WITH TOUCHING HIS ROBE OR EVEN DRAWING NIGH HIS PERSON
1502-122619-0093 SO JUST AND SO VALIANT NONE BUT THE MOST DISTINGUISHED AMONG THE YOUTHFUL WARRIORS EVEN PRESUMED SO FAR AS TO PERFORM THE LATTER CEREMONY THE GREAT MASS OF THE MULTITUDE DEEMING IT A SUFFICIENT HAPPINESS
1502-122619-0094 THE CHIEFS DREW BACK AGAIN TO THEIR SEVERAL PLACES AND SILENCE REIGNED IN THE WHOLE ENCAMPMENT
1502-122619-0095 AROSE LEFT THE CROWD AND ENTERED THE LODGE WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN NOTED AS THE OBJECT OF SO MUCH ATTENTION THROUGHOUT THAT MORNING
1502-122619-0096 ESCORTING THE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD CAUSED ALL THESE SOLEMN PREPARATIONS TOWARD THE SEAT OF JUDGMENT THE CROWD OPENED IN A LANE AND WHEN THE PARTY HAD RE ENTERED
1553-140047-0000 SNOW WHITE ROSE RED JUST BEFORE THANKSGIVING THE AFFAIRS OF THE SIMPSONS REACHED WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CALLED A CRISIS EVEN IN THEIR FAMILY
1553-140047-0001 WHICH HAD BEEN BORN AND REARED IN A STATE OF ADVENTUROUS POVERTY AND PERILOUS UNCERTAINTY RIVERBORO WAS DOING ITS BEST TO RETURN THE ENTIRE TRIBE OF SIMPSONS TO THE LAND OF ITS FATHERS SO TO SPEAK
1553-140047-0002 THINKING RIGHTLY THAT THE TOWN WHICH HAD GIVEN THEM BIRTH RATHER THAN THE TOWN OF THEIR ADOPTION SHOULD FEED THEM AND KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEADS UNTIL THE CHILDREN WERE OF AN AGE FOR SELF SUPPORT THERE WAS LITTLE TO EAT IN THE HOUSEHOLD
1553-140047-0003 AND LESS TO WEAR THOUGH MISSUS SIMPSON DID AS ALWAYS HER POOR BEST THE CHILDREN MANAGED TO SATISFY THEIR APPETITES BY SITTING MODESTLY OUTSIDE THEIR NEIGHBORS KITCHEN DOORS WHEN MEALS WERE ABOUT TO BE SERVED
1553-140047-0004 THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY POPULAR FAVORITES BUT THEY DID RECEIVE CERTAIN UNDESIRABLE MORSELS FROM THE MORE CHARITABLE HOUSEWIVES LIFE WAS RATHER DULL AND DREARY HOWEVER AND IN THE CHILL AND GLOOM OF NOVEMBER WEATHER
1553-140047-0005 WITH THE VISION OF OTHER PEOPLE'S TURKEYS BURSTING WITH FAT AND OTHER PEOPLE'S GOLDEN PUMPKINS AND SQUASHES AND CORN BEING GARNERED INTO BARNS THE YOUNG SIMPSONS GROPED ABOUT FOR SOME INEXPENSIVE FORM OF EXCITEMENT
1553-140047-0006 AND SETTLED UPON THE SELLING OF SOAP FOR A PREMIUM THEY HAD SOLD ENOUGH TO THEIR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBORS DURING THE EARLIER AUTUMN TO SECURE A CHILD'S HANDCART WHICH THOUGH VERY WEAK ON ITS PINS COULD BE TRUNDLED OVER THE COUNTRY ROADS
1553-140047-0007 WITH LARGE BUSINESS SAGACITY AND AN EXECUTIVE CAPACITY WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN INHERITED FROM THEIR FATHER THEY NOW PROPOSED TO EXTEND THEIR OPERATIONS TO A LARGER AREA AND DISTRIBUTE SOAP TO CONTIGUOUS VILLAGES
1553-140047-0008 IF THESE VILLAGES COULD BE INDUCED TO BUY THE EXCELSIOR SOAP COMPANY PAID A VERY SMALL RETURN OF ANY KIND TO ITS INFANTILE AGENTS WHO WERE SCATTERED THROUGH THE STATE BUT IT INFLAMED THEIR IMAGINATIONS BY THE ISSUE OF CIRCULARS
1553-140047-0009 WITH HIGHLY COLORED PICTURES OF THE PREMIUMS TO BE AWARDED FOR THE SALE OF A CERTAIN NUMBER OF CAKES IT WAS AT THIS JUNCTURE THAT CLARA BELLE AND SUSAN SIMPSON CONSULTED REBECCA WHO THREW HERSELF SOLIDLY AND WHOLEHEARTEDLY INTO THE ENTERPRISE
1553-140047-0010 PROMISING HER HELP AND THAT OF EMMA JANE PERKINS THE PREMIUMS WITHIN THEIR POSSIBLE GRASP WERE THREE A BOOKCASE A PLUSH RECLINING CHAIR AND A BANQUET LAMP OF COURSE THE SIMPSONS HAD NO BOOKS
1553-140047-0011 AND CASTING ASIDE WITHOUT THOUGHT OR PANG THE PLUSH CHAIR
1553-140047-0012 NOT COUNTING MISTER SIMPSON WHO ORDINARILY SAT ELSEWHERE AT THE TOWN'S EXPENSE THEY WARMED THEMSELVES RAPTUROUSLY IN THE VISION OF THE BANQUET LAMP WHICH SPEEDILY BECAME TO THEM MORE DESIRABLE THAN FOOD DRINK OR CLOTHING
1553-140047-0013 NEITHER EMMA JANE NOR REBECCA PERCEIVED ANYTHING INCONGRUOUS IN THE IDEA OF THE SIMPSONS STRIVING FOR A BANQUET LAMP THEY LOOKED AT THE PICTURE DAILY AND KNEW THAT IF THEY THEMSELVES WERE FREE AGENTS THEY WOULD TOIL SUFFER
1553-140047-0014 AY SWEAT FOR THE HAPPY PRIVILEGE OF OCCUPYING THE SAME ROOM WITH THAT LAMP THROUGH THE COMING WINTER EVENINGS IT LOOKED TO BE ABOUT EIGHT FEET TALL IN THE CATALOGUE AND EMMA JANE ADVISED CLARA BELLE TO MEASURE THE HEIGHT OF THE SIMPSON CEILINGS
1553-140047-0015 BUT A NOTE IN THE MARGIN OF THE CIRCULAR INFORMED THEM THAT IT STOOD TWO AND A HALF FEET HIGH WHEN SET UP IN ALL ITS DIGNITY AND SPLENDOR ON A PROPER TABLE THREE DOLLARS EXTRA IT WAS ONLY OF POLISHED BRASS CONTINUED THE CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0016 THOUGH IT WAS INVARIABLY MISTAKEN FOR SOLID GOLD AND THE SHADE THAT ACCOMPANIED IT AT LEAST IT ACCOMPANIED IT IF THE AGENT SOLD A HUNDRED EXTRA CAKES WAS OF CRINKLED CREPE PAPER PRINTED IN A DOZEN DELICIOUS HUES
1553-140047-0017 FROM WHICH THE JOY DAZZLED AGENT MIGHT TAKE HIS CHOICE SEESAW SIMPSON WAS NOT IN THE SYNDICATE CLARA BELLE WAS RATHER A SUCCESSFUL AGENT BUT SUSAN WHO COULD ONLY SAY THOAP NEVER MADE LARGE RETURNS
1553-140047-0018 AND THE TWINS WHO WERE SOMEWHAT YOUNG TO BE THOROUGHLY TRUSTWORTHY COULD BE GIVEN ONLY A HALF DOZEN CAKES AT A TIME AND WERE OBLIGED TO CARRY WITH THEM ON THEIR BUSINESS TRIPS A BRIEF DOCUMENT STATING THE PRICE PER CAKE DOZEN AND BOX
1553-140047-0019 REBECCA AND EMMA JANE OFFERED TO GO TWO OR THREE MILES IN SOME ONE DIRECTION AND SEE WHAT THEY COULD DO IN THE WAY OF STIRRING UP A POPULAR DEMAND FOR THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED BRANDS THE FORMER BEING DEVOTED TO LAUNDRY PURPOSES
1553-140047-0020 AND THE LATTER BEING INTENDED FOR THE TOILET THERE WAS A GREAT AMOUNT OF HILARITY IN THE PREPARATION FOR THIS EVENT AND A LONG COUNCIL IN EMMA JANE'S ATTIC THEY HAD THE SOAP COMPANY'S CIRCULAR FROM WHICH TO ARRANGE A PROPER SPEECH
1553-140047-0021 AND THEY HAD WHAT WAS STILL BETTER THE REMEMBRANCE OF A CERTAIN PATENT MEDICINE VENDER'S DISCOURSE AT THE MILLTOWN FAIR HIS METHOD WHEN ONCE OBSERVED COULD NEVER BE FORGOTTEN NOR HIS MANNER NOR HIS VOCABULARY
1553-140047-0022 EMMA JANE PRACTICED IT ON REBECCA AND REBECCA ON EMMA JANE CAN I SELL YOU A LITTLE SOAP THIS AFTERNOON IT IS CALLED THE SNOW WHITE AND ROSE RED SOAP
1553-140047-0023 SIX CAKES IN AN ORNAMENTAL BOX ONLY TWENTY CENTS FOR THE WHITE TWENTY FIVE CENTS FOR THE RED IT IS MADE FROM THE PUREST INGREDIENTS AND IF DESIRED COULD BE EATEN BY AN INVALID WITH RELISH AND PROFIT
1553-140047-0024 OH REBECCA DON'T LET'S SAY THAT INTERPOSED EMMA JANE HYSTERICALLY IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A FOOL IT TAKES SO LITTLE TO MAKE YOU FEEL LIKE A FOOL EMMA JANE REBUKED REBECCA THAT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT YOU MUST BE ONE
1553-140047-0025 I DON'T GET TO FEELING LIKE A FOOL SO AWFULLY EASY NOW LEAVE OUT THAT EATING PART IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT AND GO ON THE SNOW WHITE IS PROBABLY THE MOST REMARKABLE LAUNDRY SOAP EVER MANUFACTURED
1553-140047-0026 IMMERSE THE GARMENTS IN A TUB LIGHTLY RUBBING THE MORE SOILED PORTIONS WITH THE SOAP LEAVE THEM SUBMERGED IN WATER FROM SUNSET TO SUNRISE AND THEN THE YOUNGEST BABY CAN WASH THEM WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST EFFORT
1553-140047-0027 BABE NOT BABY CORRECTED REBECCA FROM THE CIRCULAR IT'S JUST THE SAME THING ARGUED EMMA JANE OF COURSE IT'S JUST THE SAME THING BUT A BABY HAS GOT TO BE CALLED BABE OR INFANT IN A CIRCULAR
1553-140047-0028 THE SAME AS IT IS IN POETRY WOULD YOU RATHER SAY INFANT NO GRUMBLED EMMA JANE INFANT IS WORSE EVEN THAN BABE
1553-140047-0029 AND LET ELIJAH OR ELISHA TRY THE SOAP BEFORE WE BEGIN SELLING I CAN'T IMAGINE A BABE DOING A FAMILY WASH WITH ANY SOAP ANSWERED REBECCA BUT IT MUST BE TRUE OR THEY WOULD NEVER DARE TO PRINT IT SO DON'T LET'S BOTHER
1553-140047-0030 OH WON'T IT BE THE GREATEST FUN EMMA JANE AT SOME OF THE HOUSES WHERE THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KNOW ME I SHAN'T BE FRIGHTENED AND I SHALL REEL OFF THE WHOLE RIGMAROLE INVALID BABE AND ALL
1553-140047-0031 PERHAPS I SHALL SAY EVEN THE LAST SENTENCE IF I CAN REMEMBER IT WE SOUND EVERY CHORD IN THE GREAT MAC RO COSM OF SATISFACTION
1553-140047-0032 THIS CONVERSATION TOOK PLACE ON A FRIDAY AFTERNOON AT EMMA JANE'S HOUSE WHERE REBECCA TO HER UNBOUNDED JOY WAS TO STAY OVER SUNDAY HER AUNTS HAVING GONE TO PORTLAND TO THE FUNERAL OF AN OLD FRIEND
1553-140047-0033 SATURDAY BEING A HOLIDAY THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THE OLD WHITE HORSE DRIVE TO NORTH RIVERBORO THREE MILES AWAY EAT A TWELVE O'CLOCK DINNER WITH EMMA JANE'S COUSINS AND BE BACK AT FOUR O'CLOCK PUNCTUALLY
1553-140047-0034 WHEN THE CHILDREN ASKED MISSUS PERKINS IF THEY COULD CALL AT JUST A FEW HOUSES COMING AND GOING AND SELL A LITTLE SOAP FOR THE SIMPSONS SHE AT FIRST REPLIED DECIDEDLY IN THE NEGATIVE
1553-140047-0035 SHE WAS AN INDULGENT PARENT HOWEVER AND REALLY HAD LITTLE OBJECTION TO EMMA JANE AMUSING HERSELF IN THIS UNUSUAL WAY IT WAS ONLY FOR REBECCA AS THE NIECE OF THE DIFFICULT MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE RAISED SCRUPLES
1553-140047-0036 BUT WHEN FULLY PERSUADED THAT THE ENTERPRISE WAS A CHARITABLE ONE SHE ACQUIESCED THE GIRLS CALLED AT MISTER WATSON'S STORE AND ARRANGED FOR SEVERAL LARGE BOXES OF SOAP TO BE CHARGED TO CLARA BELLE SIMPSON'S ACCOUNT
1553-140047-0037 THESE WERE LIFTED INTO THE BACK OF THE WAGON AND A HAPPIER COUPLE NEVER DROVE ALONG THE COUNTRY ROAD THAN REBECCA AND HER COMPANION IT WAS A GLORIOUS INDIAN SUMMER DAY WHICH SUGGESTED NOTHING OF THANKSGIVING NEAR AT HAND AS IT WAS
1553-140047-0038 IT WAS A RUSTLY DAY A SCARLET AND BUFF YELLOW AND CARMINE BRONZE AND CRIMSON DAY THERE WERE STILL MANY LEAVES ON THE OAKS AND MAPLES MAKING A GOODLY SHOW OF RED AND BROWN AND GOLD
1553-140047-0039 THE AIR WAS LIKE SPARKLING CIDER AND EVERY FIELD HAD ITS HEAPS OF YELLOW AND RUSSET GOOD THINGS TO EAT ALL READY FOR THE BARNS THE MILLS AND THE MARKETS THE HORSE FORGOT HIS TWENTY YEARS
1553-140047-0040 SNIFFED THE SWEET BRIGHT AIR AND TROTTED LIKE A COLT NOKOMIS MOUNTAIN LOOKED BLUE AND CLEAR IN THE DISTANCE REBECCA STOOD IN THE WAGON AND APOSTROPHIZED THE LANDSCAPE WITH SUDDEN JOY OF LIVING
1553-140047-0041 GREAT WIDE BEAUTIFUL WONDERFUL WORLD WITH THE WONDERFUL WATER ROUND YOU CURLED AND THE WONDERFUL GRASS UPON YOUR BREAST WORLD YOU ARE BEAUTIFULLY DREST
1553-140047-0042 DULL EMMA JANE HAD NEVER SEEMED TO REBECCA SO NEAR SO DEAR SO TRIED AND TRUE AND REBECCA TO EMMA JANE'S FAITHFUL HEART HAD NEVER BEEN SO BRILLIANT SO BEWILDERING SO FASCINATING AS IN THIS VISIT TOGETHER
1553-140047-0043 WITH ITS INTIMACY ITS FREEDOM AND THE ADDED DELIGHTS OF AN EXCITING BUSINESS ENTERPRISE A GORGEOUS LEAF BLEW INTO THE WAGON DOES COLOR MAKE YOU SORT OF DIZZY ASKED REBECCA
1553-140047-0044 NO IT DON'T NOT A MITE PERHAPS DIZZY ISN'T JUST THE RIGHT WORD BUT IT'S NEAREST I'D LIKE TO EAT COLOR AND DRINK IT AND SLEEP IN IT IF YOU COULD BE A TREE WHICH ONE WOULD YOU CHOOSE
1553-140047-0045 EMMA JANE HAD ENJOYED CONSIDERABLE EXPERIENCE OF THIS KIND AND REBECCA HAD SUCCEEDED IN UNSTOPPING HER EARS UNGLUING HER EYES AND LOOSENING HER TONGUE SO THAT SHE COULD PLAY THE GAME AFTER A FASHION
1553-140047-0046 I'D RATHER BE AN APPLE TREE IN BLOSSOM THAT ONE THAT BLOOMS PINK BY OUR PIG PEN REBECCA LAUGHED THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING UNEXPECTED IN EMMA JANE'S REPLIES
1553-140047-0047 I'D CHOOSE TO BE THAT SCARLET MAPLE JUST ON THE EDGE OF THE POND THERE AND SHE POINTED WITH THE WHIP THEN I COULD SEE SO MUCH MORE THAN YOUR PINK APPLE TREE BY THE PIG PEN I COULD LOOK AT ALL THE REST OF THE WOODS
1553-140047-0048 SEE MY SCARLET DRESS IN MY BEAUTIFUL LOOKING GLASS AND WATCH ALL THE YELLOW AND BROWN TREES GROWING UPSIDE DOWN IN THE WATER WHEN I'M OLD ENOUGH TO EARN MONEY I'M GOING TO HAVE A DRESS LIKE THIS LEAF
1553-140047-0049 THEN I THINK I'LL HAVE A BROWN SASH LIKE THE TRUNK OF THE TREE AND WHERE COULD I BE GREEN DO THEY HAVE GREEN PETTICOATS I WONDER I'D LIKE A GREEN PETTICOAT COMING OUT NOW AND THEN UNDERNEATH
1553-140047-0050 TO SHOW WHAT MY LEAVES WERE LIKE BEFORE I WAS A SCARLET MAPLE I THINK IT WOULD BE AWFUL HOMELY SAID EMMA JANE
1553-140047-0051 WITH A PINK SASH PINK STOCKINGS BRONZE SLIPPERS
1553-140048-0000 THEY DID NOT ACCOMPANY EACH OTHER TO THE DOORS OF THEIR CHOSEN VICTIMS FEELING SURE THAT TOGETHER THEY COULD NOT APPROACH THE SUBJECT SERIOUSLY BUT THEY PARTED AT THE GATE OF EACH HOUSE THE ONE HOLDING THE HORSE WHILE THE OTHER TOOK THE SOAP SAMPLES
1553-140048-0001 AND INTERVIEWED ANY ONE WHO SEEMED OF A COMING ON DISPOSITION EMMA JANE HAD DISPOSED OF THREE SINGLE CAKES REBECCA OF THREE SMALL BOXES FOR A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR ABILITY TO PERSUADE THE PUBLIC WAS CLEARLY DEFINED AT THE START
1553-140048-0002 THOUGH NEITHER OF THEM ASCRIBED EITHER SUCCESS OR DEFEAT TO ANYTHING BUT THE IMPERIOUS FORCE OF CIRCUMSTANCES HOUSEWIVES LOOKED AT EMMA JANE AND DESIRED NO SOAP LISTENED TO HER DESCRIPTION OF ITS MERITS AND STILL DESIRED NONE
1553-140048-0003 OTHER STARS IN THEIR COURSES GOVERNED REBECCA'S DOINGS THE PEOPLE WHOM SHE INTERVIEWED EITHER REMEMBERED THEIR PRESENT NEED OF SOAP OR REMINDED THEMSELVES THAT THEY WOULD NEED IT IN THE FUTURE THE NOTABLE POINT IN THE CASE BEING
1553-140048-0004 THAT LUCKY REBECCA ACCOMPLISHED WITH ALMOST NO EFFORT RESULTS THAT POOR LITTLE EMMA JANE FAILED TO ATTAIN BY HARD AND CONSCIENTIOUS LABOR IT'S YOUR TURN REBECCA AND I'M GLAD TOO SAID EMMA JANE
1553-140048-0005 DRAWING UP TO A GATEWAY AND INDICATING A HOUSE THAT WAS SET A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE ROAD I HAVEN'T GOT OVER TREMBLING FROM THE LAST PLACE YET A LADY HAD PUT HER HEAD OUT OF AN UPSTAIRS WINDOW AND CALLED
1553-140048-0006 GO AWAY LITTLE GIRL WHATEVER YOU HAVE IN YOUR BOX WE DON'T WANT ANY I DON'T KNOW WHO LIVES HERE AND THE BLINDS ARE ALL SHUT IN FRONT IF THERE'S NOBODY AT HOME YOU MUSTN'T COUNT IT BUT TAKE THE NEXT HOUSE AS YOURS
1553-140048-0007 REBECCA WALKED UP THE LANE AND WENT TO THE SIDE DOOR THERE WAS A PORCH THERE AND SEATED IN A ROCKING CHAIR HUSKING CORN WAS A GOOD LOOKING YOUNG MAN OR WAS HE MIDDLE AGED REBECCA COULD NOT MAKE UP HER MIND
1553-140048-0008 AT ALL EVENTS HE HAD AN AIR OF THE CITY ABOUT HIM WELL SHAVEN FACE WELL TRIMMED MUSTACHE WELL FITTING CLOTHES REBECCA WAS A TRIFLE SHY AT THIS UNEXPECTED ENCOUNTER BUT THERE WAS NOTHING TO BE DONE BUT EXPLAIN HER PRESENCE

1553-140048-0013 WISE CHILD THIS WAS GREAT GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND A CUSTOMER WHO KNEW ALL THE VIRTUES OF THE ARTICLE IN ADVANCE REBECCA DIMPLED MORE AND MORE AND AT HER NEW FRIEND'S INVITATION SAT DOWN ON A STOOL AT HIS SIDE NEAR THE EDGE OF THE PORCH
1553-140048-0014 AND THE PRICES OF BOTH THAT AND THE SNOW WHITE WERE UNFOLDED PRESENTLY SHE FORGOT ALL ABOUT HER SILENT PARTNER AT THE GATE AND WAS TALKING AS IF SHE HAD KNOWN THIS GRAND PERSONAGE ALL HER LIFE
1553-140048-0015 I'M KEEPING HOUSE TO DAY BUT I DON'T LIVE HERE EXPLAINED THE DELIGHTFUL GENTLEMAN I'M JUST ON A VISIT TO MY AUNT WHO HAS GONE TO PORTLAND I USED TO BE HERE AS A BOY AND I AM VERY FOND OF THE SPOT
1553-140048-0016 I DON'T THINK ANYTHING TAKES THE PLACE OF THE FARM WHERE ONE LIVED WHEN ONE WAS A CHILD OBSERVED REBECCA NEARLY BURSTING WITH PRIDE AT HAVING AT LAST SUCCESSFULLY USED THE INDEFINITE PRONOUN IN GENERAL CONVERSATION
1553-140048-0017 SO YOU CONSIDER YOUR CHILDHOOD A THING OF THE PAST DO YOU YOUNG LADY I CAN STILL REMEMBER IT ANSWERED REBECCA GRAVELY THOUGH IT SEEMS A LONG TIME AGO

1553-140048-0021 HOW MUCH HAS YOUR AUNT ON HAND NOW SUGGESTED THE VERY MODEST AND INEXPERIENCED AGENT AND HOW MUCH WOULD SHE NEED
1553-140048-0022 I'M NOT CERTAIN SAID REBECCA CONSCIENTIOUSLY BUT I'LL LOOK IN THE CIRCULAR IT'S SURE TO TELL AND SHE DREW THE DOCUMENT FROM HER POCKET WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THE MAGNIFICENT PROFITS YOU GET FROM THIS BUSINESS
1553-140048-0023 WE ARE NOT SELLING FOR OUR OWN BENEFIT SAID REBECCA CONFIDENTIALLY MY FRIEND WHO IS HOLDING THE HORSE AT THE GATE IS THE DAUGHTER OF A VERY RICH BLACKSMITH AND DOESN'T NEED ANY MONEY
1553-140048-0024 WE ARE TRYING TO GET A PREMIUM FOR SOME FRIENDS OF OURS REBECCA HAD NEVER THOUGHT OF ALLUDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH HER PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS BUT UNEXPECTEDLY SHE FOUND HERSELF DESCRIBING MISTER SIMPSON MISSUS SIMPSON AND THE SIMPSON FAMILY
1553-140048-0025 THEIR POVERTY THEIR JOYLESS LIFE AND THEIR ABJECT NEED OF A BANQUET LAMP TO BRIGHTEN THEIR EXISTENCE YOU NEEDN'T ARGUE THAT POINT LAUGHED THE MAN AS HE STOOD UP TO GET A GLIMPSE OF THE RICH BLACKSMITH'S DAUGHTER AT THE GATE
1553-140048-0026 I CAN SEE THAT THEY OUGHT TO HAVE IT IF THEY WANT IT AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE IT I'VE KNOWN WHAT IT WAS MYSELF TO DO WITHOUT A BANQUET LAMP NOW GIVE ME THE CIRCULAR AND LET'S DO SOME FIGURING HOW MUCH DO THE SIMPSONS LACK AT THIS MOMENT
1553-140048-0027 IF THEY SELL TWO HUNDRED MORE CAKES THIS MONTH AND NEXT THEY CAN HAVE THE LAMP BY CHRISTMAS REBECCA ANSWERED AND THEY CAN GET A SHADE BY SUMMER TIME BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T HELP VERY MUCH AFTER TO DAY BECAUSE MY AUNT MIRANDA MAY NOT LIKE TO HAVE ME
1553-140048-0028 I SEE WELL THAT'S ALL RIGHT I'LL TAKE THREE HUNDRED CAKES AND THAT WILL GIVE THEM SHADE AND ALL
1553-140048-0029 TIPPED OVER AND DISAPPEARED INTO A CLUMP OF LILAC BUSHES IT WAS A VERY SHORT DISTANCE FORTUNATELY AND THE AMUSED CAPITALIST PICKED HER UP SET HER ON HER FEET AND BRUSHED HER OFF YOU SHOULD NEVER SEEM SURPRISED WHEN YOU HAVE TAKEN A LARGE ORDER SAID HE
1553-140048-0030 YOU OUGHT TO HAVE REPLIED CAN'T YOU MAKE IT THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY INSTEAD OF CAPSIZING IN THAT UNBUSINESSLIKE WAY OH I COULD NEVER SAY ANYTHING LIKE THAT EXCLAIMED REBECCA WHO WAS BLUSHING CRIMSON AT HER AWKWARD FALL

1553-140048-0038 IT WOULD BE RATHER A NICE SURPRISE TO HAVE THE LAMP ARRIVE AT THE SIMPSONS ON THANKSGIVING DAY WOULDN'T IT HE ASKED AS HE TUCKED THE OLD LAP ROBE COSILY OVER THEIR FEET
1553-140048-0039 OH DON'T MENTION IT LAUGHED MISTER ALADDIN LIFTING HIS HAT I WAS A SORT OF COMMERCIAL TRAVELER MYSELF ONCE YEARS AGO AND I LIKE TO SEE THE THING WELL DONE GOOD BY MISS REBECCA ROWENA

1553-140048-0042 IN AN ECSTASY OF REMINISCENCE OH ISN'T HE PERFECTLY ELERGANT AND WASN'T IT LOVELY OF HIM TO BUY US OUT AND JUST THINK OF HAVING BOTH THE LAMP AND THE SHADE FOR ONE DAY'S WORK AREN'T YOU GLAD YOU WORE YOUR PINK GINGHAM NOW
1553-140048-0043 EVEN IF MOTHER DID MAKE YOU PUT ON FLANNEL UNDERNEATH YOU DO LOOK SO PRETTY IN PINK AND RED REBECCA AND SO HOMELY IN DRAB AND BROWN I KNOW IT SIGHED REBECCA I WISH I WAS LIKE YOU PRETTY IN ALL COLORS
1553-140048-0044 AND REBECCA LOOKED LONGINGLY AT EMMA JANE'S FAT ROSY CHEEKS AT HER BLUE EYES WHICH SAID NOTHING AT HER NEAT NOSE WHICH HAD NO CHARACTER AT HER RED LIPS FROM BETWEEN WHICH NO WORD WORTH LISTENING TO HAD EVER ISSUED
1553-140048-0045 NEVER MIND SAID EMMA JANE COMFORTINGLY EVERYBODY SAYS YOU'RE AWFUL BRIGHT AND SMART AND MOTHER THINKS YOU'LL BE BETTER LOOKING ALL THE TIME AS YOU GROW OLDER YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT BUT I WAS A DREADFUL HOMELY BABY
1553-140048-0046 AUNT MIRANDA WOULD SAY THAT WAS JUST LIKE ME AND IT IS BUT I CALLED HIM MISTER ALADDIN BECAUSE HE GAVE US A LAMP YOU KNOW THE STORY OF ALADDIN AND THE WONDERFUL LAMP
1553-140048-0047 OH REBECCA HOW COULD YOU CALL HIM A NICKNAME THE VERY FIRST TIME YOU EVER SAW HIM ALADDIN ISN'T A NICKNAME EXACTLY ANYWAY HE LAUGHED AND SEEMED TO LIKE IT
1553-140048-0048 BY DINT OF SUPERHUMAN EFFORT AND PUTTING SUCH A SEAL UPON THEIR LIPS AS NEVER MORTALS PUT BEFORE THE TWO GIRLS SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THEIR WONDERFUL NEWS TO THEMSELVES
1553-140048-0049 ON THANKSGIVING THE LAMP ARRIVED IN A LARGE PACKING BOX AND WAS TAKEN OUT AND SET UP BY SEESAW SIMPSON WHO SUDDENLY BEGAN TO ADMIRE AND RESPECT THE BUSINESS ABILITY OF HIS SISTERS
1578-140045-0000 THE STIRRING OF THE POWERS REBECCA'S VISIT TO MILLTOWN WAS ALL THAT HER GLOWING FANCY HAD PAINTED IT EXCEPT THAT RECENT READINGS ABOUT ROME AND VENICE DISPOSED HER TO BELIEVE THAT THOSE CITIES MIGHT HAVE AN ADVANTAGE OVER MILLTOWN
1578-140045-0001 IN THE MATTER OF MERE PICTORIAL BEAUTY SO SOON DOES THE SOUL OUTGROW ITS MANSIONS THAT AFTER ONCE SEEING MILLTOWN HER FANCY RAN OUT TO THE FUTURE SIGHT OF PORTLAND FOR THAT HAVING ISLANDS AND A HARBOR AND TWO PUBLIC MONUMENTS
1578-140045-0002 MUST BE FAR MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN MILLTOWN WHICH WOULD SHE FELT TAKE ITS PROUD PLACE AMONG THE CITIES OF THE EARTH BY REASON OF ITS TREMENDOUS BUSINESS ACTIVITY RATHER THAN BY ANY IRRESISTIBLE APPEAL TO THE IMAGINATION
1578-140045-0003 I TELL YOU HARRIET BEECHER STOWE HERSELF COULDN'T A DONE IT BETTER JUSTICE I TOOK IT ALL IN RESPONDED MISTER COBB WHO WAS PLEASED THAT MOTHER AGREED WITH HIM ABOUT REBECCA I AIN'T SURE BUT SHE'S GOIN TO TURN OUT SOMETHIN REMARKABLE
1578-140045-0004 LAND NO MOTHER THERE AIN'T NO HOME'PATH BOUT MISS PARKS SHE DRIVES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY I CAN'T SEE REBECCA AS A LADY DOCTOR SOMEHOW MUSED MISSUS COBB HER GIFT O GAB IS WHAT'S GOIN TO BE THE MAKIN OF HER
1578-140045-0005 OR RECITE PIECES LIKE THAT PORTLAND ELOCUTIONIST THAT COME OUT HERE TO THE HARVEST SUPPER I GUESS SHE'LL BE ABLE TO WRITE DOWN HER OWN PIECES SAID MISTER COBB CONFIDENTLY SHE COULD MAKE EM UP FASTER N SHE COULD READ EM OUT OF A BOOK
1578-140045-0006 REBECCA MADE A POOR HAND AT COMPOSITION WRITING AT THIS TIME MISS DEARBORN GAVE HER EVERY SORT OF SUBJECT THAT SHE HAD EVER BEEN GIVEN HERSELF CLOUD PICTURES ABRAHAM LINCOLN NATURE PHILANTHROPY SLAVERY INTEMPERANCE JOY AND DUTY
1578-140045-0007 SOLITUDE BUT WITH NONE OF THEM DID REBECCA SEEM TO GRAPPLE SATISFACTORILY WRITE AS YOU TALK REBECCA INSISTED POOR MISS DEARBORN WHO SECRETLY KNEW THAT SHE COULD NEVER MANAGE A GOOD COMPOSITION HERSELF
1578-140045-0008 NOW IN YOUR LAST ONE ON SOLITUDE YOU HAVEN'T SAID ANYTHING VERY INTERESTING AND YOU'VE MADE IT TOO COMMON AND EVERY DAY TO SOUND WELL THERE ARE TOO MANY YOUS AND YOURS IN IT YOU OUGHT TO SAY ONE NOW AND THEN TO MAKE IT SEEM MORE LIKE GOOD WRITING ONE OPENS A FAVORITE BOOK
1578-140045-0009 ONE'S THOUGHTS ARE A GREAT COMFORT IN SOLITUDE AND SO ON I DON'T KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT SOLITUDE THIS WEEK THAN I DID ABOUT JOY AND DUTY LAST WEEK GRUMBLED REBECCA YOU TRIED TO BE FUNNY ABOUT JOY AND DUTY SAID MISS DEARBORN REPROVINGLY SO OF COURSE YOU DIDN'T SUCCEED
1578-140045-0010 OF RECOLLECTION JOY AND DUTY HAD BEEN THE INSPIRING SUBJECT GIVEN TO THE OLDER CHILDREN FOR A THEME TO BE WRITTEN IN FIVE MINUTES REBECCA HAD WRESTLED STRUGGLED PERSPIRED IN VAIN WHEN HER TURN CAME TO READ
1578-140045-0011 SHE WAS OBLIGED TO CONFESS SHE HAD WRITTEN NOTHING YOU HAVE AT LEAST TWO LINES REBECCA INSISTED THE TEACHER FOR I SEE THEM ON YOUR SLATE
1578-140045-0012 READ WHAT YOU HAVE GOOD OR BAD LITTLE OR MUCH I AM EXCUSING NOBODY REBECCA ROSE OVERCOME WITH SECRET LAUGHTER DREAD AND MORTIFICATION THEN IN A LOW VOICE SHE READ THE COUPLET
1578-140045-0013 AND THE TRAINING OF THE YOUNG IDEA SELDOM APPEALED TO THE SENSE OF HUMOR YOU MUST STAY AFTER SCHOOL AND TRY AGAIN REBECCA SHE SAID BUT SHE SAID IT SMILINGLY YOUR POETRY HASN'T A VERY NICE IDEA IN IT FOR A GOOD LITTLE GIRL WHO OUGHT TO LOVE DUTY
1578-140045-0014 IT WASN'T MY IDEA SAID REBECCA APOLOGETICALLY I HAD ONLY MADE THE FIRST LINE WHEN I SAW YOU WERE GOING TO RING THE BELL AND SAY THE TIME WAS UP I HAD CLASH WRITTEN AND I COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING THEN BUT HASH OR RASH OR SMASH I'LL CHANGE IT TO THIS
1578-140045-0015 HAVING BEEN INSTRUCTED IN THE USE OF THE INDEFINITE PRONOUN ONE AS GIVING A REFINED AND ELEGANT TOUCH TO LITERARY EFFORTS REBECCA PAINSTAKINGLY REWROTE HER COMPOSITION ON SOLITUDE GIVING IT ALL THE BENEFIT OF MISS DEARBORN'S SUGGESTION
1578-140045-0016 IT THEN APPEARED IN THE FOLLOWING FORM WHICH HARDLY SATISFIED EITHER TEACHER OR PUPIL SOLITUDE IT WOULD BE FALSE TO SAY THAT ONE COULD EVER BE ALONE WHEN ONE HAS ONE'S LOVELY THOUGHTS TO COMFORT ONE
1578-140045-0017 ONE SITS BY ONE'S SELF IT IS TRUE BUT ONE THINKS ONE OPENS ONE'S FAVORITE BOOK AND READS ONE'S FAVORITE STORY ONE SPEAKS TO ONE'S AUNT OR ONE'S BROTHER FONDLES ONE'S CAT
1578-140045-0018 DOES ONE EVER FEEL BEREFT WHEN ONE PICKS UP ONE'S CHIPS TO LIGHT ONE'S FIRE FOR ONE'S EVENING MEAL OR WHEN ONE WASHES ONE'S MILK PAIL BEFORE MILKING ONE'S COW ONE WOULD FANCY NOT R R R
1578-140045-0019 DON'T YOU THINK CALLING SUPPER ONE'S EVENING MEAL IS PRETTY AND ISN'T BEREFT A NICE WORD YES THAT PART OF IT DOES VERY WELL IT IS THE CAT THE CHIPS AND THE MILK PAIL THAT I DON'T LIKE
1578-140045-0020 YES I DON'T LIKE A COW IN A COMPOSITION SAID THE DIFFICULT MISS DEARBORN
1578-140045-0021 FOR THE NEXT WEEK MINNIE SMELLIE'S MOTHER TOLD MIRANDA SAWYER THAT SHE'D BETTER LOOK AFTER REBECCA FOR SHE WAS GIVEN TO SWEARING AND PROFANE LANGUAGE THAT SHE HAD BEEN HEARD SAYING SOMETHING DREADFUL THAT VERY AFTERNOON SAYING IT BEFORE EMMA JANE AND LIVING PERKINS WHO ONLY LAUGHED
1578-140045-0022 DON'T BE UGLY AND OBSTINATE BUT THINK REAL HARD WHEN DID THEY CHASE YOU UP THE ROAD AND WHAT WERE YOU DOING A SUDDEN LIGHT BROKE UPON REBECCA'S DARKNESS
1578-140045-0023 EMMA JANE LIVING AND I WERE WALKING ALONG AND I WAS AHEAD I SAW THE WATER STREAMING OVER THE ROAD TOWARDS THE DITCH AND IT REMINDED ME OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN AT MILLTOWN WHEN ELIZA TOOK HER BABY AND RAN ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI ON THE ICE BLOCKS PURSUED BY THE BLOODHOUNDS
1578-140045-0024 WE COULDN'T KEEP FROM LAUGHING AFTER WE CAME OUT OF THE TENT BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTING ON SUCH A SMALL PLATFORM THAT ELIZA HAD TO RUN ROUND AND ROUND
1578-140045-0025 AND PART OF THE TIME SHE HAD TO PURSUE THE DOG I KNEW LIVING WOULD REMEMBER TOO SO I TOOK OFF MY WATERPROOF AND WRAPPED IT ROUND MY BOOKS FOR A BABY
1578-140045-0026 JUST LIKE THAT THE SAME AS ELIZA DID IN THE PLAY THEN I LEAPED FROM PUDDLE TO PUDDLE AND LIVING AND EMMA JANE PURSUED ME LIKE THE BLOODHOUNDS IT'S JUST LIKE THAT STUPID MINNIE SMELLIE WHO DOESN'T KNOW A GAME WHEN SHE SEES ONE AND ELIZA WASN'T SWEARING WHEN SHE SAID MY GOD THE RIVER
1578-140045-0027 IT WAS MORE LIKE PRAYING WELL YOU'VE GOT NO CALL TO BE PRAYIN ANY MORE THAN SWEARIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD SAID MIRANDA BUT I'M THANKFUL IT'S NO WORSE YOU'RE BORN TO TROUBLE AS THE SPARKS FLY UPWARD
1578-140045-0028 AN I'M AFRAID YOU ALLERS WILL BE TILL YOU LEARN TO BRIDLE YOUR UNRULY TONGUE I WISH SOMETIMES THAT I COULD BRIDLE MINNIE'S MURMURED REBECCA AS SHE WENT TO SET THE TABLE FOR SUPPER I DECLARE SHE IS THE BEATIN'EST CHILD SAID MIRANDA
1578-140045-0029 BUT WHETHER IT'S FOR THE BETTER OR THE WORSE I CAN'T HARDLY TELL TILL SHE GROWS UP SHE'S GOT THE MAKING OF MOST ANYTHING IN HER REBECCA HAS BUT I FEEL SOMETIMES AS IF WE WERE NOT FITTED TO COPE WITH HER STUFF AN NONSENSE SAID MIRANDA
1578-140049-0000 THE BANQUET LAMP THERE HAD BEEN COMPANY AT THE BRICK HOUSE TO THE BOUNTIFUL THANKSGIVING DINNER WHICH HAD BEEN PROVIDED AT ONE O'CLOCK THE BURNHAM SISTERS WHO LIVED BETWEEN NORTH RIVERBORO AND SHAKER VILLAGE AND WHO FOR MORE THAN A QUARTER OF A CENTURY
1578-140049-0001 HAD COME TO PASS THE HOLIDAY WITH THE SAWYERS EVERY YEAR REBECCA SAT SILENT WITH A BOOK AFTER THE DINNER DISHES WERE WASHED AND WHEN IT WAS NEARLY FIVE ASKED IF SHE MIGHT GO TO THE SIMPSONS
1578-140049-0002 CAN'T YOU SET STILL FOR ONCE AND LISTEN TO THE IMPROVIN CONVERSATION OF YOUR ELDERS
1578-140049-0003 WHAT UNDER THE CANOPY DID THEY WANT OF A LAMP AND WHERE DID THEY GET THE MONEY TO PAY FOR IT IF ABNER WAS AT HOME I SHOULD THINK HE'D BEEN SWAPPIN AGAIN SAID MISS MIRANDA THE CHILDREN GOT IT AS A PRIZE FOR SELLING SOAP REPLIED REBECCA
1578-140049-0004 WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN THE POCKET OF THAT NEW DRESS THAT MAKES IT SAG DOWN SO IT'S MY NUTS AND RAISINS FROM DINNER REPLIED REBECCA WHO NEVER SUCCEEDED IN KEEPING THE MOST INNOCENT ACTION A SECRET FROM HER AUNT MIRANDA THEY'RE JUST WHAT YOU GAVE ME ON MY PLATE WHY DIDN'T YOU EAT THEM
1578-140049-0005 THEY WERE YOUR OWN REBECCA INTERPOSED AUNT JANE AND IF YOU CHOSE TO SAVE THEM TO GIVE AWAY IT IS ALL RIGHT WE OUGHT NEVER TO LET THIS DAY PASS WITHOUT GIVING OUR NEIGHBORS SOMETHING TO BE THANKFUL FOR INSTEAD OF TAKING ALL THE TIME TO THINK OF OUR OWN MERCIES
1578-140049-0006 THE BURNHAM SISTERS NODDED APPROVINGLY AS REBECCA WENT OUT AND REMARKED THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN A CHILD GROW AND IMPROVE SO FAST IN SO SHORT A TIME THERE'S PLENTY OF ROOM LEFT FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT AS YOU'D KNOW IF SHE LIVED IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH YOU ANSWERED MIRANDA
1578-140049-0007 ONE OF THEM MUST HAVE SAID MISS ELLEN BURNHAM
1578-140049-0008 IT MUST HAVE BEEN CLARA BELLE AND I SHOULD NEVER CALL HER REMARKABLE ANSWERED MISS MIRANDA HAS ADAM BEEN HOME AGAIN YES HE'S BEEN STAYING A FEW DAYS WITH HIS AUNT THERE'S NO LIMIT TO THE MONEY HE'S MAKING THEY SAY AND HE ALWAYS BRINGS PRESENTS FOR ALL THE NEIGHBORS
1578-140049-0009 THIS TIME IT WAS A FULL SET OF FURS FOR MISSUS LADD AND TO THINK WE CAN REMEMBER THE TIME HE WAS A BAREFOOT BOY WITHOUT TWO SHIRTS TO HIS BACK IT IS STRANGE HE HASN'T MARRIED WITH ALL HIS MONEY AND HIM SO FOND OF CHILDREN THAT HE ALWAYS HAS A PACK OF THEM AT HIS HEELS
1578-140049-0010 THERE'S HOPE FOR HIM STILL THOUGH SAID MISS JANE SMILINGLY FOR I DON'T S'POSE HE'S MORE THAN THIRTY HE COULD GET A WIFE IN RIVERBORO IF HE WAS A HUNDRED AND THIRTY REMARKED MISS MIRANDA ADAM'S AUNT SAYS HE WAS SO TAKEN WITH THE LITTLE GIRL THAT SOLD THE SOAP CLARA BELLE DID YOU SAY HER NAME WAS

1578-140049-0012 FOR THIS ONE COULDN'T HAVE BEEN CROSS EYED I REMEMBER MISSUS LADD SAYING ADAM REMARKED ABOUT THIS CHILD'S HANDSOME EYES HE SAID IT WAS HER EYES THAT MADE HIM BUY THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES MISSUS LADD HAS IT STACKED UP IN THE SHED CHAMBER
1578-140049-0013 THREE HUNDRED CAKES EJACULATED MIRANDA WELL THERE'S ONE CROP THAT NEVER FAILS IN RIVERBORO WHAT'S THAT ASKED MISS LYDIA POLITELY THE FOOL CROP RESPONDED MIRANDA TERSELY
1578-140049-0014 AND CHANGED THE SUBJECT MUCH TO JANE'S GRATITUDE FOR SHE HAD BEEN NERVOUS AND ILL AT EASE FOR THE LAST FIFTEEN MINUTES WHAT CHILD IN RIVERBORO COULD BE DESCRIBED AS REMARKABLE AND WINNING SAVE REBECCA WHAT CHILD HAD WONDERFUL EYES EXCEPT THE SAME REBECCA
1578-140049-0015 AND FINALLY WAS THERE EVER A CHILD IN THE WORLD WHO COULD MAKE A MAN BUY SOAP BY THE HUNDRED CAKES SAVE REBECCA MEANTIME THE REMARKABLE CHILD HAD FLOWN UP THE ROAD IN THE DEEPENING DUSK BUT SHE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE SHE HEARD THE SOUND OF HURRYING FOOTSTEPS
1578-140049-0016 AND SAW A WELL KNOWN FIGURE COMING IN HER DIRECTION IN A MOMENT SHE AND EMMA JANE MET AND EXCHANGED A BREATHLESS EMBRACE SOMETHING AWFUL HAS HAPPENED PANTED EMMA JANE DON'T TELL ME IT'S BROKEN EXCLAIMED REBECCA NO OH NO NOT THAT
1578-140049-0017 OUR SELLING THE THREE HUNDRED CAKES CORRECTED REBECCA YOU DID AS MUCH AS I NO I DIDN'T REBECCA RANDALL I JUST SAT AT THE GATE AND HELD THE HORSE YES BUT WHOSE HORSE WAS IT THAT TOOK US TO NORTH RIVERBORO
1578-140049-0018 BUT WHAT'S THE TROUBLE THE SIMPSONS HAVE NO KEROSENE AND NO WICKS I GUESS THEY THOUGHT A BANQUET LAMP WAS SOMETHING THAT LIGHTED ITSELF AND BURNED WITHOUT ANY HELP SEESAW HAS GONE TO THE DOCTOR'S TO TRY IF HE CAN BORROW A WICK AND MOTHER LET ME HAVE A PINT OF OIL BUT SHE SAYS SHE WON'T GIVE ME ANY MORE
1578-140049-0019 WE NEVER THOUGHT OF THE EXPENSE OF KEEPING UP THE LAMP REBECCA NO WE DIDN'T BUT LET'S NOT WORRY ABOUT THAT TILL AFTER THE PARTY I HAVE A HANDFUL OF NUTS AND RAISINS AND SOME APPLES I HAVE PEPPERMINTS AND MAPLE SUGAR SAID EMMA JANE THEY HAD A REAL THANKSGIVING DINNER

1578-140049-0024 THE LAMP IT WAS TACITLY FELT BY EVERYBODY WAS DIGNIFYING THE PARTY AND PROVIDING SUFFICIENT ENTERTAINMENT SIMPLY BY ITS PRESENCE BEING FULLY AS SATISFACTORY IN ITS WAY AS A PIANOLA OR A STRING BAND I WISH FATHER COULD SEE IT SAID CLARA BELLE LOYALLY
1578-140049-0025 MURMURED SUSAN SAGACIOUSLY AT THE APPOINTED HOUR REBECCA DRAGGED HERSELF RELUCTANTLY AWAY FROM THE ENCHANTING SCENE

1578-140049-0036 THERE CAN'T BE ANYTHING WRONG THIS TIME REBECCA ANSWERED CONFIDENTLY EMMA JANE SOLD HER CAKES TO HER OWN RELATIONS AND TO UNCLE JERRY COBB AND I WENT FIRST TO THOSE NEW TENEMENTS NEAR THE LUMBER MILL AND THEN TO THE LADDS MISTER LADD BOUGHT ALL WE HAD AND MADE US PROMISE TO KEEP THE SECRET UNTIL THE PREMIUM CAME
1578-140049-0037 REBECCA'S HAIR WAS LOOSENED AND FALLING OVER HER FOREHEAD IN RUFFLED WAVES HER EYES WERE BRILLIANT HER CHEEKS CRIMSON THERE WAS A HINT OF EVERYTHING IN THE GIRL'S FACE OF SENSITIVENESS AND DELICACY AS WELL AS OF ARDOR
1578-140049-0038 THERE WAS THE SWEETNESS OF THE MAYFLOWER AND THE STRENGTH OF THE YOUNG OAK BUT ONE COULD EASILY DIVINE THAT SHE WAS ONE OF THE SOULS BY NATURE PITCHED TOO HIGH BY SUFFERING PLUNGED TOO LOW
1578-6379-0000 THE THIRD MAN FROM THE END OH PATTY DID YOU BRING US SOME WEDDING CAKE DID YOU HAVE ANY ADVENTURES
1578-6379-0001 WITH THE DEXTERITY OF PRACTICE SPRANG UPON THE REAR STEP OF THE HEARSE AS IT TURNED IN AT THE SCHOOL GATE AND ROLLED UP THE CURVING DRIVE TO THE PORTE COCHERE THE HEARSE WAS THE POPULAR NAME FOR THE BLACK VARNISHED WAGONETTE WHICH CONVEYED THE PUPILS OF SAINT URSULA'S FROM CHURCH AND STATION
1578-6379-0002 IT WAS PLANNED TO ACCOMMODATE TWENTY PATTY AND HER SUIT CASE ALONE IN THE CAPACIOUS INTERIOR WERE JOLTING ABOUT LIKE TWO TINY PEAS IN A VERY BIG POD
1578-6379-0003 AS THEY CAME TO A STOP THEY WERE BESIEGED BY A CROWD OF BLUE COATED GIRLS IT WAS AFTERNOON RECREATION AND THE WHOLE SCHOOL WAS ABROAD THE WELCOME THAT SHE RECEIVED WOULD HAVE LED AN ONLOOKER TO INFER THAT PATTY HAD BEEN GONE THREE MONTHS INSTEAD OF THREE DAYS SHE AND HER TWO

1578-6379-0008 MISS JELLINGS WAS INSISTENT THAT RECREATION SHOULD BE ACTIVELY PURSUED OUT OF DOORS THE TWO COULD EASILY HAVE OBTAINED PERMISSION TO GREET PATTY'S RETURN INSIDE BUT IT WAS THE POLICY OF THE TRIO NEVER TO ASK PERMISSION IN MINOR MATTERS IT WASTED ONE'S CREDIT UNNECESSARILY
1578-6379-0009 PRISCILLA AND CONNY TURNED UPSTAIRS LUGGING THE SUIT CASE BETWEEN THEM WHILE PATTY APPROACHED THE PRINCIPAL'S STUDY TEN MINUTES LATER SHE JOINED HER COMPANIONS IN SEVEN PARADISE ALLEY THEY WERE SITTING ON THE BED THEIR CHINS IN THEIR HANDS

1578-6379-0047 PUNCTUATED BY AN OCCASIONAL DEEP BASS LAUGH WHEN THEY HEARD THE FRONT DOOR CLOSE WITH ONE ACCORD THEY INVADED HARRIET GLADDEN'S ROOM WHICH COMMANDED THE WALK AND PRESSED THEIR NOSES AGAINST THE PANE A SHORT THICK SET MAN OF GERMAN BUILD WAS WADDLING TOWARD THE GATE AND THE TROLLEY CAR
1578-6379-0048 THEY GAZED WITH WIDE HORRIFIED EYES AND TURNED WITHOUT A WORD TO MEET PATTY AS SHE TRUDGED UPSTAIRS LUGGING HER ERRANT SUIT CASE A GLANCE TOLD HER THAT THEY HAD SEEN AND DROPPING ON THE TOP STEP SHE LEANED HER HEAD AGAINST THE RAILING AND LAUGHED
1594-135914-0000 IN THIS MISERABLE STATE THEY CAME TO THE FIRST VILLAGE THE PEASANTS WIVES FLOCKED ABOUT THEM AND AS IT APPEARED THROUGH THEIR DISGUISE THAT THEY WERE PEOPLE OF SOME CONDITION ASKED THEM WHAT WAS THE OCCASION OF THEIR TRAVELLING IN A HABIT THAT DID NOT SEEM TO BELONG TO THEM
1594-135914-0001 INSTEAD OF ANSWERING THE QUESTION THEY FELL TO WEEPING WHICH ONLY SERVED TO HEIGHTEN THE CURIOSITY OF THE PEASANTS AND TO MOVE THEIR COMPASSION GANEM'S MOTHER TOLD THEM WHAT SHE AND HER DAUGHTER HAD ENDURED AT WHICH THE GOOD COUNTRYWOMEN WERE SENSIBLY AFFLICTED
1594-135914-0002 AND ENDEAVOURED TO COMFORT THEM THEY TREATED THEM AS WELL AS THEIR POVERTY WOULD PERMIT TOOK OFF THEIR HORSE HAIR SHIFTS WHICH WERE VERY UNEASY TO THEM AND PUT ON THEM OTHERS WHICH THEY GAVE THEM WITH SHOES AND SOMETHING TO COVER THEIR HEADS AND SAVE THEIR HAIR
1594-135914-0003 JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER DEPARTED FROM THAT VILLAGE TAKING SHORT JOURNEYS TOWARDS ALEPPO THEY USED AT DUSK TO RETIRE NEAR OR INTO THE MOSQUES WHERE THEY PASSED THE NIGHT ON THE MAT IF THERE WAS ANY
1594-135914-0004 OR ELSE ON THE BARE PAVEMENT AND SOMETIMES RESTED IN THE PUBLIC PLACES APPOINTED FOR THE USE OF TRAVELLERS AS FOR SUSTENANCE THEY DID NOT WANT FOR THEY OFTEN CAME TO PLACES WHERE BREAD BOILED RICE AND OTHER PROVISIONS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO ALL TRAVELLERS WHO DESIRE IT
1594-135914-0005 AT LENGTH THEY CAME TO ALEPPO BUT WOULD NOT STAY THERE AND CONTINUING THEIR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE EUPHRATES CROSSED THE RIVER
1594-135914-0006 THENCE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEY HAD ENDURED THEY PROCEEDED TO BAGDAD THAT WAS THE PLACE THEY HAD FIXED THEIR THOUGHTS UPON
1594-135914-0007 BUT THEY HOPED BECAUSE THEY WISHED IT THEIR AFFECTION FOR HIM INCREASING INSTEAD OF DIMINISHING WITH THEIR MISFORTUNES THEIR CONVERSATION WAS GENERALLY ABOUT HIM AND THEY INQUIRED FOR HIM OF ALL THEY MET BUT LET US LEAVE JALIB AL KOOLLOOB AND HER MOTHER
1594-135914-0008 AND RETURN TO FETNAH SHE WAS STILL CONFINED CLOSELY IN THE DARK TOWER SINCE THE DAY THAT HAD BEEN SO FATAL TO GANEM AND HERSELF HOWEVER DISAGREEABLE AS HER PRISON WAS TO HER IT WAS MUCH LESS GRIEVOUS THAN THE THOUGHTS OF GANEM'S MISFORTUNE
1594-135914-0009 THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHOSE FATE WAS A KILLING AFFLICTION THERE WAS SCARCELY A MOMENT IN WHICH SHE DID NOT LAMENT HIM
1594-135914-0010 AND SOMETIMES BY THOSE NIGHT WALKS CAME TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN HIS COURT WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE REACHED HIS EAR ONE OF THOSE NIGHTS IN HIS WALK HE HAPPENED TO PASS BY THE DARK TOWER AND FANCYING HE HEARD SOMEBODY TALK
1594-135914-0011 STOPS AND DRAWING NEAR THE DOOR TO LISTEN DISTINCTLY HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH FETNAH WHOSE THOUGHTS WERE ALWAYS ON GANEM UTTERED WITH A LOUD VOICE O GANEM TOO UNFORTUNATE GANEM WHERE ARE YOU AT THIS TIME

1594-135914-0013 THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WHO OUGHT TO HAVE REWARDED PERSECUTES YOU AND IN REQUITAL FOR HAVING ALWAYS REGARDED ME AS A PERSON RESERVED FOR HIS BED YOU LOSE YOUR FORTUNE AND ARE OBLIGED TO SEEK FOR SAFETY IN FLIGHT
1594-135914-0014 HOW CAN YOU EXCULPATE YOURSELF WHEN YOU SHALL APPEAR WITH GANEM BEFORE THE TRIBUNAL OF THE SUPREME JUDGE AND THE ANGELS SHALL TESTIFY THE TRUTH BEFORE YOUR FACE ALL THE POWER YOU ARE NOW INVESTED WITH AND WHICH MAKES ALMOST THE WHOLE WORLD TREMBLE
1594-135914-0015 WILL NOT PREVENT YOUR BEING CONDEMNED AND PUNISHED FOR YOUR VIOLENT AND UNJUST PROCEEDINGS HERE FETNAH CEASED HER COMPLAINTS HER SIGHS AND TEARS PUTTING A STOP TO HER UTTERANCE
1594-135914-0016 HE PLAINLY PERCEIVED THAT IF WHAT HE HAD HEARD WAS TRUE HIS FAVOURITE MUST BE INNOCENT AND THAT HE HAD BEEN TOO HASTY IN GIVING SUCH ORDERS AGAINST GANEM AND HIS FAMILY
1594-135914-0017 HE WAS OVERJOYED AT THE THOUGHT FOR HE RESPECTED FETNAH AND HAD BEEN MUCH CONCERNED AT HER DISGRACE THEREFORE FLYING INSTANTLY TO THE TOWER MADAM SAID HE TO THE FAVOURITE WITH SUCH AN AIR AS EXPRESSED HIS SATISFACTION BE PLEASED TO FOLLOW ME
1594-135914-0018 I HOPE YOU WILL NEVER MORE RETURN TO THIS MELANCHOLY ABODE THE COMMANDER OF THE FAITHFUL WISHES TO SPEAK WITH YOU AND I DRAW FROM THIS A HAPPY OMEN
1594-135914-0019 SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HIM AND SO CONTINUED HER FACE BATHED IN TEARS

1594-135914-0024 I MUST OWN THAT FROM THE FIRST MOMENT HE SAW ME HE PERHAPS DESIGNED TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO ME AND CONCEIVED HOPES OF ENGAGING ME TO ADMIT HIS LOVE I GUESSED AT THIS BY THE EAGERNESS WHICH HE SHEWED IN ENTERTAINING ME
1594-135914-0025 AND DOING ME ALL THE GOOD OFFICES I SO MUCH WANTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES I WAS THEN IN BUT AS SOON AS HE HEARD THAT I HAD THE HONOUR TO BELONG TO YOU AH MADAM SAID HE THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE FROM THAT MOMENT

1594-135914-0030 THAT WHICH BELONGS TO THE MASTER IS FORBIDDEN TO THE SLAVE THIS INGENUOUS CONFESSION
1594-135914-0031 AND ENLARGING ON THE OBLIGATIONS SHE OWED TO GANEM BUT ABOVE ALL SHE HIGHLY EXTOLLED HIS DISCRETION

1594-135914-0047 I MET THEM YESTERDAY AS THEY WERE COMING INTO THE CITY THEY WERE IN A DEPLORABLE CONDITION AND IT MOVED ME THE MORE BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE PERSONS OF RANK THROUGH ALL THE RAGS THAT COVERED THEM NOTWITHSTANDING THE IMPRESSION THE SUN HAS MADE ON THEIR FACES
1594-135914-0048 WHILST SHE HERSELF LED THEM TO OUR WARM BATH AND GAVE THEM CLEAN LINEN
1594-135914-0049 BECAUSE WE WISH TO LET THEM TAKE SOME REST BEFORE WE TROUBLE THEM WITH OUR QUESTIONS FETNAH WITHOUT KNOWING WHY FELT A CURIOSITY TO SEE THEM THE SYNDIC WOULD HAVE CONDUCTED HER TO HIS HOUSE
1594-135914-0050 FOR THEY WERE THE PERSONS THE SYNDIC HAD BEEN SPEAKING OF TO FETNAH THE SYNDIC'S WIFE BEING INFORMED BY THE SLAVE THAT A LADY FROM THE PALACE WAS IN HER HOUSE WAS HASTENING TO MEET HER BUT FETNAH WHO HAD FOLLOWED THE SLAVE DID NOT GIVE HER TIME
1594-135914-0051 ON HER COMING INTO THE CHAMBER THE SYNDIC'S WIFE PROSTRATED HERSELF BEFORE HER
1594-135914-0052 FETNAH RAISED HER UP AND SAID MY GOOD LADY
1594-135914-0053 MADAM ANSWERED THE SYNDIC'S WIFE THEY LIE IN THOSE BEDS YOU SEE BY EACH OTHER
1594-135914-0054 GOOD WOMAN SAID SHE I COME TO OFFER YOU MY ASSISTANCE I HAVE CONSIDERABLE INTEREST IN THIS CITY AND MAY BE OF SERVICE TO YOU AND YOUR COMPANION MADAM ANSWERED GANEM'S MOTHER
1594-135914-0055 THAT FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC'S WIFE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS
1594-135914-0056 SAID TO GANEM'S MOTHER BE SO KIND AS TO TELL US YOUR MISFORTUNES AND RECOUNT YOUR STORY YOU CANNOT MAKE THE RELATION TO ANY PERSONS BETTER DISPOSED TO USE ALL POSSIBLE MEANS TO COMFORT YOU
1594-135914-0057 MADAM REPLIED ABOU AYOUB'S DISCONSOLATE WIDOW A FAVOURITE OF THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS A LADY WHOSE NAME IS FETNAH IS THE OCCASION OF ALL OUR MISFORTUNES THESE WORDS WERE LIKE A THUNDERBOLT TO THE FAVOURITE
1594-135914-0058 BUT SUPPRESSING HER AGITATION AND CONCERN SHE SUFFERED GANEM'S MOTHER TO PROCEED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER
1594-135914-0059 I HAD A SON CALLED GANEM WHO COMING TO TRADE AT BAGDAD HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF CARRYING OFF FETNAH
1594-135914-0060 AND THEN TO BANISH US OUT OF SYRIA FOR EVER BUT HOW UNWORTHY SOEVER OUR USAGE HAS BEEN
1594-135914-0061 WHAT A PLEASURE WOULD IT BE FOR HIS SISTER AND ME TO SEE HIM AGAIN EMBRACING HIM WE SHOULD FORGET THE LOSS OF OUR PROPERTY AND ALL THE EVILS WE HAVE SUFFERED ON HIS ACCOUNT ALAS
1594-135914-0062 NO DOUBT OF IT SAID FETNAH INTERRUPTING HER THERE HE IS NO MORE GUILTY THAN YOU ARE I CAN ASSURE YOU OF HIS INNOCENCE FOR I AM THAT VERY FETNAH YOU SO MUCH COMPLAIN OF WHO THROUGH SOME FATALITY IN MY STARS
1594-135914-0063 HAVE OCCASIONED YOU SO MANY MISFORTUNES TO ME YOU MUST IMPUTE THE LOSS OF YOUR SON IF HE IS NO MORE BUT IF I HAVE OCCASIONED YOUR MISFORTUNE I CAN IN SOME MEASURE RELIEVE IT
1594-135914-0064 AND DOUBT NOT HE WILL DO YOU AS MUCH GOOD AS HE HAS DONE YOU INJURY YOU ARE NO LONGER HIS ENEMIES HE WAITS FOR GANEM TO REQUITE THE SERVICE HE HAS DONE ME BY UNITING OUR FORTUNES HE GIVES ME TO HIM FOR HIS CONSORT
1594-135914-0065 THEREFORE LOOK ON ME AS YOUR DAUGHTER AND PERMIT ME TO VOW ETERNAL DUTY AND AFFECTION HAVING SO SAID SHE BOWED DOWN ON GANEM'S MOTHER WHO WAS SO ASTONISHED THAT SHE COULD RETURN NO ANSWER
1594-135914-0066 FETNAH HELD HER LONG IN HER ARMS AND ONLY LEFT HER TO EMBRACE THE DAUGHTER WHO SITTING UP
1594-135914-0067 THE WEALTH GANEM HAD IN THIS CITY IS NOT LOST IT IS IN MY APARTMENT IN THE PALACE BUT I KNOW ALL THE TREASURE OF THE WORLD CANNOT COMFORT YOU WITHOUT GANEM IF I MAY JUDGE OF YOU BY MYSELF BLOOD IS NO LESS POWERFUL THAN LOVE IN GREAT MINDS
1594-135914-0068 BUT WHY SHOULD WE DESPAIR OF SEEING HIM AGAIN WE SHALL FIND HIM THE HAPPINESS OF MEETING WITH YOU MAKES ME CONCEIVE FRESH HOPES PERHAPS THIS IS THE LAST DAY OF YOUR SUFFERINGS AND THE BEGINNING OF A GREATER FELICITY THAN YOU ENJOYED IN DAMASCUS
1594-135914-0069 WHEN GANEM WAS WITH YOU FETNAH WOULD HAVE PROCEEDED BUT THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS COMING IN INTERRUPTED HER MADAM SAID HE TO HER I COME FROM SEEING A VERY MOVING OBJECT IT IS A YOUNG MAN WHOM A CAMEL DRIVER HAD JUST CARRIED TO AN HOSPITAL
1594-135914-0070 HE WAS BOUND WITH CORDS ON A CAMEL BECAUSE HE HAD NOT STRENGTH ENOUGH TO SIT THEY HAD ALREADY UNBOUND HIM AND WERE CARRYING HIM INTO THE HOSPITAL WHEN I HAPPENED TO PASS BY I WENT UP TO THE YOUNG MAN VIEWED HIM ATTENTIVELY
1594-135914-0071 AND FANCIED HIS COUNTENANCE WAS NOT ALTOGETHER UNKNOWN TO ME I ASKED HIM SOME QUESTIONS CONCERNING HIS FAMILY AND HIS COUNTRY BUT ALL THE ANSWERS I COULD GET WERE SIGHS AND TEARS I TOOK PITY ON HIM
1594-135914-0072 PERCEIVED THAT HE HAD NEED TO HAVE PARTICULAR CARE TAKEN OF HIM I WOULD NOT PERMIT HIM TO BE PUT INTO THE HOSPITAL FOR I AM TOO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THEIR WAY OF MANAGING THE SICK AND AM SENSIBLE OF THE INCAPACITY OF THE PHYSICIANS
1594-135914-0073 I HAVE CAUSED HIM TO BE BROUGHT TO MY OWN HOUSE BY MY SLAVES AND THEY ARE NOW IN A PRIVATE ROOM WHERE I PLACED HIM PUTTING ON SOME OF MY OWN LINEN AND TREATING HIM AS THEY WOULD DO MYSELF FETNAH'S HEART BEAT AT THESE WORDS OF THE JEWELLER
1594-135914-0074 AND SHE FELT A SUDDEN EMOTION FOR WHICH SHE COULD NOT ACCOUNT SHEW ME SAID SHE TO THE SYNDIC INTO THE SICK MAN'S ROOM I SHOULD BE GLAD TO SEE HIM THE SYNDIC CONDUCTED HER AND WHILST SHE WAS GOING THITHER
1594-135914-0075 WHOSE EYES WERE CLOSED HIS COUNTENANCE PALE DISFIGURED AND BATHED IN TEARS SHE GAZED EARNESTLY ON HIM HER HEART BEAT AND SHE FANCIED SHE BEHELD GANEM BUT YET SHE WOULD NOT BELIEVE HER EYES
1594-135914-0076 THOUGH SHE FOUND SOMETHING OF GANEM IN THE OBJETS SHE BEHELD YET IN OTHER RESPECTS HE APPEARED SO DIFFERENT THAT SHE DURST NOT IMAGINE IT WAS HE THAT LAY BEFORE HER UNABLE HOWEVER TO WITHSTAND THE EARNEST DESIRE OF BEING SATISFIED
1594-135914-0077 GANEM SAID SHE WITH A TREMBLING VOICE IS IT YOU I BEHOLD HAVING SPOKEN THESE WORDS SHE STOPPED TO GIVE THE YOUNG MAN TIME TO ANSWER BUT OBSERVING THAT HE SEEMED INSENSIBLE ALAS GANEM ADDED SHE
1594-135914-0078 IT IS NOT YOU THAT I ADDRESS MY IMAGINATION BEING OVERCHARGED WITH YOUR IMAGE HAS GIVEN TO A STRANGER A DECEITFUL RESEMBLANCE
1594-135914-0079 HOWEVER INDISPOSED WOULD KNOW THE VOICE OF FETNAH AT THE NAME OF FETNAH GANEM FOR IT WAS REALLY HE
1594-135914-0080 AH MADAM SAID HE BY WHAT MIRACLE HE COULD SAY NO MORE SUCH A SUDDEN TRANSPORT OF JOY SEIZED HIM THAT HE FAINTED AWAY FETNAH AND THE SYNDIC DID ALL THEY COULD TO BRING HIM TO HIMSELF
1594-135914-0081 BUT AS SOON AS THEY PERCEIVED HE BEGAN TO REVIVE THE SYNDIC DESIRED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW LEST THE SIGHT OF HER SHOULD HEIGHTEN HIS DISORDER THE YOUNG MAN HAVING RECOVERED LOOKED ALL AROUND AND NOT SEEING WHAT HE SOUGHT EXCLAIMED
1594-135914-0082 WHAT IS BECOME OF YOU CHARMING FETNAH DID YOU REALLY APPEAR BEFORE MY EYES OR WAS IT ONLY AN ILLUSION NO SIR SAID THE SYNDIC IT WAS NO ILLUSION IT WAS I THAT CAUSED THE LADY TO WITHDRAW
1594-135914-0083 BUT YOU SHALL SEE HER AGAIN AS SOON AS YOU ARE IN A CONDITION TO BEAR THE INTERVIEW YOU NOW STAND IN NEED OF REST AND NOTHING OUGHT TO OBSTRUCT YOUR TAKING IT THE SITUATION OF YOUR AFFAIRS IS ALTERED SINCE YOU ARE AS I SUPPOSE THAT GANEM
1594-135914-0084 IN FAVOUR OF WHOM THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS HAS CAUSED A PROCLAMATION TO BE MADE IN BAGDAD DECLARING THAT HE FORGIVES HIM WHAT IS PASSED BE SATISFIED FOR THE PRESENT WITH KNOWING SO MUCH
1594-135914-0085 THE LADY WHO JUST NOW SPOKE TO YOU WILL ACQUAINT YOU WITH THE REST THEREFORE THINK OF NOTHING BUT RECOVERING YOUR HEALTH I WILL CONTRIBUTE ALL IN MY POWER TOWARDS IT HAVING SPOKE THESE WORDS HE LEFT GANEM TO TAKE HIS REST
1594-135914-0086 EXHAUSTED BY HARD LIVING AND TOIL
1594-135914-0087 THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THE SYNDIC'S SAYING ANY MORE TO GANEM'S MOTHER AS SOON AS SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE COULD NOT CONVERSE WITH HER SON WITHOUT HAZARDING HIS LIFE SHE CEASED INSISTING TO GO AND SEE HIM
1594-135914-0088 FETNAH THEN SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN FOR HAVING BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER
1594-135914-0089 AND TOMORROW MORNING I WILL RETURN TO YOU THIS SAID SHE EMBRACED THE MOTHER AND THE DAUGHTER AND WENT AWAY AS SOON AS SHE CAME TO THE PALACE
1594-135914-0090 WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY GRANTED AND BEING BROUGHT INTO THE PRINCE'S CLOSET WHERE HE WAS ALONE SHE PROSTRATED HERSELF AT HIS FEET WITH HER FACE ON THE GROUND ACCORDING TO CUSTOM HE COMMANDED HER TO RISE AND HAVING MADE HER SIT DOWN ASKED WHETHER SHE HAD HEARD ANY NEWS OF GANEM
1594-135914-0091 COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS SAID SHE I HAVE BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL THAT I HAVE FOUND HIM AND ALSO HIS MOTHER AND SISTER
1594-135914-0092 AND SHE SATISFIED HIS INQUIRIES SAYING SO MANY THINGS IN COMMENDATION OF GANEM'S MOTHER AND SISTER HE DESIRED TO SEE THEM AS WELL AS THE YOUNG MERCHANT THOUGH HAROON AL RUSHEED WAS PASSIONATE AND IN HIS HEAT SOMETIMES GUILTY OF CRUEL ACTIONS
1594-135914-0093 HAVING THEREFORE NO LONGER CAUSE TO DOUBT BUT THAT HE HAD UNJUSTLY PERSECUTED GANEM AND HIS FAMILY AND HAD PUBLICLY WRONGED THEM HE RESOLVED TO MAKE THEM PUBLIC SATISFACTION
1594-135914-0094 THAT YOUR SEARCH HAS PROVED SO SUCCESSFUL IT IS A REAL SATISFACTION TO ME NOT SO MUCH FOR YOUR SAKE AS FOR MY OWN I WILL KEEP THE PROMISE I HAVE MADE YOU YOU SHALL MARRY GANEM AND I HERE DECLARE YOU ARE NO LONGER MY SLAVE YOU ARE FREE
1594-135914-0095 GO BACK TO THAT YOUNG MERCHANT AND AS SOON AS HE HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH YOU SHALL BRING HIM TO ME WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTER THE NEXT MORNING EARLY FETNAH REPAIRED TO THE SYNDIC OF THE JEWELLERS BEING IMPATIENT TO HEAR OF GANEM'S HEALTH AND TELL THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER THE GOOD NEWS SHE HAD FOR THEM
1594-135914-0096 WHO TOLD HER THAT GANEM HAD RESTED WELL THAT NIGHT AND THAT HIS DISORDER PROCEEDING ALTOGETHER FROM MELANCHOLY THE CAUSE BEING REMOVED HE WOULD SOON RECOVER HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0097 REST AND THE GOOD MEDICINES HE HAD TAKEN BUT ABOVE ALL THE DIFFERENT SITUATION OF HIS MIND HAD WROUGHT SO GOOD AN EFFECT THAT THE SYNDIC THOUGHT HE MIGHT WITHOUT DANGER SEE HIS MOTHER HIS SISTER AND HIS MISTRESS PROVIDED HE WAS PREPARED TO RECEIVE THEM
1594-135914-0098 BECAUSE THERE WAS GROUND TO FEAR THAT NOT KNOWING HIS MOTHER AND SISTER WERE AT BAGDAD THE SIGHT OF THEM MIGHT OCCASION TOO GREAT SURPRISE AND JOY IT WAS THEREFORE RESOLVED THAT FETNAH SHOULD FIRST GO ALONE INTO GANEM'S CHAMBER
1594-135914-0099 WHEN SHE THOUGHT IT WAS PROPER MATTERS BEING SO ORDERED THE SYNDIC ANNOUNCED FETNAH'S COMING TO THE SICK MAN WHO WAS SO TRANSPORTED TO SEE HER THAT HE WAS AGAIN NEAR FAINTING AWAY WELL GANEM SAID SHE DRAWING NEAR TO HIS BED
1594-135914-0100 YOU HAVE AGAIN FOUND YOUR FETNAH WHOM YOU THOUGHT YOU HAD LOST FOR EVER
1594-135914-0101 WHAT MIRACLE HAS RESTORED YOU TO MY SIGHT
1594-135914-0102 HE HAS DOUBTLESS LISTENED TO YOU YOU HAVE DISPELLED HIS JEALOUSY AND HE HAS RESTORED YOU TO HIS FAVOUR YES MY DEAR GANEM ANSWERED FETNAH I HAVE CLEARED MYSELF BEFORE THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS WHO TO MAKE AMENDS FOR THE WRONG HE HAS DONE YOU
1594-135914-0103 BEAUTIFUL FETNAH MAY I GIVE CREDIT TO WHAT YOU TELL ME
1594-135914-0104 NOTHING IS MORE CERTAIN ANSWERED THE LADY
1594-135914-0105 WHO BEFORE CAUSED SEARCH TO BE MADE FOR YOU TO TAKE AWAY YOUR LIFE AND WHO IN HIS FURY CAUSED YOUR MOTHER AND YOUR SISTER TO SUFFER A THOUSAND INDIGNITIES DESIRES NOW TO SEE YOU THAT HE MAY REWARD THE RESPECT YOU HAD FOR HIM
1594-135914-0106 AND THERE IS NO QUESTION BUT THAT HE WILL LOAD YOUR FAMILY WITH FAVOURS
1594-135914-0107 AND HE COULD NOT FORBEAR LETTING FALL SOME TEARS AT THE RELATION NOTWITHSTANDING THE THOUGHTS WHICH AROSE IN HIS MIND AT THE PROSPECT OF BEING MARRIED TO HIS MISTRESS BUT WHEN FETNAH INFORMED HIM THAT THEY WERE ACTUALLY IN BAGDAD AND IN THE SAME HOUSE WITH HIM
1594-135914-0108 HE APPEARED SO IMPATIENT TO SEE THEM THAT THE FAVOURITE COULD NO LONGER DEFER GIVING HIM THE SATISFACTION AND ACCORDINGLY CALLED THEM IN THEY WERE AT THE DOOR WAITING FOR THAT MOMENT THEY ENTERED WENT UP TO GANEM AND EMBRACING HIM IN THEIR TURNS
1594-135914-0109 THE SYNDIC HIMSELF AND HIS WIFE WERE SO MOVED AT THE SPECTACLE THAT THEY COULD NOT FORBEAR WEEPING NOR SUFFICIENTLY ADMIRE THE SECRET WORKINGS OF PROVIDENCE WHICH HAD BROUGHT TOGETHER INTO THEIR HOUSE FOUR PERSONS WHOM FORTUNE HAD SO CRUELLY PERSECUTED
1594-135914-0110 WHEN THEY HAD DRIED UP THEIR TEARS GANEM DREW THEM AFRESH BY THE RECITAL OF WHAT HE HAD SUFFERED FROM THE DAY HE LEFT FETNAH TILL THE MOMENT THE SYNDIC BROUGHT HIM TO HIS HOUSE HE TOLD THEM THAT HAVING TAKEN REFUGE IN A SMALL VILLAGE HE THERE FELL SICK
1594-135914-0111 THAT SOME CHARITABLE PEASANTS HAD TAKEN CARE OF HIM BUT FINDING HE DID NOT RECOVER A CAMEL DRIVER HAD UNDERTAKEN TO CARRY HIM TO THE HOSPITAL AT BAGDAD
1594-135914-0112 AND HOW SHE HAD CLEARED HERSELF IN CONCLUSION WHEN THEY HAD RELATED WHAT ACCIDENTS HAD BEFALLEN THEM FETNAH SAID LET US BLESS HEAVEN WHICH HAS BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER AGAIN AND LET US THINK OF NOTHING BUT THE HAPPINESS THAT AWAITS US
1594-135914-0113 AS SOON AS GANEM HAS RECOVERED HIS HEALTH
1594-135914-0114 BUT I WILL GO AND MAKE SOME PROVISION FOR THEM THIS SAID SHE WENT TO THE PALACE AND SOON RETURNED WITH A PURSE CONTAINING A THOUSAND PIECES OF GOLD WHICH SHE DELIVERED TO THE SYNDIC DESIRING HIM TO BUY APPAREL FOR THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
1594-135914-0115 THE SYNDIC WHO WAS A MAN OF A GOOD TASTE CHOSE SUCH AS WERE VERY HANDSOME AND HAD THEM MADE UP WITH ALL EXPEDITION THEY WERE FINISHED IN THREE DAYS AND GANEM FINDING HIMSELF STRONG ENOUGH PREPARED TO GO ABROAD
1594-135914-0116 WHILE HE WAS MAKING READY WITH HIS MOTHER AND SISTER THE GRAND VIZIER JAAFFIER CAME TO THE SYNDIC'S HOUSE HE HAD COME ON HORSEBACK ATTENDED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF OFFICERS SIR SAID HE TO GANEM AS SOON AS HE ENTERED
1594-135914-0117 I AM COME FROM THE COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS MY MASTER AND YOURS THE ORDERS I HAVE DIFFER MUCH FROM THOSE WHICH I DO NOT WISH TO REVIVE IN YOUR MEMORY I AM TO BEAR YOU COMPANY
1594-135914-0118 GANEM RETURNED NO OTHER ANSWER TO THE VIZIER'S COMPLIMENT THAN BY PROFOUNDLY BOWING HIS HEAD
1594-135914-0119 WHICH HE MANAGED VERY GRACEFULLY THE MOTHER AND DAUGHTER WERE MOUNTED ON MULES BELONGING TO THE PALACE AND WHILST FETNAH ON ANOTHER MULE LED THEM BY A BYE WAY TO THE PRINCE'S COURT JAAFFIER CONDUCTED GANEM AND BROUGHT HIM INTO THE HALL OF AUDIENCE
1594-135914-0120 ARABS PERSIANS EGYPTIANS AFRICANS AND SYRIANS OF HIS OWN DOMINIONS NOT TO MENTION STRANGERS WHEN THE VIZIER HAD CONDUCTED GANEM TO THE FOOT OF THE THRONE
1594-135914-0121 I AM GLAD TO SEE YOU AND DESIRE TO HEAR FROM YOUR OWN MOUTH WHERE YOU FOUND MY FAVOURITE AND ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE FOR HER GANEM OBEYED
1594-135914-0122 AFTER WHICH HE SAID TO HIM GANEM I WILL HAVE YOU LIVE IN MY COURT COMMANDER OF THE TRUE BELIEVERS ANSWERED THE YOUNG MERCHANT A SLAVE HAS NO WILL BUT HIS MASTER'S ON WHOM HIS LIFE AND FORTUNE DEPEND
1594-135914-0123 AND ASSIGNED HIM A CONSIDERABLE PENSION HE THEN DESCENDED FROM HIS THRONE AND CAUSING ONLY GANEM AND THE GRAND VIZIER FOLLOW HIM RETIRED INTO HIS OWN APARTMENT
1594-135914-0124 NOT QUESTIONING BUT THAT FETNAH WAS IN WAITING WITH ABOU AYOUB'S WIDOW AND DAUGHTER HE CAUSED THEM TO BE CALLED IN THEY PROSTRATED THEMSELVES BEFORE HIM HE MADE THEM RISE AND WAS SO CHARMED BY JALIB AL KOOLLOOB'S BEAUTY
1594-135914-0125 THAT AFTER VIEWING HER VERY ATTENTIVELY HE SAID I AM SO SORRY FOR HAVING TREATED YOUR CHARMS SO UNWORTHILY THAT I OWE THEM SUCH A SATISFACTION AS MAY SURPASS THE INJURY I HAVE DONE I TAKE YOU TO WIFE

1594-135914-0127 I GIVE YOU TO JAAFFIER AND YOU FETNAH TO GANEM LET A CAUZEE AND WITNESSES BE CALLED AND THE THREE CONTRACTS BE DRAWN UP AND SIGNED IMMEDIATELY
1594-135914-0128 BUT HE WAS RESOLVED TO MARRY HER HAROON THOUGHT THIS SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY STORY THAT HE ORDERED HIS HISTORIOGRAPHER TO COMMIT IT TO WRITING WITH ALL ITS CIRCUMSTANCES
1624-142933-0000 PETER SEES ROSEBREAST AND FINDS REDCOAT
1624-142933-0001 WHO'S THAT PETER RABBIT PRICKED UP HIS LONG EARS AND STARED UP AT THE TOPS OF THE TREES OF THE OLD ORCHARD INSTANTLY JENNY WREN POPPED HER HEAD OUT OF HER DOORWAY SHE COCKED HER HEAD ON ONE SIDE TO LISTEN
1624-142933-0002 THEN LOOKED DOWN AT PETER AND HER SHARP LITTLE EYES SNAPPED I DON'T HEAR ANY STRANGE VOICE SAID SHE THE WAY YOU ARE STARING PETER RABBIT ONE WOULD THINK THAT YOU HAD REALLY HEARD SOMETHING NEW AND WORTH WHILE
1624-142933-0003 JUST THEN THERE WERE TWO OR THREE RATHER SHARP SQUEAKY NOTES FROM THE TOP OF ONE OF THE TREES THERE CRIED PETER THERE DIDN'T YOU HEAR THAT JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0004 FOR GOODNESS SAKE PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T MEAN TO SAY YOU DON'T KNOW WHOSE VOICE THAT IS SHE CRIED THAT'S ROSEBREAST HE AND MISSUS ROSEBREAST HAVE BEEN HERE FOR QUITE A LITTLE WHILE
1624-142933-0005 I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THERE WAS ANY ONE WHO DIDN'T KNOW THOSE SHARP SQUEAKY VOICES THEY RATHER GET ON MY NERVES WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SQUEAK LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS ROSEBREAST CAN IS MORE THAN I CAN UNDERSTAND
1624-142933-0006 AT THAT VERY INSTANT MISTER WREN BEGAN TO SCOLD AS ONLY HE AND JENNY CAN PETER LOOKED UP AT JENNY AND WINKED SLYLY AND WHAT ANYBODY WANTS TO SCOLD LIKE THAT FOR WHEN THEY CAN SING AS MISTER WREN CAN IS TOO MUCH FOR ME
1624-142933-0007 RETORTED PETER BUT YOU HAVEN'T TOLD ME WHO ROSEBREAST IS THE GROSBEAK OF COURSE STUPID SPUTTERED JENNY IF YOU DON'T KNOW ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK PETER RABBIT YOU CERTAINLY MUST HAVE BEEN BLIND AND DEAF EVER SINCE YOU WERE BORN
1624-142933-0008 LISTEN TO THAT JUST LISTEN TO THAT SONG PETER LISTENED THERE WERE MANY SONGS FOR IT WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL MORNING AND ALL THE SINGERS OF THE OLD ORCHARD WERE POURING OUT THE JOY THAT WAS WITHIN THEM
1624-142933-0009 ONE SONG WAS A LITTLE LOUDER AND CLEARER THAN THE OTHERS BECAUSE IT CAME FROM A TREE VERY CLOSE AT HAND THE VERY TREE FROM WHICH THOSE SQUEAKY NOTES HAD COME JUST A FEW MINUTES BEFORE PETER SUSPECTED THAT THAT MUST BE THE SONG JENNY WREN MEANT HE LOOKED PUZZLED
1624-142933-0010 HE WAS PUZZLED DO YOU MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG HE ASKED RATHER SHEEPISHLY FOR HE HAD A FEELING THAT HE WOULD BE THE VICTIM OF JENNY WREN'S SHARP TONGUE NO I DON'T MEAN WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG SNAPPED JENNY
1624-142933-0011 WHAT GOOD ARE A PAIR OF LONG EARS IF THEY CAN'T TELL ONE SONG FROM ANOTHER THAT SONG MAY SOUND SOMETHING LIKE WELCOME ROBIN'S BUT IF YOUR EARS WERE GOOD FOR ANYTHING AT ALL YOU'D KNOW RIGHT AWAY THAT THAT ISN'T WELCOME ROBIN SINGING
1624-142933-0012 THAT'S A BETTER SONG THAN WELCOME ROBIN'S WELCOME ROBIN'S SONG IS ONE OF GOOD CHEER BUT THIS ONE IS OF PURE HAPPINESS I WOULDN'T HAVE A PAIR OF EARS LIKE YOURS FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0013 PETER LAUGHED RIGHT OUT AS HE TRIED TO PICTURE TO HIMSELF JENNY WREN WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE HIS WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT DEMANDED JENNY CROSSLY DON'T YOU DARE LAUGH AT ME
1624-142933-0014 IF THERE IS ANY ONE THING I CAN'T STAND IT IS BEING LAUGHED AT I WASN'T LAUGHING AT YOU REPLIED PETER VERY MEEKLY I WAS JUST LAUGHING AT THE THOUGHT OF HOW FUNNY YOU WOULD LOOK WITH A PAIR OF LONG EARS LIKE MINE
1624-142933-0015 NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT JENNY THAT SONG IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM WELCOME ROBIN'S OF COURSE IT IS RETORTED JENNY THAT IS ROSEBREAST SINGING UP THERE AND THERE HE IS RIGHT IN THE TOP OF THAT TREE
1624-142933-0016 ISN'T HE HANDSOME PETER LOOKED UP TO SEE A BIRD A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS HEAD THROAT AND BACK WERE BLACK HIS WINGS WERE BLACK WITH PATCHES OF WHITE ON THEM
1624-142933-0017 BUT IT WAS HIS BREAST THAT MADE PETER CATCH HIS BREATH WITH A LITTLE GASP OF ADMIRATION FOR THAT BREAST WAS A BEAUTIFUL ROSE RED THE REST OF HIM UNDERNEATH WAS WHITE IT WAS ROSEBREAST THE GROSBEAK ISN'T HE LOVELY
1624-142933-0018 CRIED PETER AND ADDED IN THE NEXT BREATH WHO IS THAT WITH HIM MISSUS GROSBEAK OF COURSE WHO ELSE WOULD IT BE SPUTTERED JENNY RATHER CROSSLY FOR SHE WAS STILL A LITTLE PUT OUT BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN LAUGHED AT
1624-142933-0019 SAID PETER SHE DOESN'T LOOK THE LEAST BIT LIKE HIM THIS WAS QUITE TRUE THERE WAS NO BEAUTIFUL ROSE COLOR ABOUT MISSUS GROSBEAK SHE WAS DRESSED CHIEFLY IN BROWN AND GRAYISH COLORS WITH A LITTLE BUFF HERE AND THERE AND WITH DARK STREAKS ON HER BREAST
1624-142933-0020 OVER EACH EYE WAS A WHITISH LINE ALTOGETHER SHE LOOKED MORE AS IF SHE MIGHT BE A BIG MEMBER OF THE SPARROW FAMILY THAN THE WIFE OF HANDSOME ROSEBREAST
1624-142933-0021 WHILE ROSEBREAST SANG MISSUS GROSBEAK WAS VERY BUSILY PICKING BUDS AND BLOSSOMS FROM THE TREE WHAT IS SHE DOING THAT FOR INQUIRED PETER FOR THE SAME REASON THAT YOU BITE OFF SWEET CLOVER BLOSSOMS AND LEAVES
1624-142933-0022 REPLIED JENNY WREN TARTLY DO YOU MEAN TO SAY THAT THEY LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS CRIED PETER I NEVER HEARD OF SUCH A THING TUT TUT TUT TUT TUT YOU CAN ASK MORE SILLY QUESTIONS THAN ANYBODY OF MY ACQUAINTANCE RETORTED JENNY WREN
1624-142933-0023 OF COURSE THEY DON'T LIVE ON BUDS AND BLOSSOMS IF THEY DID THEY WOULD SOON STARVE TO DEATH FOR BUDS AND BLOSSOMS DON'T LAST LONG THEY EAT A FEW JUST FOR VARIETY BUT THEY LIVE MOSTLY ON BUGS AND INSECTS
1624-142933-0024 YOU ASK FARMER BROWN'S BOY WHO HELPS HIM MOST IN HIS POTATO PATCH AND HE'LL TELL YOU IT'S THE GROSBEAKS THEY CERTAINLY DO LOVE POTATO BUGS THEY EAT SOME FRUIT BUT ON THE WHOLE THEY ARE ABOUT AS USEFUL AROUND A GARDEN AS ANY ONE I KNOW
1624-142933-0025 NOW RUN ALONG PETER RABBIT AND DON'T BOTHER ME ANY MORE SEEING FARMER BROWN'S BOY COMING THROUGH THE OLD ORCHARD PETER DECIDED THAT IT WAS HIGH TIME FOR HIM TO DEPART SO HE SCAMPERED FOR THE GREEN FOREST LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP
1624-142933-0026 JUST WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST HE CAUGHT SIGHT OF SOMETHING WHICH FOR THE TIME BEING PUT ALL THOUGHT OF FARMER BROWN'S BOY OUT OF HIS HEAD FLUTTERING ON THE GROUND WAS A BIRD THAN WHOM NOT EVEN GLORY THE CARDINAL WAS MORE BEAUTIFUL
1624-142933-0027 IT WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF REDWING THE BLACKBIRD WINGS AND TAIL WERE PURE BLACK AND ALL THE REST WAS A BEAUTIFUL SCARLET IT WAS REDCOAT THE TANAGER AT FIRST PETER HAD EYES ONLY FOR THE WONDERFUL BEAUTY OF REDCOAT
1624-142933-0028 NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SEEN REDCOAT SO CLOSE AT HAND THEN QUITE SUDDENLY IT CAME OVER PETER THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH REDCOAT AND HE HURRIED FORWARD TO SEE WHAT THE TROUBLE MIGHT BE REDCOAT HEARD THE RUSTLE OF PETER'S FEET AMONG THE DRY LEAVES
1624-142933-0029 BUT HE COULD NOT GET OFF THE GROUND WHAT IS IT REDCOAT HAS SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU IT IS JUST PETER RABBIT YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO FEAR FROM ME CRIED PETER THE LOOK OF TERROR WHICH HAD BEEN IN THE EYES OF REDCOAT DIED OUT
1624-142933-0030 AND HE STOPPED FLUTTERING AND SIMPLY LAY PANTING OH PETER HE GASPED YOU DON'T KNOW HOW GLAD I AM THAT IT IS ONLY YOU I'VE HAD A TERRIBLE ACCIDENT AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT I AM TO DO
1624-142933-0031 I CAN'T FLY AND IF I HAVE TO STAY ON THE GROUND SOME ENEMY WILL BE SURE TO GET ME WHAT SHALL I DO PETER WHAT SHALL I DO RIGHT AWAY PETER WAS FULL OF SYMPATHY
1624-142933-0032 WHAT KIND OF AN ACCIDENT WAS IT REDCOAT AND HOW DID IT HAPPEN HE ASKED BROADWING THE HAWK TRIED TO CATCH ME
1624-142933-0033 AND DID NOT SEE JUST WHERE I WAS GOING I STRUCK A SHARP POINTED DEAD TWIG AND DROVE IT RIGHT THROUGH MY RIGHT WING REDCOAT HELD UP HIS RIGHT WING AND SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A LITTLE STICK PROJECTING FROM BOTH SIDES CLOSE UP TO THE SHOULDER
1624-142933-0034 THE WING WAS BLEEDING A LITTLE OH DEAR WHATEVER SHALL I DO PETER RABBIT
1624-142933-0035 SOBBED REDCOAT DOES IT PAIN YOU DREADFULLY ASKED PETER REDCOAT NODDED BUT I DON'T MIND THE PAIN HE HASTENED TO SAY IT IS THE THOUGHT OF WHAT MAY HAPPEN TO ME
1624-142933-0036 POOR REDCOAT WITH THE OLD LOOK OF TERROR IN HIS EYES FLUTTERED ALONG TRYING TO FIND SOMETHING UNDER WHICH TO HIDE BUT THERE WAS NOTHING UNDER WHICH HE COULD CRAWL AND THERE WAS NO HIDING THAT WONDERFUL RED COAT
1624-142933-0037 PETER HEARD THE SOUND OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS AND LOOKING BACK SAW THAT FARMER BROWN'S BOY WAS COMING DON'T BE AFRAID REDCOAT HE WHISPERED IT'S FARMER BROWN'S BOY AND I'M SURE HE WON'T HURT YOU PERHAPS HE CAN HELP YOU
1624-142933-0038 THEN PETER SCAMPERED OFF FOR A SHORT DISTANCE AND SAT UP TO WATCH WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
1624-142933-0039 NO ONE WITH ANY EYES AT ALL COULD HAVE HELPED SEEING HIM BECAUSE OF THAT WONDERFUL SCARLET COAT HE SAW TOO BY THE WAY REDCOAT WAS ACTING THAT HE WAS IN GREAT TROUBLE AS FARMER BROWN'S BOY DREW NEAR AND REDCOAT SAW THAT HE WAS DISCOVERED
1624-142933-0040 HE TRIED HIS HARDEST TO FLUTTER AWAY FARMER BROWN'S BOY UNDERSTOOD INSTANTLY THAT SOMETHING WAS WRONG WITH ONE WING AND RUNNING FORWARD HE CAUGHT REDCOAT YOU POOR LITTLE THING
1624-142933-0041 SAID FARMER BROWN'S BOY SOFTLY AS HE SAW THE CRUEL TWIG STICKING THROUGH REDCOATS SHOULDER
1624-142933-0042 CONTINUED FARMER BROWN'S BOY STROKING REDCOAT EVER SO GENTLY SOMEHOW AT THAT GENTLE TOUCH REDCOAT LOST MUCH OF HIS FEAR AND A LITTLE HOPE SPRANG IN HIS HEART
1624-142933-0043 FARMER BROWN'S BOY TOOK OUT HIS KNIFE AND CAREFULLY CUT OFF THE TWIG ON THE UPPER SIDE OF THE WING THEN DOING HIS BEST TO BE CAREFUL AND TO HURT AS LITTLE AS POSSIBLE HE WORKED THE OTHER PART OF THE TWIG OUT FROM THE UNDER SIDE
1624-142933-0044 CAREFULLY HE EXAMINED THE WING TO SEE IF ANY BONES WERE BROKEN NONE WERE AND AFTER HOLDING REDCOAT A FEW MINUTES HE CAREFULLY SET HIM UP IN A TREE AND WITHDREW A SHORT DISTANCE REDCOAT HOPPED FROM BRANCH TO BRANCH
1624-142933-0045 UNTIL HE WAS HALFWAY UP THE TREE THEN HE SAT THERE FOR SOME TIME AS IF FEARFUL OF TRYING THAT INJURED WING MEANWHILE MISSUS TANAGER CAME AND FUSSED ABOUT HIM AND TALKED TO HIM AND COAXED HIM AND MADE AS MUCH OF HIM AS IF HE WERE A BABY
1624-142933-0046 FROM TREE TO TREE HE FLEW
1624-168623-0000 THE MOMENT HAS ARRIVED FOR MAKING THE CIRCUIT OF THIS COUPLE AND CONSIDERING IT UNDER ALL ITS ASPECTS THENARDIER HAD JUST PASSED HIS FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY MADAME THENARDIER WAS APPROACHING HER FORTIES WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO FIFTY IN A WOMAN
1624-168623-0001 SO THAT THERE EXISTED A BALANCE OF AGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE OUR READERS HAVE POSSIBLY PRESERVED SOME RECOLLECTION OF THIS THENARDIER WOMAN EVER SINCE HER FIRST APPEARANCE TALL BLOND RED FAT ANGULAR SQUARE
1624-168623-0002 ENORMOUS AND AGILE SHE BELONGED AS WE HAVE SAID TO THE RACE OF THOSE COLOSSAL WILD WOMEN WHO CONTORT THEMSELVES AT FAIRS WITH PAVING STONES HANGING FROM THEIR HAIR SHE DID EVERYTHING ABOUT THE HOUSE
1624-168623-0003 MADE THE BEDS DID THE WASHING THE COOKING AND EVERYTHING ELSE COSETTE WAS HER ONLY SERVANT A MOUSE IN THE SERVICE OF AN ELEPHANT EVERYTHING TREMBLED AT THE SOUND OF HER VOICE WINDOW PANES FURNITURE AND PEOPLE
1624-168623-0004 HER BIG FACE DOTTED WITH RED BLOTCHES PRESENTED THE APPEARANCE OF A SKIMMER SHE HAD A BEARD SHE WAS AN IDEAL MARKET PORTER DRESSED IN WOMAN'S CLOTHES SHE SWORE SPLENDIDLY
1624-168623-0005 SHE BOASTED OF BEING ABLE TO CRACK A NUT WITH ONE BLOW OF HER FIST EXCEPT FOR THE ROMANCES WHICH SHE HAD READ AND WHICH MADE THE AFFECTED LADY PEEP THROUGH THE OGRESS AT TIMES IN A VERY QUEER WAY THE IDEA WOULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED TO ANY ONE TO SAY OF HER
1624-168623-0006 THAT IS A WOMAN THIS THENARDIER FEMALE WAS LIKE THE PRODUCT OF A WENCH ENGRAFTED ON A FISHWIFE WHEN ONE HEARD HER SPEAK ONE SAID THAT IS A GENDARME WHEN ONE SAW HER DRINK ONE SAID THAT IS A CARTER
1624-168623-0007 WHEN ONE SAW HER HANDLE COSETTE ONE SAID THAT IS THE HANGMAN ONE OF HER TEETH PROJECTED WHEN HER FACE WAS IN REPOSE THENARDIER WAS A SMALL THIN PALE ANGULAR BONY FEEBLE MAN
1624-168623-0008 HIS CUNNING BEGAN HERE HE SMILED HABITUALLY BY WAY OF PRECAUTION AND WAS ALMOST POLITE TO EVERYBODY EVEN TO THE BEGGAR TO WHOM HE REFUSED HALF A FARTHING HE HAD THE GLANCE OF A POLE CAT AND THE BEARING OF A MAN OF LETTERS
1624-168623-0009 HE GREATLY RESEMBLED THE PORTRAITS OF THE ABBE DELILLE HIS COQUETRY CONSISTED IN DRINKING WITH THE CARTERS NO ONE HAD EVER SUCCEEDED IN RENDERING HIM DRUNK HE SMOKED A BIG PIPE
1624-168623-0010 HE WORE A BLOUSE AND UNDER HIS BLOUSE AN OLD BLACK COAT HE MADE PRETENSIONS TO LITERATURE AND TO MATERIALISM THERE WERE CERTAIN NAMES WHICH HE OFTEN PRONOUNCED TO SUPPORT WHATEVER THINGS HE MIGHT BE SAYING VOLTAIRE
1624-168623-0011 HE DECLARED THAT HE HAD A SYSTEM IN ADDITION HE WAS A GREAT SWINDLER
1624-168623-0012 THE SPECIES DOES EXIST IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT HE PRETENDED TO HAVE SERVED IN THE ARMY HE WAS IN THE HABIT OF RELATING WITH EXUBERANCE HOW BEING A SERGEANT IN THE SIXTH OR THE NINTH LIGHT SOMETHING OR OTHER AT WATERLOO
1624-168623-0013 HE HAD ALONE AND IN THE PRESENCE OF A SQUADRON OF DEATH DEALING HUSSARS COVERED WITH HIS BODY AND SAVED FROM DEATH IN THE MIDST OF THE GRAPE SHOT A GENERAL WHO HAD BEEN DANGEROUSLY WOUNDED
1624-168623-0014 THENCE AROSE FOR HIS WALL THE FLARING SIGN AND FOR HIS INN THE NAME WHICH IT BORE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THE CABARET OF THE SERGEANT OF WATERLOO HE WAS A LIBERAL A CLASSIC AND A BONAPARTIST
1624-168623-0015 WE BELIEVE THAT HE HAD SIMPLY STUDIED IN HOLLAND FOR AN INN KEEPER THIS RASCAL OF COMPOSITE ORDER WAS IN ALL PROBABILITY SOME FLEMING FROM LILLE IN FLANDERS A FRENCHMAN IN PARIS A BELGIAN AT BRUSSELS
1624-168623-0016 BEING COMFORTABLY ASTRIDE OF BOTH FRONTIERS AS FOR HIS PROWESS AT WATERLOO THE READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED WITH THAT IT WILL BE PERCEIVED THAT HE EXAGGERATED IT A TRIFLE EBB AND FLOW
1624-168623-0017 A TATTERED CONSCIENCE ENTAILS A FRAGMENTARY LIFE AND APPARENTLY AT THE STORMY EPOCH OF JUNE EIGHTEENTH EIGHTEEN FIFTEEN THENARDIER BELONGED TO THAT VARIETY OF MARAUDING SUTLERS OF WHICH WE HAVE SPOKEN
1624-168623-0018 BEATING ABOUT THE COUNTRY SELLING TO SOME STEALING FROM OTHERS AND TRAVELLING LIKE A FAMILY MAN WITH WIFE AND CHILDREN IN A RICKETY CART IN THE REAR OF TROOPS ON THE MARCH WITH AN INSTINCT FOR ALWAYS ATTACHING HIMSELF TO THE VICTORIOUS ARMY
1624-168623-0019 THIS CAMPAIGN ENDED AND HAVING AS HE SAID
1624-168623-0020 OF GOLD RINGS AND SILVER CROSSES GATHERED IN HARVEST TIME IN FURROWS SOWN WITH CORPSES DID NOT AMOUNT TO A LARGE TOTAL AND DID NOT CARRY THIS SUTLER TURNED EATING HOUSE KEEPER VERY FAR
1624-168623-0021 ACCOMPANIED BY AN OATH RECALLS THE BARRACKS AND BY A SIGN OF THE CROSS THE SEMINARY HE WAS A FINE TALKER HE ALLOWED IT TO BE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS AN EDUCATED MAN
1624-168623-0022 BUT PRACTISED EYES SOMETIMES SPIED OUT ORTHOGRAPHICAL ERRORS IN IT THENARDIER WAS CUNNING GREEDY SLOTHFUL AND CLEVER HE DID NOT DISDAIN HIS SERVANTS WHICH CAUSED HIS WIFE TO DISPENSE WITH THEM
1624-168623-0023 THIS GIANTESS WAS JEALOUS IT SEEMED TO HER THAT THAT THIN AND YELLOW LITTLE MAN MUST BE AN OBJECT COVETED BY ALL THENARDIER WHO WAS ABOVE ALL AN ASTUTE AND WELL BALANCED MAN WAS A SCAMP OF A TEMPERATE SORT
1624-168623-0024 THIS IS THE WORST SPECIES HYPOCRISY ENTERS INTO IT IT IS NOT THAT THENARDIER WAS NOT ON OCCASION CAPABLE OF WRATH TO QUITE THE SAME DEGREE AS HIS WIFE BUT THIS WAS VERY RARE
1624-168623-0025 AND AT SUCH TIMES SINCE HE WAS ENRAGED WITH THE HUMAN RACE IN GENERAL AS HE BORE WITHIN HIM A DEEP FURNACE OF HATRED AND SINCE HE WAS ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE CONTINUALLY AVENGING THEIR WRONGS
1624-168623-0026 WHO ACCUSE EVERYTHING THAT PASSES BEFORE THEM OF EVERYTHING WHICH HAS BEFALLEN THEM AND WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO CAST UPON THE FIRST PERSON WHO COMES TO HAND AS A LEGITIMATE GRIEVANCE THE SUM TOTAL OF THE DECEPTIONS THE BANKRUPTCIES AND THE CALAMITIES OF THEIR LIVES
1624-168623-0027 WHEN ALL THIS LEAVEN WAS STIRRED UP IN HIM AND BOILED FORTH FROM HIS MOUTH AND EYES HE WAS TERRIBLE WOE TO THE PERSON WHO CAME UNDER HIS WRATH AT SUCH A TIME IN ADDITION TO HIS OTHER QUALITIES THENARDIER WAS ATTENTIVE AND PENETRATING
1624-168623-0028 SILENT OR TALKATIVE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES AND ALWAYS HIGHLY INTELLIGENT HE HAD SOMETHING OF THE LOOK OF SAILORS WHO ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SCREW UP THEIR EYES TO GAZE THROUGH MARINE GLASSES THENARDIER WAS A STATESMAN
1624-168623-0029 EVERY NEW COMER WHO ENTERED THE TAVERN SAID ON CATCHING SIGHT OF MADAME THENARDIER THERE IS THE MASTER OF THE HOUSE A MISTAKE SHE WAS NOT EVEN THE MISTRESS THE HUSBAND WAS BOTH MASTER AND MISTRESS
1624-168623-0030 SHE WORKED HE CREATED HE DIRECTED EVERYTHING BY A SORT OF INVISIBLE AND CONSTANT MAGNETIC ACTION A WORD WAS SUFFICIENT FOR HIM SOMETIMES A SIGN THE MASTODON OBEYED
1624-168623-0031 THOUGH SHE DID NOT THOROUGHLY REALIZE IT SHE WAS POSSESSED OF VIRTUES AFTER HER OWN KIND IF SHE HAD EVER HAD A DISAGREEMENT AS TO ANY DETAIL WITH
1624-168623-0032 WHICH WAS AN INADMISSIBLE HYPOTHESIS BY THE WAY SHE WOULD NOT HAVE BLAMED HER HUSBAND IN PUBLIC ON ANY SUBJECT WHATEVER SHE WOULD NEVER HAVE COMMITTED BEFORE STRANGERS THAT
1624-168623-0033 EXPOSING THE CROWN ALTHOUGH THEIR CONCORD HAD ONLY EVIL AS ITS RESULT
1624-168623-0034 VIEWED ON ITS DWARFED AND GROTESQUE SIDE THIS WAS THAT GRAND AND UNIVERSAL THING THE ADORATION OF MIND BY MATTER FOR CERTAIN UGLY FEATURES HAVE A CAUSE IN THE VERY DEPTHS OF ETERNAL BEAUTY
1624-168623-0035 HENCE THE ABSOLUTE EMPIRE OF THE MAN OVER THAT WOMAN AT CERTAIN MOMENTS SHE BEHELD HIM LIKE A LIGHTED CANDLE AT OTHERS SHE FELT HIM LIKE A CLAW THIS WOMAN WAS A FORMIDABLE CREATURE WHO LOVED NO ONE EXCEPT HER CHILDREN
1624-168623-0036 AND WHO DID NOT FEAR ANY ONE EXCEPT HER HUSBAND SHE WAS A MOTHER BECAUSE SHE WAS MAMMIFEROUS BUT HER MATERNITY STOPPED SHORT WITH HER DAUGHTERS AND AS WE SHALL SEE DID NOT EXTEND TO BOYS THE MAN HAD BUT ONE THOUGHT HOW TO ENRICH HIMSELF
1624-168623-0037 A THEATRE WORTHY OF THIS GREAT TALENT WAS LACKING
1624-168623-0038 IF RUIN IS POSSIBLE TO ZERO IN SWITZERLAND OR IN THE PYRENEES THIS PENNILESS SCAMP WOULD HAVE BECOME A MILLIONAIRE BUT AN INN KEEPER MUST BROWSE WHERE FATE HAS HITCHED HIM
1624-168623-0039 IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE WORD INN KEEPER IS HERE EMPLOYED IN A RESTRICTED SENSE AND DOES NOT EXTEND TO AN ENTIRE CLASS IN THIS SAME YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY THREE
1624-168623-0040 THENARDIER WAS BURDENED WITH ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FRANCS WORTH OF PETTY DEBTS AND THIS RENDERED HIM ANXIOUS WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN THE OBSTINATE INJUSTICE OF DESTINY IN THIS CASE THENARDIER WAS ONE OF THOSE MEN WHO UNDERSTAND BEST
1624-168623-0041 WITH THE MOST PROFUNDITY AND IN THE MOST MODERN FASHION THAT THING WHICH IS A VIRTUE AMONG BARBAROUS PEOPLES AND AN OBJECT OF MERCHANDISE AMONG CIVILIZED PEOPLES HOSPITALITY BESIDES HE WAS AN ADMIRABLE POACHER
1624-168623-0042 AND QUOTED FOR HIS SKILL IN SHOOTING HE HAD A CERTAIN COLD AND TRANQUIL LAUGH WHICH WAS PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS HIS THEORIES AS A LANDLORD SOMETIMES BURST FORTH IN LIGHTNING FLASHES
1624-168623-0043 HE HAD PROFESSIONAL APHORISMS WHICH HE INSERTED INTO HIS WIFE'S MIND THE DUTY OF THE INN KEEPER
1624-168623-0044 AND A SMILE TO STOP PASSERS BY TO EMPTY SMALL PURSES AND TO HONESTLY LIGHTEN HEAVY ONES TO SHELTER TRAVELLING FAMILIES RESPECTFULLY
1624-168623-0045 TO SHAVE THE MAN TO PLUCK THE WOMAN TO PICK THE CHILD CLEAN TO QUOTE THE WINDOW OPEN THE WINDOW SHUT THE CHIMNEY CORNER THE ARM CHAIR THE CHAIR THE OTTOMAN THE STOOL THE FEATHER BED THE MATTRESS AND THE TRUSS OF STRAW
1624-168623-0046 TO KNOW HOW MUCH THE SHADOW USES UP THE MIRROR AND TO PUT A PRICE ON IT AND BY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DEVILS TO MAKE THE TRAVELLER PAY FOR EVERYTHING
1624-168623-0047 THIS MAN AND THIS WOMAN WERE RUSE AND RAGE WEDDED A HIDEOUS AND TERRIBLE TEAM WHILE THE HUSBAND PONDERED AND COMBINED MADAME THENARDIER THOUGHT NOT OF ABSENT CREDITORS
1624-168623-0048 TOOK NO HEED OF YESTERDAY NOR OF TO MORROW AND LIVED IN A FIT OF ANGER ALL IN A MINUTE SUCH WERE THESE TWO BEINGS COSETTE WAS BETWEEN THEM SUBJECTED TO THEIR DOUBLE PRESSURE
1624-168623-0049 THE MAN AND THE WOMAN EACH HAD A DIFFERENT METHOD COSETTE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH BLOWS THIS WAS THE WOMAN'S SHE WENT BAREFOOTED IN WINTER THAT WAS THE MAN'S DOING
1624-168623-0050 COSETTE RAN UP STAIRS AND DOWN WASHED SWEPT RUBBED DUSTED RAN FLUTTERED ABOUT PANTED MOVED HEAVY ARTICLES AND WEAK AS SHE WAS DID THE COARSE WORK THERE WAS NO MERCY FOR HER
1624-168623-0051 A FIERCE MISTRESS AND VENOMOUS MASTER THE THENARDIER HOSTELRY WAS LIKE A SPIDER'S WEB IN WHICH COSETTE HAD BEEN CAUGHT AND WHERE SHE LAY TREMBLING THE IDEAL OF OPPRESSION WAS REALIZED BY THIS SINISTER HOUSEHOLD
1624-168623-0052 IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THE FLY SERVING THE SPIDERS THE POOR CHILD PASSIVELY HELD HER PEACE WHAT TAKES PLACE WITHIN THESE SOULS WHEN THEY HAVE BUT JUST QUITTED GOD FIND THEMSELVES THUS
1624-168623-0053 AT THE VERY DAWN OF LIFE VERY SMALL
163-121908-0000 SHE CEASED AND WAS ABOUT TO PASS ON IN HER DISCOURSE TO THE EXPOSITION OF OTHER MATTERS WHEN I BREAK IN AND SAY EXCELLENT IS THINE EXHORTATION AND SUCH AS WELL BESEEMETH THY HIGH AUTHORITY
163-121908-0001 AT ALL AND IF SO WHAT IT IS THEN SHE MADE ANSWER I AM ANXIOUS TO FULFIL MY PROMISE COMPLETELY AND OPEN TO THEE A WAY OF RETURN TO THY NATIVE LAND
163-121908-0002 WHAT PLACE CAN BE LEFT FOR RANDOM ACTION WHEN GOD CONSTRAINETH ALL THINGS TO ORDER FOR EX NIHILO NIHIL IS SOUND DOCTRINE WHICH NONE OF THE ANCIENTS GAINSAID
163-121908-0003 ALTHOUGH THEY USED IT OF MATERIAL SUBSTANCE NOT OF THE EFFICIENT PRINCIPLE THIS THEY LAID DOWN AS A KIND OF BASIS FOR ALL THEIR REASONINGS CONCERNING NATURE NOW
163-121908-0004 OUR GOOD ARISTOTLE SAYS SHE HAS DEFINED IT CONCISELY IN HIS PHYSICS AND CLOSELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRUTH HOW PRAY SAID I
163-121908-0005 FOR INSTANCE IF A MAN IS DIGGING THE EARTH FOR TILLAGE AND FINDS A MASS OF BURIED GOLD NOW SUCH A FIND IS REGARDED AS ACCIDENTAL YET IT IS NOT
163-121908-0006 EX NIHILO FOR IT HAS ITS PROPER CAUSES THE UNFORESEEN AND UNEXPECTED CONCURRENCE OF WHICH HAS BROUGHT THE CHANCE ABOUT FOR HAD NOT THE CULTIVATOR BEEN DIGGING
163-121908-0007 HAD NOT THE MAN WHO HID THE MONEY BURIED IT IN THAT PRECISE SPOT THE GOLD WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN FOUND THESE THEN ARE THE REASONS WHY THE FIND IS A CHANCE ONE IN THAT IT RESULTS FROM CAUSES WHICH MET TOGETHER AND CONCURRED
163-121908-0008 NOT FROM ANY INTENTION ON THE PART OF THE DISCOVERER SINCE NEITHER HE WHO BURIED THE GOLD NOR HE WHO WORKED IN THE FIELD INTENDED THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE FOUND BUT AS I SAID IT HAPPENED
163-121908-0009 BY COINCIDENCE THAT ONE DUG WHERE THE OTHER BURIED THE TREASURE WE MAY THEN DEFINE CHANCE AS BEING AN UNEXPECTED RESULT FLOWING FROM A CONCURRENCE OF CAUSES WHERE THE SEVERAL FACTORS HAD SOME DEFINITE END
163-121908-0010 BUT THE MEETING AND CONCURRENCE OF THESE CAUSES ARISES FROM THAT INEVITABLE CHAIN OF ORDER WHICH FLOWING FROM THE FOUNTAIN HEAD OF PROVIDENCE DISPOSES ALL THINGS IN THEIR DUE TIME AND PLACE
163-121908-0011 SOON TO DRAW APART AND PLAINWARD EACH ITS SEPARATE WAY TO WEND WHEN ONCE MORE THEIR WATERS MINGLE IN A CHANNEL
163-121908-0012 DEEP AND WIDE ALL THE FLOTSAM COMES TOGETHER THAT IS BORNE UPON THE TIDE SHIPS AND TRUNKS OF TREES UPROOTED IN THE TORRENT'S WILD CAREER MEET AS MID THE SWIRLING WATERS
163-122947-0000 CHAPTER SEVEN OUR VIRTUES
163-122947-0001 OUR VIRTUES IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE TOO HAVE STILL OUR VIRTUES ALTHOUGH NATURALLY THEY ARE NOT THOSE SINCERE AND MASSIVE VIRTUES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH WE HOLD OUR GRANDFATHERS IN ESTEEM
163-122947-0002 AND ALSO AT A LITTLE DISTANCE FROM US WE EUROPEANS OF THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW WE FIRSTLINGS OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY WITH ALL OUR DANGEROUS CURIOSITY OUR MULTIFARIOUSNESS AND ART OF DISGUISING
163-122947-0003 WITH OUR MOST ARDENT REQUIREMENTS WELL THEN LET US LOOK FOR THEM IN OUR LABYRINTHS WHERE AS WE KNOW SO MANY THINGS LOSE THEMSELVES SO MANY THINGS GET QUITE LOST
163-122947-0004 AND IS THERE ANYTHING FINER THAN TO SEARCH FOR ONE'S OWN VIRTUES IS IT NOT ALMOST TO BELIEVE IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES BUT THIS BELIEVING IN ONE'S OWN VIRTUES
163-122947-0005 IT WILL BE DIFFERENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN AS IN THE STELLAR FIRMAMENT THERE ARE SOMETIMES TWO SUNS WHICH DETERMINE THE PATH OF ONE PLANET
163-122947-0006 NOW WITH RED LIGHT NOW WITH GREEN
163-122947-0007 SO WE MODERN MEN OWING TO THE COMPLICATED MECHANISM OF OUR FIRMAMENT ARE DETERMINED BY DIFFERENT MORALITIES
163-122947-0008 AND ARE SELDOM UNEQUIVOCAL AND THERE ARE OFTEN CASES ALSO IN WHICH OUR ACTIONS ARE MOTLEY COLOURED
163-122947-0009 INDEED AT TIMES THE HIGHER AND SUBLIMER THING TAKES PLACE WE LEARN TO DESPISE WHEN WE LOVE AND PRECISELY WHEN WE LOVE BEST ALL OF IT HOWEVER UNCONSCIOUSLY WITHOUT NOISE
163-122947-0010 IS OPPOSED TO OUR TASTE NOWADAYS THIS IS ALSO AN ADVANCE AS IT WAS AN ADVANCE IN OUR FATHERS THAT RELIGION AS AN ATTITUDE FINALLY BECAME OPPOSED TO THEIR TASTE INCLUDING THE ENMITY
163-122947-0011 AND VOLTAIREAN BITTERNESS AGAINST RELIGION AND ALL THAT FORMERLY BELONGED TO FREETHINKER PANTOMIME IT IS THE MUSIC IN OUR CONSCIENCE THE DANCE IN OUR SPIRIT TO WHICH PURITAN LITANIES
163-122947-0012 MORAL SERMONS AND GOODY GOODNESS WON'T CHIME
163-122947-0013 LET US BE CAREFUL IN DEALING WITH THOSE WHO ATTACH GREAT IMPORTANCE TO BEING CREDITED WITH MORAL TACT AND SUBTLETY IN MORAL DISCERNMENT THEY NEVER FORGIVE US IF THEY HAVE ONCE MADE A MISTAKE BEFORE US
163-122947-0014 FOR THEY GET THE BETTER EVEN OF THEIR BLUNDERS
163-122947-0015 JUST AS THOUGH IN SHORT THEY BETRAY SOMETHING THEREBY FLAUBERT FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0016 I WOULD NOW RECOMMEND FOR A CHANGE SOMETHING ELSE FOR A PLEASURE NAMELY THE UNCONSCIOUS ASTUTENESS WITH WHICH GOOD FAT HONEST MEDIOCRITY ALWAYS BEHAVES TOWARDS LOFTIER SPIRITS
163-122947-0017 SUBTLER EVEN THAN THE UNDERSTANDING OF ITS VICTIMS A REPEATED PROOF THAT INSTINCT IS THE MOST INTELLIGENT OF ALL KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE WHICH HAVE HITHERTO BEEN DISCOVERED
163-122947-0018 TWO HUNDRED NINETEEN THE PRACTICE OF JUDGING AND CONDEMNING MORALLY IS THE FAVOURITE REVENGE OF THE INTELLECTUALLY SHALLOW ON THOSE WHO ARE LESS SO
163-122947-0019 IT IS ALSO A KIND OF INDEMNITY FOR THEIR BEING BADLY ENDOWED BY NATURE AND FINALLY IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ACQUIRING SPIRIT AND BECOMING SUBTLE
163-122947-0020 MALICE SPIRITUALISES THEY ARE GLAD IN THEIR INMOST HEART THAT THERE IS A STANDARD ACCORDING TO WHICH THOSE WHO ARE OVER ENDOWED WITH INTELLECTUAL GOODS AND PRIVILEGES ARE EQUAL TO THEM
163-122947-0021 I SHALL TAKE CARE NOT TO SAY SO I WOULD RATHER FLATTER THEM WITH MY THEORY THAT LOFTY SPIRITUALITY ITSELF EXISTS ONLY AS THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT OF MORAL QUALITIES
163-122947-0022 IS PRECISELY THE SPIRITUALISING OF JUSTICE
163-122947-0023 GRADATIONS OF RANK IN THE WORLD EVEN AMONG THINGS AND NOT ONLY AMONG MEN
163-122947-0024 AND WHAT ARE THE THINGS GENERALLY WHICH FUNDAMENTALLY AND PROFOUNDLY CONCERN ORDINARY MEN INCLUDING THE CULTURED EVEN THE LEARNED AND PERHAPS PHILOSOPHERS ALSO IF APPEARANCES DO NOT DECEIVE
163-122947-0025 THE FACT THEREBY BECOMES OBVIOUS THAT THE GREATER PART OF WHAT INTERESTS AND CHARMS HIGHER NATURES AND MORE REFINED AND FASTIDIOUS TASTES SEEMS ABSOLUTELY UNINTERESTING TO THE AVERAGE MAN IF
163-122947-0026 NOTWITHSTANDING HE PERCEIVE DEVOTION TO THESE INTERESTS HE CALLS IT DESINTERESSE AND WONDERS HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO ACT DISINTERESTEDLY THERE HAVE BEEN PHILOSOPHERS
163-122947-0027 WHO COULD GIVE THIS POPULAR ASTONISHMENT A SEDUCTIVE AND MYSTICAL OTHER WORLDLY EXPRESSION PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY DID NOT KNOW THE HIGHER NATURE BY EXPERIENCE INSTEAD OF STATING
163-122947-0028 EVEN AN ACTION FOR LOVE'S SAKE SHALL BE UNEGOISTIC BUT YOU FOOLS AND THE PRAISE OF THE SELF SACRIFICER BUT WHOEVER HAS REALLY OFFERED SACRIFICE KNOWS
163-122947-0029 THAT HE WANTED AND OBTAINED SOMETHING FOR IT PERHAPS SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF FOR SOMETHING FROM HIMSELF THAT HE RELINQUISHED HERE IN ORDER TO HAVE MORE THERE PERHAPS IN GENERAL TO BE MORE
163-122947-0030 THAT I HONOUR AND RESPECT AN UNSELFISH MAN NOT HOWEVER BECAUSE HE IS UNSELFISH BUT BECAUSE I THINK HE HAS A RIGHT TO BE USEFUL TO ANOTHER MAN AT HIS OWN EXPENSE IN SHORT THE QUESTION IS ALWAYS
163-122947-0031 AND WHO THE OTHER IS FOR INSTANCE IN A PERSON CREATED AND DESTINED FOR COMMAND SELF DENIAL AND MODEST RETIREMENT INSTEAD OF BEING VIRTUES WOULD BE THE WASTE OF VIRTUES
163-122947-0032 SO IT SEEMS TO ME EVERY SYSTEM OF UNEGOISTIC MORALITY WHICH TAKES ITSELF UNCONDITIONALLY AND APPEALS TO EVERY ONE NOT ONLY SINS AGAINST GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0033 BUT IS ALSO AN INCENTIVE TO SINS OF OMISSION AN ADDITIONAL SEDUCTION UNDER THE MASK OF PHILANTHROPY AND PRECISELY A SEDUCTION AND INJURY TO THE HIGHER RARER AND MORE PRIVILEGED TYPES OF MEN
163-122947-0034 MORAL SYSTEMS MUST BE COMPELLED FIRST OF ALL TO BOW BEFORE THE GRADATIONS OF RANK THEIR PRESUMPTION MUST BE DRIVEN HOME TO THEIR CONSCIENCE UNTIL THEY THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND AT LAST
163-122947-0035 THAT IT IS IMMORAL TO SAY THAT WHAT IS RIGHT FOR ONE IS PROPER FOR ANOTHER SO SAID MY MORALISTIC PEDANT AND BONHOMME
163-122947-0036 DID HE PERHAPS DESERVE TO BE LAUGHED AT WHEN HE THUS EXHORTED SYSTEMS OF MORALS TO PRACTISE MORALITY BUT ONE SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH IN THE RIGHT
163-122947-0037 FELLOW SUFFERING IS PREACHED NOWADAYS AND IF I GATHER RIGHTLY NO OTHER RELIGION IS ANY LONGER PREACHED LET THE PSYCHOLOGIST HAVE HIS EARS OPEN THROUGH ALL THE VANITY THROUGH ALL THE NOISE WHICH IS NATURAL TO THESE PREACHERS
163-122947-0038 AS TO ALL PREACHERS HE WILL HEAR A HOARSE GROANING GENUINE NOTE OF SELF CONTEMPT IT BELONGS TO THE OVERSHADOWING AND UGLIFYING OF EUROPE WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE INCREASE FOR A CENTURY
163-122947-0039 THE FIRST SYMPTOMS OF WHICH ARE ALREADY SPECIFIED DOCUMENTARILY IN A THOUGHTFUL LETTER OF GALIANI TO MADAME D'EPINAY IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF THE MAN OF MODERN IDEAS
163-122947-0040 THE HYBRID EUROPEAN A TOLERABLY UGLY PLEBEIAN TAKEN ALL IN ALL ABSOLUTELY REQUIRES A COSTUME HE NEEDS HISTORY AS A STOREROOM OF COSTUMES
163-122947-0041 TO BE SURE HE NOTICES THAT NONE OF THE COSTUMES FIT HIM PROPERLY HE CHANGES AND CHANGES LET US LOOK AT THE NINETEENTH CENTURY WITH RESPECT TO THESE HASTY PREFERENCES AND CHANGES IN ITS MASQUERADES OF STYLE
163-122947-0042 AND ALSO WITH RESPECT TO ITS MOMENTS OF DESPERATION ON ACCOUNT OF NOTHING SUITING US IT IS IN VAIN TO GET OURSELVES UP AS ROMANTIC OR CLASSICAL OR CHRISTIAN
163-122947-0043 OR FLORENTINE OR BAROCCO OR NATIONAL IN MORIBUS ET ARTIBUS IT DOES NOT CLOTHE US BUT THE SPIRIT ESPECIALLY THE
163-122947-0044 HISTORICAL SPIRIT PROFITS EVEN BY THIS DESPERATION ONCE AND AGAIN A NEW SAMPLE OF THE PAST OR OF THE FOREIGN IS TESTED PUT ON TAKEN OFF PACKED UP AND ABOVE ALL STUDIED
163-122947-0045 WE ARE PREPARED AS NO OTHER AGE HAS EVER BEEN FOR A CARNIVAL IN THE GRAND STYLE FOR THE MOST SPIRITUAL FESTIVAL LAUGHTER AND ARROGANCE FOR THE TRANSCENDENTAL HEIGHT OF SUPREME FOLLY
163-122947-0046 AND ARISTOPHANIC RIDICULE OF THE WORLD PERHAPS WE ARE STILL DISCOVERING THE DOMAIN OF OUR INVENTION JUST HERE THE DOMAIN WHERE EVEN WE CAN STILL BE ORIGINAL
163-122947-0047 PROBABLY AS PARODISTS OF THE WORLD'S HISTORY AND AS GOD'S MERRY ANDREWS PERHAPS THOUGH NOTHING ELSE OF THE PRESENT HAVE A FUTURE OUR LAUGHTER ITSELF MAY HAVE A FUTURE
163-122947-0048 THE HISTORICAL SENSE OR THE CAPACITY FOR DIVINING QUICKLY THE ORDER OF RANK OF THE VALUATIONS ACCORDING TO WHICH A PEOPLE A COMMUNITY OR AN INDIVIDUAL HAS LIVED
163-122947-0049 THE DIVINING INSTINCT FOR THE RELATIONSHIPS OF THESE VALUATIONS FOR THE RELATION OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE VALUATIONS TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE OPERATING FORCES THIS HISTORICAL SENSE
163-122947-0050 HAS COME TO US IN THE TRAIN OF THE ENCHANTING AND MAD SEMI BARBARITY INTO WHICH EUROPE HAS BEEN PLUNGED BY THE DEMOCRATIC MINGLING OF CLASSES AND RACES IT IS ONLY THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THAT HAS RECOGNIZED THIS FACULTY
163-122947-0051 AS ITS SIXTH SENSE OWING TO THIS MINGLING THE PAST OF EVERY FORM AND MODE OF LIFE AND OF CULTURES WHICH WERE FORMERLY CLOSELY CONTIGUOUS AND SUPERIMPOSED ON ONE ANOTHER FLOWS FORTH INTO US
163-122947-0052 BY MEANS OF OUR SEMI BARBARITY IN BODY AND IN DESIRE WE HAVE SECRET ACCESS EVERYWHERE SUCH AS A NOBLE AGE NEVER HAD WE HAVE ACCESS ABOVE ALL TO THE LABYRINTH OF IMPERFECT CIVILIZATIONS
163-122947-0053 AND TO EVERY FORM OF SEMI BARBARITY THAT HAS AT ANY TIME EXISTED ON EARTH AND IN SO FAR AS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF HUMAN CIVILIZATION HITHERTO HAS JUST BEEN SEMI BARBARITY
163-122947-0054 THE HISTORICAL SENSE IMPLIES ALMOST THE SENSE AND INSTINCT FOR EVERYTHING THE TASTE AND TONGUE FOR EVERYTHING WHEREBY IT IMMEDIATELY PROVES ITSELF TO BE AN IGNOBLE SENSE FOR INSTANCE
163-122947-0055 WE ENJOY HOMER ONCE MORE IT IS PERHAPS OUR HAPPIEST ACQUISITION THAT WE KNOW HOW TO APPRECIATE HOMER WHOM MEN OF DISTINGUISHED CULTURE
163-122947-0056 ESPRIT VASTE AND EVEN VOLTAIRE THE LAST ECHO OF THE CENTURY CANNOT AND COULD NOT SO EASILY APPROPRIATE WHOM THEY SCARCELY PERMITTED THEMSELVES TO ENJOY THE VERY DECIDED YEA
163-122947-0057 A DISSATISFACTION WITH ITS OWN CONDITION OR AN ADMIRATION OF WHAT IS STRANGE ALL THIS DETERMINES AND DISPOSES THEM UNFAVOURABLY EVEN TOWARDS THE BEST THINGS OF THE WORLD WHICH ARE NOT THEIR PROPERTY
163-122947-0058 OR COULD NOT BECOME THEIR PREY AND NO FACULTY IS MORE UNINTELLIGIBLE TO SUCH MEN THAN JUST THIS HISTORICAL SENSE WITH ITS TRUCKLING PLEBEIAN CURIOSITY
163-122947-0059 THE CASE IS NOT DIFFERENT WITH SHAKESPEARE THAT MARVELOUS SPANISH MOORISH SAXON SYNTHESIS OF TASTE OVER WHOM AN ANCIENT ATHENIAN
163-122947-0060 WITH A SECRET CONFIDENCE AND CORDIALITY WE ENJOY IT AS A REFINEMENT OF ART RESERVED EXPRESSLY FOR US AND ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE AS LITTLE DISTURBED BY THE REPULSIVE FUMES AND THE PROXIMITY OF THE ENGLISH POPULACE
163-122947-0061 IN WHICH SHAKESPEARE'S ART AND TASTE LIVES AS PERHAPS ON THE CHIAJA OF NAPLES WHERE WITH ALL OUR SENSES AWAKE WE GO OUR WAY ENCHANTED AND VOLUNTARILY
163-122947-0062 LET US FINALLY CONFESS IT THAT WHAT IS MOST DIFFICULT FOR US MEN OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE TO GRASP FEEL TASTE AND LOVE WHAT FINDS US FUNDAMENTALLY PREJUDICED AND ALMOST HOSTILE
163-122947-0063 IS PRECISELY THE PERFECTION AND ULTIMATE MATURITY IN EVERY CULTURE AND ART THE ESSENTIALLY NOBLE IN WORKS AND MEN THEIR MOMENT OF SMOOTH SEA AND HALCYON SELF SUFFICIENCY
163-122947-0064 THE GOLDENNESS AND COLDNESS WHICH ALL THINGS SHOW THAT HAVE PERFECTED THEMSELVES PERHAPS OUR GREAT VIRTUE OF THE HISTORICAL SENSE IS IN NECESSARY CONTRAST TO GOOD TASTE
163-122947-0065 AT LEAST TO THE VERY BAD TASTE AND WE CAN ONLY EVOKE IN OURSELVES IMPERFECTLY HESITATINGLY AND WITH COMPULSION THE SMALL SHORT AND HAPPY GODSENDS AND GLORIFICATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE
163-122947-0066 AS THEY SHINE HERE AND THERE THOSE MOMENTS AND MARVELOUS EXPERIENCES WHEN A GREAT POWER HAS VOLUNTARILY COME TO A HALT BEFORE THE BOUNDLESS AND INFINITE WHEN A SUPER ABUNDANCE OF REFINED DELIGHT HAS BEEN ENJOYED
163-122947-0067 OUR ITCHING IS REALLY THE ITCHING FOR THE INFINITE THE IMMEASURABLE LIKE THE RIDER ON HIS FORWARD PANTING HORSE WE LET THE REINS FALL BEFORE THE INFINITE WE MODERN MEN WE SEMI BARBARIANS
163-122947-0068 WHETHER IT BE HEDONISM PESSIMISM UTILITARIANISM OR EUDAEMONISM ALL THOSE MODES OF THINKING WHICH MEASURE THE WORTH OF THINGS ACCORDING TO PLEASURE AND PAIN
163-122947-0069 THAT IS ACCORDING TO ACCOMPANYING CIRCUMSTANCES AND SECONDARY CONSIDERATIONS ARE PLAUSIBLE MODES OF THOUGHT AND NAIVETES WHICH EVERY ONE CONSCIOUS OF CREATIVE POWERS AND AN ARTIST'S CONSCIENCE
163-122947-0070 FOR SOCIETY WITH ITS SICK AND MISFORTUNED FOR THE HEREDITARILY VICIOUS AND DEFECTIVE WHO LIE ON THE GROUND AROUND US STILL LESS IS IT SYMPATHY FOR THE GRUMBLING
163-122947-0071 WHO STRIVE AFTER POWER THEY CALL IT FREEDOM OUR SYMPATHY IS A LOFTIER AND FURTHER SIGHTED SYMPATHY WE SEE HOW MAN DWARFS HIMSELF HOW YOU DWARF HIM
163-122947-0072 AND MAKES HIS DESTRUCTION DESIRABLE THE DISCIPLINE OF SUFFERING OF GREAT SUFFERING KNOW YE NOT THAT IT IS ONLY THIS DISCIPLINE THAT HAS PRODUCED ALL THE ELEVATIONS OF HUMANITY HITHERTO
163-122947-0073 THE TENSION OF SOUL IN MISFORTUNE WHICH COMMUNICATES TO IT ITS ENERGY ITS SHUDDERING IN VIEW OF RACK AND RUIN ITS INVENTIVENESS AND BRAVERY IN UNDERGOING ENDURING
163-122947-0074 CREATURE AND CREATOR ARE UNITED IN MAN THERE IS NOT ONLY MATTER SHRED EXCESS CLAY MIRE FOLLY CHAOS BUT THERE IS ALSO THE CREATOR
163-122947-0075 THE SCULPTOR THE HARDNESS OF THE HAMMER THE DIVINITY OF THE SPECTATOR AND THE SEVENTH DAY DO YE UNDERSTAND THIS CONTRAST AND THAT YOUR SYMPATHY FOR THE CREATURE IN MAN
163-122947-0076 APPLIES TO THAT WHICH HAS TO BE FASHIONED BRUISED FORGED STRETCHED ROASTED ANNEALED REFINED
163-122947-0077 SO IT IS SYMPATHY AGAINST SYMPATHY BUT TO REPEAT IT ONCE MORE THERE ARE HIGHER PROBLEMS THAN THE PROBLEMS OF PLEASURE AND PAIN AND SYMPATHY
163-122947-0078 AND ALL SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY WHICH DEAL ONLY WITH THESE ARE NAIVETES TWO HUNDRED TWENTY SIX
163-122947-0079 IN WHICH WE HAVE TO FEAR AND LOVE THIS ALMOST INVISIBLE INAUDIBLE WORLD OF DELICATE COMMAND AND DELICATE OBEDIENCE A WORLD OF ALMOST IN EVERY RESPECT CAPTIOUS INSIDIOUS SHARP
163-122947-0080 AND TENDER YES IT IS WELL PROTECTED FROM CLUMSY SPECTATORS AND FAMILIAR CURIOSITY WE ARE WOVEN INTO A STRONG NET AND GARMENT OF DUTIES AND CANNOT DISENGAGE OURSELVES
163-122947-0081 PRECISELY HERE WE ARE MEN OF DUTY EVEN WE OCCASIONALLY IT IS TRUE WE DANCE IN OUR CHAINS AND BETWIXT OUR SWORDS
163-122947-0082 THESE ARE MEN WITHOUT DUTY WE HAVE ALWAYS FOOLS AND APPEARANCES AGAINST US
163-122947-0083 HONESTY GRANTING THAT IT IS THE VIRTUE OF WHICH WE CANNOT RID OURSELVES WE FREE SPIRITS WELL WE WILL LABOUR AT IT WITH ALL OUR PERVERSITY AND LOVE
163-122947-0084 AND NOT TIRE OF PERFECTING OURSELVES IN OUR VIRTUE WHICH ALONE REMAINS MAY ITS GLANCE SOME DAY OVERSPREAD LIKE A GILDED BLUE MOCKING TWILIGHT
163-122947-0085 LET US GO WITH ALL OUR DEVILS TO THE HELP OF OUR GOD IT IS PROBABLE THAT PEOPLE WILL MISUNDERSTAND AND MISTAKE US ON THAT ACCOUNT WHAT DOES IT MATTER
163-122947-0086 THEY WILL SAY THEIR HONESTY' THAT IS THEIR DEVILRY AND NOTHING ELSE WHAT DOES IT MATTER AND EVEN IF THEY WERE RIGHT HAVE NOT ALL GODS HITHERTO BEEN SUCH SANCTIFIED
163-122947-0087 OUR STUPIDITY EVERY VIRTUE INCLINES TO STUPIDITY EVERY STUPIDITY TO VIRTUE STUPID TO THE POINT OF SANCTITY THEY SAY IN RUSSIA LET US BE CAREFUL LEST
163-122947-0088 HAS BEEN MORE INJURED BY THE TEDIOUSNESS OF ITS ADVOCATES THAN BY ANYTHING ELSE AT THE SAME TIME HOWEVER I WOULD NOT WISH TO OVERLOOK THEIR GENERAL USEFULNESS
163-122947-0089 IT IS DESIRABLE THAT AS FEW PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE SHOULD REFLECT UPON MORALS AND CONSEQUENTLY IT IS VERY DESIRABLE THAT MORALS SHOULD NOT SOME DAY BECOME INTERESTING
163-122947-0090 BUT LET US NOT BE AFRAID THINGS STILL REMAIN TODAY AS THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN I SEE NO ONE IN EUROPE WHO HAS OR DISCLOSES AN IDEA OF THE FACT THAT PHILOSOPHIZING CONCERNING MORALS
163-122947-0091 INEVITABLE ENGLISH UTILITARIANS HOW PONDEROUSLY AND RESPECTABLY THEY STALK ON STALK ALONG A HOMERIC METAPHOR EXPRESSES IT BETTER IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF BENTHAM
163-122947-0092 JUST AS HE HAD ALREADY STALKED IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF THE RESPECTABLE HELVETIUS NO HE WAS NOT A DANGEROUS MAN HELVETIUS C E SENATEUR POCOCURANTE TO USE AN EXPRESSION OF GALIANI
163-122947-0093 NO NEW THOUGHT NOTHING OF THE NATURE OF A FINER TURNING OR BETTER EXPRESSION OF AN OLD THOUGHT NOT EVEN A PROPER HISTORY OF WHAT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT ON THE SUBJECT AN IMPOSSIBLE LITERATURE
163-122947-0094 HAS INSINUATED ITSELF ALSO INTO THESE MORALISTS WHOM ONE MUST CERTAINLY READ WITH AN EYE TO THEIR MOTIVES IF ONE MUST READ THEM CONCEALED THIS TIME UNDER THE NEW FORM OF THE SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT
163-122947-0095 IS NOT A MORALIST THE OPPOSITE OF A PURITAN THAT IS TO SAY AS A THINKER WHO REGARDS MORALITY AS QUESTIONABLE AS WORTHY OF INTERROGATION IN SHORT AS A PROBLEM
163-122947-0096 IS MORALIZING NOT IMMORAL IN THE END THEY ALL WANT ENGLISH MORALITY TO BE RECOGNIZED AS AUTHORITATIVE INASMUCH AS MANKIND OR THE GENERAL UTILITY
163-122947-0097 OR THE HAPPINESS OF THE GREATEST NUMBER NO THE HAPPINESS OF ENGLAND WILL BE BEST SERVED THEREBY THEY WOULD LIKE BY ALL MEANS TO CONVINCE THEMSELVES THAT THE STRIVING AFTER ENGLISH HAPPINESS
163-122947-0098 I MEAN AFTER COMFORT AND FASHION
1723-141149-0000 PONSONBY SOUND BUILD WIGWAMS AND SETTLE THE FUEGIANS BIFURCATION OF THE BEAGLE CHANNEL GLACIERS RETURN TO THE SHIP SECOND VISIT IN THE SHIP TO THE SETTLEMENT EQUALITY OF CONDITION AMONGST THE NATIVES
1723-141149-0001 HAVING NOW FINISHED WITH PATAGONIA AND THE FALKLAND ISLANDS I WILL DESCRIBE OUR FIRST ARRIVAL IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO A LITTLE AFTER NOON WE DOUBLED CAPE SAINT DIEGO AND ENTERED THE FAMOUS STRAIT OF LE MAIRE
1723-141149-0002 WE KEPT CLOSE TO THE FUEGIAN SHORE BUT THE OUTLINE OF THE RUGGED INHOSPITABLE STATENLAND WAS VISIBLE AMIDST THE CLOUDS IN THE AFTERNOON WE ANCHORED IN THE BAY OF GOOD SUCCESS WHILE ENTERING WE WERE SALUTED IN A MANNER BECOMING THE INHABITANTS OF THIS SAVAGE LAND
1723-141149-0003 A GROUP OF FUEGIANS PARTLY CONCEALED BY THE ENTANGLED FOREST WERE PERCHED ON A WILD POINT OVERHANGING THE SEA AND AS WE PASSED BY THEY SPRANG UP AND WAVING THEIR TATTERED CLOAKS SENT FORTH A LOUD AND SONOROUS SHOUT THE SAVAGES FOLLOWED THE SHIP
1723-141149-0004 AND JUST BEFORE DARK WE SAW THEIR FIRE AND AGAIN HEARD THEIR WILD CRY THE HARBOUR CONSISTS OF A FINE PIECE OF WATER HALF SURROUNDED BY LOW ROUNDED MOUNTAINS OF CLAY SLATE WHICH ARE COVERED TO THE WATER'S EDGE BY ONE DENSE GLOOMY FOREST
1723-141149-0005 A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE LANDSCAPE WAS SUFFICIENT TO SHOW ME HOW WIDELY DIFFERENT IT WAS FROM ANYTHING I HAD EVER BEHELD AT NIGHT IT BLEW A GALE OF WIND AND HEAVY SQUALLS FROM THE MOUNTAINS SWEPT PAST US
1723-141149-0006 AND WE AS WELL AS OTHERS MAY CALL THIS GOOD SUCCESS BAY IN THE MORNING THE CAPTAIN SENT A PARTY TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE FUEGIANS WHEN WE CAME WITHIN HAIL
1723-141149-0007 AND BEGAN TO SHOUT MOST VEHEMENTLY WISHING TO DIRECT US WHERE TO LAND WHEN WE WERE ON SHORE THE PARTY LOOKED RATHER ALARMED BUT CONTINUED TALKING AND MAKING GESTURES WITH GREAT RAPIDITY IT WAS WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE MOST CURIOUS AND INTERESTING SPECTACLE I EVER BEHELD
1723-141149-0008 I COULD NOT HAVE BELIEVED HOW WIDE WAS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SAVAGE AND CIVILIZED MAN IT IS GREATER THAN BETWEEN A WILD AND DOMESTICATED ANIMAL
1723-141149-0009 THE CHIEF SPOKESMAN WAS OLD AND APPEARED TO BE THE HEAD OF THE FAMILY THE THREE OTHERS WERE POWERFUL YOUNG MEN ABOUT SIX FEET HIGH THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN HAD BEEN SENT AWAY THESE FUEGIANS ARE A VERY DIFFERENT RACE FROM THE STUNTED MISERABLE WRETCHES FARTHER WESTWARD
1723-141149-0010 AND THEY SEEM CLOSELY ALLIED TO THE FAMOUS PATAGONIANS OF THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN THEIR ONLY GARMENT CONSISTS OF A MANTLE MADE OF GUANACO SKIN WITH THE WOOL OUTSIDE THIS THEY WEAR JUST THROWN OVER THEIR SHOULDERS LEAVING THEIR PERSONS AS OFTEN EXPOSED AS COVERED
1723-141149-0011 HIS FACE WAS CROSSED BY TWO BROAD TRANSVERSE BARS ONE PAINTED BRIGHT RED REACHED FROM EAR TO EAR AND INCLUDED THE UPPER LIP THE OTHER WHITE LIKE CHALK EXTENDED ABOVE AND PARALLEL TO THE FIRST SO THAT EVEN HIS EYELIDS WERE THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0012 THE OTHER TWO MEN WERE ORNAMENTED BY STREAKS OF BLACK POWDER MADE OF CHARCOAL THE PARTY ALTOGETHER CLOSELY RESEMBLED THE DEVILS WHICH COME ON THE STAGE IN PLAYS LIKE DER FREISCHUTZ THEIR VERY ATTITUDES WERE ABJECT
1723-141149-0013 AND THE EXPRESSION OF THEIR COUNTENANCES DISTRUSTFUL SURPRISED AND STARTLED AFTER WE HAD PRESENTED THEM WITH SOME SCARLET CLOTH WHICH THEY IMMEDIATELY TIED ROUND THEIR NECKS THEY BECAME GOOD FRIENDS THIS WAS SHOWN BY THE OLD MAN PATTING OUR BREASTS
1723-141149-0014 AS PEOPLE DO WHEN FEEDING CHICKENS I WALKED WITH THE OLD MAN AND THIS DEMONSTRATION OF FRIENDSHIP WAS REPEATED SEVERAL TIMES IT WAS CONCLUDED BY THREE HARD SLAPS WHICH WERE GIVEN ME ON THE BREAST AND BACK AT THE SAME TIME HE THEN BARED HIS BOSOM FOR ME TO RETURN THE COMPLIMENT WHICH BEING DONE
1723-141149-0015 HE SEEMED HIGHLY PLEASED THE LANGUAGE OF THESE PEOPLE ACCORDING TO OUR NOTIONS SCARCELY DESERVES TO BE CALLED ARTICULATE CAPTAIN COOK HAS COMPARED IT TO A MAN CLEARING HIS THROAT BUT CERTAINLY NO EUROPEAN EVER CLEARED HIS THROAT WITH SO MANY HOARSE GUTTURAL AND CLICKING SOUNDS
1723-141149-0016 THEY ARE EXCELLENT MIMICS AS OFTEN AS WE COUGHED OR YAWNED OR MADE ANY ODD MOTION THEY IMMEDIATELY IMITATED US SOME OF OUR PARTY BEGAN TO SQUINT AND LOOK AWRY BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG FUEGIANS WHOSE WHOLE FACE WAS PAINTED BLACK EXCEPTING A WHITE BAND ACROSS HIS EYES
1723-141149-0017 SUCCEEDED IN MAKING FAR MORE HIDEOUS GRIMACES THEY COULD REPEAT WITH PERFECT CORRECTNESS EACH WORD IN ANY SENTENCE WE ADDRESSED THEM AND THEY REMEMBERED SUCH WORDS FOR SOME TIME YET WE EUROPEANS ALL KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISTINGUISH APART THE SOUNDS IN A FOREIGN LANGUAGE
1723-141149-0018 WHICH OF US FOR INSTANCE COULD FOLLOW AN AMERICAN INDIAN THROUGH A SENTENCE OF MORE THAN THREE WORDS ALL SAVAGES APPEAR TO POSSESS TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE THIS POWER OF MIMICRY I WAS TOLD ALMOST IN THE SAME WORDS OF THE SAME LUDICROUS HABIT AMONG THE CAFFRES
1723-141149-0019 THE AUSTRALIANS LIKEWISE HAVE LONG BEEN NOTORIOUS FOR BEING ABLE TO IMITATE AND DESCRIBE THE GAIT OF ANY MAN SO THAT HE MAY BE RECOGNIZED HOW CAN THIS FACULTY BE EXPLAINED IS IT A CONSEQUENCE OF THE MORE PRACTISED HABITS OF PERCEPTION AND KEENER SENSES COMMON TO ALL MEN IN A SAVAGE STATE
1723-141149-0020 AS COMPARED WITH THOSE LONG CIVILIZED WHEN A SONG WAS STRUCK UP BY OUR PARTY I THOUGHT THE FUEGIANS WOULD HAVE FALLEN DOWN WITH ASTONISHMENT WITH EQUAL SURPRISE THEY VIEWED OUR DANCING BUT ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN WHEN ASKED HAD NO OBJECTION TO A LITTLE WALTZING
1723-141149-0021 LITTLE ACCUSTOMED TO EUROPEANS AS THEY APPEARED TO BE YET THEY KNEW AND DREADED OUR FIRE ARMS NOTHING WOULD TEMPT THEM TO TAKE A GUN IN THEIR HANDS THEY BEGGED FOR KNIVES CALLING THEM BY THE SPANISH WORD
1723-141149-0022 THEY EXPLAINED ALSO WHAT THEY WANTED BY ACTING AS IF THEY HAD A PIECE OF BLUBBER IN THEIR MOUTH AND THEN PRETENDING TO CUT INSTEAD OF TEAR IT I HAVE NOT AS YET NOTICED THE FUEGIANS WHOM WE HAD ON BOARD
1723-141149-0023 DURING THE FORMER VOYAGE OF THE ADVENTURE AND BEAGLE IN EIGHTEEN TWENTY SIX TO EIGHTEEN THIRTY CAPTAIN FITZ ROY SEIZED ON A PARTY OF NATIVES AS HOSTAGES FOR THE LOSS OF A BOAT WHICH HAD BEEN STOLEN TO THE GREAT JEOPARDY OF A PARTY EMPLOYED ON THE SURVEY
1723-141149-0024 AND SOME OF THESE NATIVES AS WELL AS A CHILD WHOM HE BOUGHT FOR A PEARL BUTTON HE TOOK WITH HIM TO ENGLAND DETERMINING TO EDUCATE THEM AND INSTRUCT THEM IN RELIGION AT HIS OWN EXPENSE TO SETTLE THESE NATIVES IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY
1723-141149-0025 WAS ONE CHIEF INDUCEMENT TO CAPTAIN FITZ ROY TO UNDERTAKE OUR PRESENT VOYAGE AND BEFORE THE ADMIRALTY HAD RESOLVED TO SEND OUT THIS EXPEDITION CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAD GENEROUSLY CHARTERED A VESSEL AND WOULD HIMSELF HAVE TAKEN THEM BACK THE NATIVES WERE ACCOMPANIED BY A MISSIONARY
1723-141149-0026 R MATTHEWS OF WHOM AND OF THE NATIVES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS PUBLISHED A FULL AND EXCELLENT ACCOUNT TWO MEN ONE OF WHOM DIED IN ENGLAND OF THE SMALL POX A BOY AND A LITTLE GIRL WERE ORIGINALLY TAKEN AND WE HAD NOW ON BOARD
1723-141149-0027 YORK MINSTER JEMMY BUTTON WHOSE NAME EXPRESSES HIS PURCHASE MONEY AND FUEGIA BASKET YORK MINSTER WAS A FULL GROWN SHORT THICK POWERFUL MAN HIS DISPOSITION WAS RESERVED TACITURN MOROSE
1723-141149-0028 AND WHEN EXCITED VIOLENTLY PASSIONATE HIS AFFECTIONS WERE VERY STRONG TOWARDS A FEW FRIENDS ON BOARD HIS INTELLECT GOOD JEMMY BUTTON WAS A UNIVERSAL FAVOURITE BUT LIKEWISE PASSIONATE THE EXPRESSION OF HIS FACE AT ONCE SHOWED HIS NICE DISPOSITION
1723-141149-0029 HE WAS MERRY AND OFTEN LAUGHED AND WAS REMARKABLY SYMPATHETIC WITH ANY ONE IN PAIN WHEN THE WATER WAS ROUGH I WAS OFTEN A LITTLE SEA SICK AND HE USED TO COME TO ME AND SAY IN A PLAINTIVE VOICE POOR POOR FELLOW BUT THE NOTION AFTER HIS AQUATIC LIFE
1723-141149-0030 OF A MAN BEING SEA SICK WAS TOO LUDICROUS AND HE WAS GENERALLY OBLIGED TO TURN ON ONE SIDE TO HIDE A SMILE OR LAUGH
1723-141149-0031 POOR POOR FELLOW HE WAS OF A PATRIOTIC DISPOSITION AND HE LIKED TO PRAISE HIS OWN TRIBE AND COUNTRY
1723-141149-0032 AND HE ABUSED ALL THE OTHER TRIBES HE STOUTLY DECLARED THAT THERE WAS NO DEVIL IN HIS LAND JEMMY WAS SHORT THICK AND FAT BUT VAIN OF HIS PERSONAL APPEARANCE HE USED ALWAYS TO WEAR GLOVES
1723-141149-0033 HIS HAIR WAS NEATLY CUT AND HE WAS DISTRESSED IF HIS WELL POLISHED SHOES WERE DIRTIED HE WAS FOND OF ADMIRING HIMSELF IN A LOOKING GLASS AND A MERRY FACED LITTLE INDIAN BOY FROM THE RIO NEGRO WHOM WE HAD FOR SOME MONTHS ON BOARD SOON PERCEIVED THIS AND USED TO MOCK HIM
1723-141149-0034 TOO MUCH SKYLARK IT SEEMS YET WONDERFUL TO ME WHEN I THINK OVER ALL HIS MANY GOOD QUALITIES THAT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN OF THE SAME RACE AND DOUBTLESS PARTAKEN OF THE SAME CHARACTER WITH THE MISERABLE DEGRADED SAVAGES WHOM WE FIRST MET HERE LASTLY
1723-141149-0035 FUEGIA BASKET WAS A NICE MODEST RESERVED YOUNG GIRL WITH A RATHER PLEASING BUT SOMETIMES SULLEN EXPRESSION AND VERY QUICK IN LEARNING ANYTHING ESPECIALLY LANGUAGES THIS SHE SHOWED IN PICKING UP SOME PORTUGUESE AND SPANISH
1723-141149-0036 ALTHOUGH ALL THREE COULD BOTH SPEAK AND UNDERSTAND A GOOD DEAL OF ENGLISH IT WAS SINGULARLY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN MUCH INFORMATION FROM THEM CONCERNING THE HABITS OF THEIR COUNTRYMEN THIS WAS PARTLY OWING TO THEIR APPARENT DIFFICULTY IN UNDERSTANDING THE SIMPLEST ALTERNATIVE
1723-141149-0037 EVERY ONE ACCUSTOMED TO VERY YOUNG CHILDREN KNOWS HOW SELDOM ONE CAN GET AN ANSWER EVEN TO SO SIMPLE A QUESTION AS WHETHER A THING IS BLACK OR WHITE THE IDEA OF BLACK OR WHITE SEEMS ALTERNATELY TO FILL THEIR MINDS SO IT WAS WITH THESE FUEGIANS
1723-141149-0038 AND HENCE IT WAS GENERALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND OUT BY CROSS QUESTIONING WHETHER ONE HAD RIGHTLY UNDERSTOOD ANYTHING WHICH THEY HAD ASSERTED THEIR SIGHT WAS REMARKABLY ACUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT SAILORS FROM LONG PRACTICE CAN MAKE OUT A DISTANT OBJECT MUCH BETTER THAN A LANDSMAN
1723-141149-0039 AND JEMMY WHEN HE HAD ANY LITTLE QUARREL WITH THE OFFICER ON WATCH WOULD SAY ME SEE SHIP ME NO TELL IT WAS INTERESTING TO WATCH THE CONDUCT OF THE SAVAGES WHEN WE LANDED TOWARDS JEMMY BUTTON
1723-141149-0040 THEY IMMEDIATELY PERCEIVED THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HIM AND OURSELVES AND HELD MUCH CONVERSATION ONE WITH ANOTHER ON THE SUBJECT THE OLD MAN ADDRESSED A LONG HARANGUE TO JEMMY WHICH IT SEEMS WAS TO INVITE HIM TO STAY WITH THEM
1723-141149-0041 BUT JEMMY UNDERSTOOD VERY LITTLE OF THEIR LANGUAGE AND WAS MOREOVER THOROUGHLY ASHAMED OF HIS COUNTRYMEN WHEN YORK MINSTER AFTERWARDS CAME ON SHORE THEY NOTICED HIM IN THE SAME WAY AND TOLD HIM HE OUGHT TO SHAVE YET HE HAD NOT TWENTY DWARF HAIRS ON HIS FACE WHILST WE ALL WORE OUR UNTRIMMED BEARDS
1723-141149-0042 THEY EXAMINED THE COLOUR OF HIS SKIN AND COMPARED IT WITH OURS ONE OF OUR ARMS BEING BARED THEY EXPRESSED THE LIVELIEST SURPRISE AND ADMIRATION AT ITS WHITENESS JUST IN THE SAME WAY IN WHICH I HAVE SEEN THE OURANGOUTANG DO AT THE ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS
1723-141149-0043 WE THOUGHT THAT THEY MISTOOK TWO OR THREE OF THE OFFICERS WHO WERE RATHER SHORTER AND FAIRER THOUGH ADORNED WITH LARGE BEARDS FOR THE LADIES OF OUR PARTY
1723-141149-0044 THAT I DARE SAY HE THOUGHT HIMSELF THE HANDSOMEST MAN IN TIERRA DEL FUEGO AFTER OUR FIRST FEELING OF GRAVE ASTONISHMENT WAS OVER NOTHING COULD BE MORE LUDICROUS THAN THE ODD MIXTURE OF SURPRISE AND IMITATION WHICH THESE SAVAGES EVERY MOMENT EXHIBITED
1723-141149-0045 THE NEXT DAY I ATTEMPTED TO PENETRATE SOME WAY INTO THE COUNTRY TIERRA DEL FUEGO MAY BE DESCRIBED AS A MOUNTAINOUS LAND PARTLY SUBMERGED IN THE SEA SO THAT DEEP INLETS AND BAYS OCCUPY THE PLACE WHERE VALLEYS SHOULD EXIST
1723-141149-0046 THE MOUNTAIN SIDES EXCEPT ON THE EXPOSED WESTERN COAST ARE COVERED FROM THE WATER'S EDGE UPWARDS BY ONE GREAT FOREST
1723-141149-0047 AND ARE SUCCEEDED BY A BAND OF PEAT WITH MINUTE ALPINE PLANTS AND THIS AGAIN IS SUCCEEDED BY THE LINE OF PERPETUAL SNOW WHICH ACCORDING TO CAPTAIN KING IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN DESCENDS TO BETWEEN THREE THOUSAND AND FOUR THOUSAND FEET
1723-141149-0048 IS MOST RARE I RECOLLECT ONLY ONE LITTLE FLAT PIECE NEAR PORT FAMINE AND ANOTHER OF RATHER LARGER EXTENT NEAR GOEREE ROAD IN BOTH PLACES AND EVERYWHERE ELSE THE SURFACE IS COVERED BY A THICK BED OF SWAMPY PEAT EVEN WITHIN THE FOREST
1723-141149-0049 THE GROUND IS CONCEALED BY A MASS OF SLOWLY PUTREFYING VEGETABLE MATTER WHICH FROM BEING SOAKED WITH WATER YIELDS TO THE FOOT FINDING IT NEARLY HOPELESS TO PUSH MY WAY THROUGH THE WOOD I FOLLOWED THE COURSE OF A MOUNTAIN TORRENT
1723-141149-0050 AT FIRST FROM THE WATERFALLS AND NUMBER OF DEAD TREES I COULD HARDLY CRAWL ALONG BUT THE BED OF THE STREAM SOON BECAME A LITTLE MORE OPEN FROM THE FLOODS HAVING SWEPT THE SIDES I CONTINUED SLOWLY TO ADVANCE FOR AN HOUR ALONG THE BROKEN AND ROCKY BANKS
1723-141149-0051 AND WAS AMPLY REPAID BY THE GRANDEUR OF THE SCENE THE GLOOMY DEPTH OF THE RAVINE WELL ACCORDED WITH THE UNIVERSAL SIGNS OF VIOLENCE ON EVERY SIDE WERE LYING IRREGULAR MASSES OF ROCK AND TORN UP TREES OTHER TREES THOUGH STILL ERECT
1723-141149-0052 WERE DECAYED TO THE HEART AND READY TO FALL THE ENTANGLED MASS OF THE THRIVING AND THE FALLEN REMINDED ME OF THE FORESTS WITHIN THE TROPICS YET THERE WAS A DIFFERENCE FOR IN THESE STILL SOLITUDES DEATH INSTEAD OF LIFE SEEMED THE PREDOMINANT SPIRIT
1723-141149-0053 HAD CLEARED A STRAIGHT SPACE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SIDE BY THIS ROAD I ASCENDED TO A CONSIDERABLE ELEVATION AND OBTAINED A GOOD VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING WOODS THE TREES ALL BELONG TO ONE KIND THE FAGUS BETULOIDES
1723-141149-0054 FOR THE NUMBER OF THE OTHER SPECIES OF FAGUS AND OF THE WINTER'S BARK IS QUITE INCONSIDERABLE THIS BEECH KEEPS ITS LEAVES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR BUT ITS FOLIAGE IS OF A PECULIAR BROWNISH GREEN COLOUR WITH A TINGE OF YELLOW AS THE WHOLE LANDSCAPE IS THUS COLOURED
1723-141149-0055 IT HAS A SOMBRE DULL APPEARANCE NOR IS IT OFTEN ENLIVENED BY THE RAYS OF THE SUN
1723-141149-0056 ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET HIGH WHICH CAPTAIN FITZ ROY HAS CALLED AFTER SIR J BANKS IN COMMEMORATION OF HIS DISASTROUS EXCURSION WHICH PROVED FATAL TO TWO MEN OF HIS PARTY AND NEARLY SO TO DOCTOR SOLANDER THE SNOW STORM WHICH WAS THE CAUSE OF THEIR MISFORTUNE
1723-141149-0057 WE FOLLOWED THE SAME WATER COURSE AS ON THE PREVIOUS DAY TILL IT DWINDLED AWAY AND WE WERE THEN COMPELLED TO CRAWL BLINDLY AMONG THE TREES THESE FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE ELEVATION AND OF THE IMPETUOUS WINDS WERE LOW THICK AND CROOKED
1723-141149-0058 AT LENGTH WE REACHED THAT WHICH FROM A DISTANCE APPEARED LIKE A CARPET OF FINE GREEN TURF BUT WHICH TO OUR VEXATION TURNED OUT TO BE A COMPACT MASS OF LITTLE BEECH TREES ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE FEET HIGH
1723-141149-0059 THEY WERE AS THICK TOGETHER AS BOX IN THE BORDER OF A GARDEN AND WE WERE OBLIGED TO STRUGGLE OVER THE FLAT BUT TREACHEROUS SURFACE
1723-141149-0060 A RIDGE CONNECTED THIS HILL WITH ANOTHER DISTANT SOME MILES AND MORE LOFTY SO THAT PATCHES OF SNOW WERE LYING ON IT AS THE DAY WAS NOT FAR ADVANCED I DETERMINED TO WALK THERE AND COLLECT PLANTS ALONG THE ROAD
1723-141149-0061 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY HARD WORK HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR A WELL BEATEN AND STRAIGHT PATH MADE BY THE GUANACOS FOR THESE ANIMALS LIKE SHEEP ALWAYS FOLLOW THE SAME LINE WHEN WE REACHED THE HILL WE FOUND IT THE HIGHEST IN THE IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD
1723-141149-0062 AND THE WATERS FLOWED TO THE SEA IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS WE OBTAINED A WIDE VIEW OVER THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY TO THE NORTH A SWAMPY MOORLAND EXTENDED
1723-141149-0063 WELL BECOMING TIERRA DEL FUEGO THERE WAS A DEGREE OF MYSTERIOUS GRANDEUR IN MOUNTAIN BEHIND MOUNTAIN WITH THE DEEP INTERVENING VALLEYS ALL COVERED BY ONE THICK DUSKY MASS OF FOREST THE ATMOSPHERE LIKEWISE IN THIS CLIMATE
1723-141149-0064 WHERE GALE SUCCEEDS GALE WITH RAIN HAIL AND SLEET SEEMS BLACKER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE STRAIT OF MAGELLAN LOOKING DUE SOUTHWARD FROM PORT FAMINE THE DISTANT CHANNELS BETWEEN THE MOUNTAINS APPEARED FROM THEIR GLOOMINESS TO LEAD BEYOND THE CONFINES OF THIS WORLD
1723-141149-0065 AND ON THE SUCCEEDING DAY FAVOURED TO AN UNCOMMON DEGREE BY A FINE EASTERLY BREEZE WE CLOSED IN WITH THE BARNEVELTS AND RUNNING PAST CAPE DECEIT WITH ITS STONY PEAKS ABOUT THREE O'CLOCK DOUBLED THE WEATHER BEATEN CAPE HORN THE EVENING WAS CALM AND BRIGHT
1723-141149-0066 AND WE ENJOYED A FINE VIEW OF THE SURROUNDING ISLES CAPE HORN HOWEVER DEMANDED HIS TRIBUTE AND BEFORE NIGHT SENT US A GALE OF WIND DIRECTLY IN OUR TEETH WE STOOD OUT TO SEA AND ON THE SECOND DAY AGAIN MADE THE LAND
1723-141149-0067 WHEN WE SAW ON OUR WEATHER BOW THIS NOTORIOUS PROMONTORY IN ITS PROPER FORM VEILED IN A MIST AND ITS DIM OUTLINE SURROUNDED BY A STORM OF WIND AND WATER GREAT BLACK CLOUDS WERE ROLLING ACROSS THE HEAVENS AND SQUALLS OF RAIN WITH HAIL
1723-141149-0068 THAT THE CAPTAIN DETERMINED TO RUN INTO WIGWAM COVE THIS IS A SNUG LITTLE HARBOUR NOT FAR FROM CAPE HORN AND HERE AT CHRISTMAS EVE WE ANCHORED IN SMOOTH WATER THE ONLY THING WHICH REMINDED US OF THE GALE OUTSIDE
1723-141149-0069 WAS EVERY NOW AND THEN A PUFF FROM THE MOUNTAINS WHICH MADE THE SHIP SURGE AT HER ANCHORS
1723-141149-0070 RISES TO THE HEIGHT OF SEVENTEEN HUNDRED FEET THE SURROUNDING ISLANDS ALL CONSIST OF CONICAL MASSES OF GREENSTONE ASSOCIATED SOMETIMES WITH LESS REGULAR HILLS OF BAKED AND ALTERED CLAY SLATE THIS PART OF TIERRA DEL FUEGO
1723-141149-0071 MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE EXTREMITY OF THE SUBMERGED CHAIN OF MOUNTAINS ALREADY ALLUDED TO THE COVE TAKES ITS NAME OF WIGWAM FROM SOME OF THE FUEGIAN HABITATIONS BUT EVERY BAY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD MIGHT BE SO CALLED WITH EQUAL PROPRIETY THE INHABITANTS
1723-141149-0072 LIVING CHIEFLY UPON SHELL FISH ARE OBLIGED CONSTANTLY TO CHANGE THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE BUT THEY RETURN AT INTERVALS TO THE SAME SPOTS AS IS EVIDENT FROM THE PILES OF OLD SHELLS WHICH MUST OFTEN AMOUNT TO MANY TONS IN FREIGHT
1723-141149-0073 THE FUEGIAN WIGWAM RESEMBLES IN SIZE AND DIMENSIONS A HAYCOCK IT MERELY CONSISTS OF A FEW BROKEN BRANCHES STUCK IN THE GROUND AND VERY IMPERFECTLY THATCHED ON ONE SIDE WITH A FEW TUFTS OF GRASS AND RUSHES THE WHOLE CANNOT BE THE WORK OF AN HOUR
1723-141149-0074 AND IT IS ONLY USED FOR A FEW DAYS AT GOEREE ROADS I SAW A PLACE WHERE ONE OF THESE NAKED MEN HAD SLEPT WHICH ABSOLUTELY OFFERED NO MORE COVER THAN THE FORM OF A HARE THE MAN WAS EVIDENTLY LIVING BY HIMSELF
1723-141149-0075 ON THE WEST COAST HOWEVER THE WIGWAMS ARE RATHER BETTER FOR THEY ARE COVERED WITH SEAL SKINS WE WERE DETAINED HERE SEVERAL DAYS BY THE BAD WEATHER THE CLIMATE IS CERTAINLY WRETCHED THE SUMMER SOLSTICE WAS NOW PASSED
1723-141149-0076 YET EVERY DAY SNOW FELL ON THE HILLS AND IN THE VALLEYS THERE WAS RAIN ACCOMPANIED BY SLEET THE THERMOMETER GENERALLY STOOD
1723-141149-0077 FROM THE DAMP AND BOISTEROUS STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE
1723-141149-0078 ONE FANCIED THE CLIMATE EVEN WORSE THAN IT REALLY WAS WHILE GOING ONE DAY ON SHORE NEAR WOLLASTON ISLAND WE PULLED ALONGSIDE A CANOE WITH SIX FUEGIANS THESE WERE THE MOST ABJECT AND MISERABLE CREATURES I ANYWHERE BEHELD
1723-141149-0079 ON THE EAST COAST THE NATIVES AS WE HAVE SEEN HAVE GUANACO CLOAKS AND ON THE WEST THEY POSSESS SEAL SKINS AMONGST THESE CENTRAL TRIBES THE MEN GENERALLY HAVE AN OTTER SKIN OR SOME SMALL SCRAP ABOUT AS LARGE AS A POCKET HANDKERCHIEF
1723-141149-0080 WHICH IS BARELY SUFFICIENT TO COVER THEIR BACKS AS LOW DOWN AS THEIR LOINS IT IS LACED ACROSS THE BREAST BY STRINGS AND ACCORDING AS THE WIND BLOWS IT IS SHIFTED FROM SIDE TO SIDE BUT THESE FUEGIANS IN THE CANOE WERE QUITE NAKED AND EVEN ONE FULL GROWN WOMAN WAS ABSOLUTELY SO
1723-141149-0081 IT WAS RAINING HEAVILY AND THE FRESH WATER TOGETHER WITH THE SPRAY TRICKLED DOWN HER BODY IN ANOTHER HARBOUR NOT FAR DISTANT A WOMAN WHO WAS SUCKLING A RECENTLY BORN CHILD CAME ONE DAY ALONGSIDE THE VESSEL AND REMAINED THERE OUT OF MERE CURIOSITY
1723-141149-0082 THEIR VOICES DISCORDANT AND THEIR GESTURES VIOLENT VIEWING SUCH MEN ONE CAN HARDLY MAKE ONE'S SELF BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE FELLOW CREATURES AND INHABITANTS OF THE SAME WORLD IT IS A COMMON SUBJECT OF CONJECTURE WHAT PLEASURE IN LIFE SOME OF THE LOWER ANIMALS CAN ENJOY
1723-141149-0083 HOW MUCH MORE REASONABLY THE SAME QUESTION MAY BE ASKED WITH RESPECT TO THESE BARBARIANS AT NIGHT FIVE OR SIX HUMAN BEINGS NAKED AND SCARCELY PROTECTED FROM THE WIND AND RAIN OF THIS TEMPESTUOUS CLIMATE SLEEP ON THE WET GROUND COILED UP LIKE ANIMALS
1723-141149-0084 WHENEVER IT IS LOW WATER WINTER OR SUMMER NIGHT OR DAY THEY MUST RISE TO PICK SHELL FISH FROM THE ROCKS AND THE WOMEN EITHER DIVE TO COLLECT SEA EGGS OR SIT PATIENTLY IN THEIR CANOES AND WITH A BAITED HAIR LINE WITHOUT ANY HOOK JERK OUT LITTLE FISH
1723-141149-0085 IF A SEAL IS KILLED OR THE FLOATING CARCASS OF A PUTRID WHALE IS DISCOVERED IT IS A FEAST AND SUCH MISERABLE FOOD IS ASSISTED BY A FEW TASTELESS BERRIES AND FUNGI THEY OFTEN SUFFER FROM FAMINE
1723-141149-0086 I HEARD MISTER LOW A SEALING MASTER INTIMATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE NATIVES OF THIS COUNTRY GIVE A CURIOUS ACCOUNT OF THE STATE OF A PARTY OF ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY NATIVES ON THE WEST COAST WHO WERE VERY THIN AND IN GREAT DISTRESS
1723-141149-0087 A SUCCESSION OF GALES PREVENTED THE WOMEN FROM GETTING SHELL FISH ON THE ROCKS AND THEY COULD NOT GO OUT IN THEIR CANOES TO CATCH SEAL A SMALL PARTY OF THESE MEN ONE MORNING SET OUT AND THE OTHER INDIANS EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT THEY WERE GOING A FOUR DAYS JOURNEY FOR FOOD
1723-141149-0088 AS SOON AS THE BLUBBER WAS BROUGHT INTO A WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CUT OFF THIN SLICES AND MUTTERING OVER THEM BROILED THEM FOR A MINUTE
1723-141149-0089 WHO DURING THIS TIME PRESERVED A PROFOUND SILENCE MISTER LOW BELIEVES THAT WHENEVER A WHALE IS CAST ON SHORE THE NATIVES BURY LARGE PIECES OF IT IN THE SAND AS A RESOURCE IN TIME OF FAMINE AND A NATIVE BOY WHOM HE HAD ON BOARD ONCE FOUND A STOCK THUS BURIED
1723-141149-0090 THE DIFFERENT TRIBES WHEN AT WAR ARE CANNIBALS FROM THE CONCURRENT BUT QUITE INDEPENDENT EVIDENCE OF THE BOY TAKEN BY MISTER LOW AND OF JEMMY BUTTON IT IS CERTAINLY TRUE THAT WHEN PRESSED IN WINTER BY HUNGER
1723-141149-0091 THEY KILL AND DEVOUR THEIR OLD WOMEN BEFORE THEY KILL THEIR DOGS THE BOY BEING ASKED BY MISTER LOW WHY THEY DID THIS ANSWERED DOGGIES CATCH OTTERS OLD WOMEN NO THIS BOY DESCRIBED THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY ARE KILLED BY BEING HELD OVER SMOKE AND THUS CHOKED
1723-141149-0092 HE IMITATED THEIR SCREAMS AS A JOKE AND DESCRIBED THE PARTS OF THEIR BODIES WHICH ARE CONSIDERED BEST TO EAT HORRID AS SUCH A DEATH BY THE HANDS OF THEIR FRIENDS AND RELATIVES MUST BE THE FEARS OF THE OLD WOMEN WHEN HUNGER BEGINS TO PRESS ARE MORE PAINFUL TO THINK OF
1723-141149-0093 BUT THAT THEY ARE PURSUED BY THE MEN AND BROUGHT BACK TO THE SLAUGHTER HOUSE AT THEIR OWN FIRESIDES CAPTAIN FITZ ROY COULD NEVER ASCERTAIN THAT THE FUEGIANS HAVE ANY DISTINCT BELIEF IN A FUTURE LIFE THEY SOMETIMES BURY THEIR DEAD IN CAVES
1723-141149-0094 AND SOMETIMES IN THE MOUNTAIN FORESTS WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT CEREMONIES THEY PERFORM JEMMY BUTTON WOULD NOT EAT LAND BIRDS BECAUSE EAT DEAD MEN THEY ARE UNWILLING EVEN TO MENTION THEIR DEAD FRIENDS WE HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THEY PERFORM ANY SORT OF RELIGIOUS WORSHIP
1723-141149-0095 THOUGH PERHAPS THE MUTTERING OF THE OLD MAN BEFORE HE DISTRIBUTED THE PUTRID BLUBBER TO HIS FAMISHED PARTY MAY BE OF THIS NATURE EACH FAMILY OR TRIBE HAS A WIZARD OR CONJURING DOCTOR WHOSE OFFICE WE COULD NEVER CLEARLY ASCERTAIN JEMMY BELIEVED IN DREAMS
1723-141149-0096 THOUGH NOT AS I HAVE SAID IN THE DEVIL I DO NOT THINK THAT OUR FUEGIANS WERE MUCH MORE SUPERSTITIOUS THAN SOME OF THE SAILORS FOR AN OLD QUARTERMASTER FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT THE SUCCESSIVE HEAVY GALES WHICH WE ENCOUNTERED OFF CAPE HORN WERE CAUSED BY OUR HAVING THE FUEGIANS ON BOARD
1723-141149-0097 THE NEAREST APPROACH TO A RELIGIOUS FEELING WHICH I HEARD OF WAS SHOWN BY YORK MINSTER
1723-141149-0098 IN A WILD AND EXCITED MANNER HE ALSO RELATED THAT HIS BROTHER ONE DAY WHILST RETURNING TO PICK UP SOME DEAD BIRDS WHICH HE HAD LEFT ON THE COAST OBSERVED SOME FEATHERS BLOWN BY THE WIND HIS BROTHER SAID YORK IMITATING HIS MANNER WHAT THAT
1723-141149-0099 AND CRAWLING ONWARDS HE PEEPED OVER THE CLIFF AND SAW WILD MAN PICKING HIS BIRDS HE CRAWLED A LITTLE NEARER AND THEN HURLED DOWN A GREAT STONE AND KILLED HIM YORK DECLARED FOR A LONG TIME AFTERWARDS STORMS RAGED AND MUCH RAIN AND SNOW FELL
1723-141149-0100 AS FAR AS WE COULD MAKE OUT HE SEEMED TO CONSIDER THE ELEMENTS THEMSELVES AS THE AVENGING AGENTS IT IS EVIDENT IN THIS CASE HOW NATURALLY IN A RACE A LITTLE MORE ADVANCED IN CULTURE THE ELEMENTS WOULD BECOME PERSONIFIED WHAT THE BAD WILD MEN WERE
1723-141149-0101 HAS ALWAYS APPEARED TO ME MOST MYSTERIOUS FROM WHAT YORK SAID WHEN WE FOUND THE PLACE LIKE THE FORM OF A HARE WHERE A SINGLE MAN HAD SLEPT THE NIGHT BEFORE
1723-141149-0102 BUT OTHER OBSCURE SPEECHES MADE ME DOUBT THIS I HAVE SOMETIMES IMAGINED THAT THE MOST PROBABLE EXPLANATION WAS THAT THEY WERE INSANE THE DIFFERENT TRIBES HAVE NO GOVERNMENT OR CHIEF YET EACH IS SURROUNDED BY OTHER HOSTILE TRIBES SPEAKING DIFFERENT DIALECTS
1723-141149-0103 AND SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER ONLY BY A DESERTED BORDER OR NEUTRAL TERRITORY THE CAUSE OF THEIR WARFARE APPEARS TO BE THE MEANS OF SUBSISTENCE THEIR COUNTRY IS A BROKEN MASS OF WILD ROCKS LOFTY HILLS AND USELESS FORESTS
1723-141149-0104 AND THESE ARE VIEWED THROUGH MISTS AND ENDLESS STORMS THE HABITABLE LAND IS REDUCED TO THE STONES ON THE BEACH IN SEARCH OF FOOD THEY ARE COMPELLED UNCEASINGLY TO WANDER FROM SPOT TO SPOT AND SO STEEP IS THE COAST THAT THEY CAN ONLY MOVE ABOUT IN THEIR WRETCHED CANOES
1723-141149-0105 THEY CANNOT KNOW THE FEELING OF HAVING A HOME AND STILL LESS THAT OF DOMESTIC AFFECTION FOR THE HUSBAND IS TO THE WIFE A BRUTAL MASTER TO A LABORIOUS SLAVE WAS A MORE HORRID DEED EVER PERPETRATED THAN THAT WITNESSED ON THE WEST COAST BY BYRON
1723-141149-0106 WHO SAW A WRETCHED MOTHER PICK UP HER BLEEDING DYING INFANT BOY WHOM HER HUSBAND HAD MERCILESSLY DASHED ON THE STONES FOR DROPPING A BASKET OF SEA EGGS HOW LITTLE CAN THE HIGHER POWERS OF THE MIND BE BROUGHT INTO PLAY WHAT IS THERE FOR IMAGINATION TO PICTURE
1723-141149-0107 FOR REASON TO COMPARE OR JUDGMENT TO DECIDE UPON TO KNOCK A LIMPET FROM THE ROCK DOES NOT REQUIRE EVEN CUNNING THAT LOWEST POWER OF THE MIND THEIR SKILL IN SOME RESPECTS MAY BE COMPARED TO THE INSTINCT OF ANIMALS FOR IT IS NOT IMPROVED BY EXPERIENCE
1723-141149-0108 THE CANOE THEIR MOST INGENIOUS WORK POOR AS IT IS HAS REMAINED THE SAME AS WE KNOW FROM DRAKE FOR THE LAST TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS WHILST BEHOLDING THESE SAVAGES ONE ASKS WHENCE HAVE THEY COME WHAT COULD HAVE TEMPTED
1723-141149-0109 OR WHAT CHANGE COMPELLED A TRIBE OF MEN TO LEAVE THE FINE REGIONS OF THE NORTH TO TRAVEL DOWN THE CORDILLERA OR BACKBONE OF AMERICA TO INVENT AND BUILD CANOES WHICH ARE NOT USED BY THE TRIBES OF CHILE PERU AND BRAZIL
1723-141149-0110 AND THEN TO ENTER ON ONE OF THE MOST INHOSPITABLE COUNTRIES WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE GLOBE ALTHOUGH SUCH REFLECTIONS MUST AT FIRST SEIZE ON THE MIND YET WE MAY FEEL SURE THAT THEY ARE PARTLY ERRONEOUS THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FUEGIANS DECREASE IN NUMBER
1723-141149-0111 THEREFORE WE MUST SUPPOSE THAT THEY ENJOY A SUFFICIENT SHARE OF HAPPINESS OF WHATEVER KIND IT MAY BE TO RENDER LIFE WORTH HAVING
1737-142396-0000 I CAN SEE NOW THAT TO CHILDREN WITH A PROPER EQUIPMENT OF PARENTS THESE THINGS WOULD HAVE WORN A DIFFERENT ASPECT BUT TO THOSE WHOSE NEAREST WERE AUNTS AND UNCLES A SPECIAL ATTITUDE OF MIND MAY BE ALLOWED THEY TREATED US INDEED WITH KINDNESS ENOUGH AS TO THE NEEDS OF THE FLESH
1737-142396-0001 WHILE THERE GREW UP IN ME AS IN THE PARALLEL CASE OF CALIBAN UPON SETEBOS A VAGUE SENSE OF A RULING POWER WILFUL AND FREAKISH AND PRONE TO THE PRACTICE OF VAGARIES JUST CHOOSING SO
1737-142396-0002 BUT ONLY A CERTAIN BLEND OF ENVY OF THEIR GOOD LUCK AND PITY FOR THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE USE OF IT INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST HOPELESS FEATURES IN THEIR CHARACTER WHEN WE TROUBLED OURSELVES TO WASTE A THOUGHT ON THEM WHICH WASN'T OFTEN
1737-142396-0003 THEY WERE FREE TO ISSUE FORTH AND BUY GUNPOWDER IN THE FULL EYE OF THE SUN FREE TO FIRE CANNONS AND EXPLODE MINES ON THE LAWN YET THEY NEVER DID ANY ONE OF THESE THINGS NO IRRESISTIBLE ENERGY HALED THEM TO CHURCH O SUNDAYS
1737-142396-0004 YET THEY WENT THERE REGULARLY OF THEIR OWN ACCORD THOUGH THEY BETRAYED NO GREATER DELIGHT IN THE EXPERIENCE THAN OURSELVES ON THE WHOLE THE EXISTENCE OF THESE OLYMPIANS SEEMED TO BE ENTIRELY VOID OF INTERESTS
1737-142396-0005 EVEN AS THEIR MOVEMENTS WERE CONFINED AND SLOW AND THEIR HABITS STEREOTYPED AND SENSELESS TO ANYTHING BUT APPEARANCES THEY WERE BLIND
1737-142396-0006 A PLACE ELF HAUNTED WONDERFUL SIMPLY PRODUCED SO MANY APPLES AND CHERRIES OR IT DIDN'T WHEN THE FAILURES OF NATURE WERE NOT INFREQUENTLY ASCRIBED TO US
1737-142396-0007 THOUGH THE WHOLE PLACE SWARMED WITH SUCH PORTENTS THEY CARED NOT ABOUT EXPLORING FOR ROBBERS CAVES NOR DIGGING FOR HIDDEN TREASURE PERHAPS INDEED IT WAS ONE OF THEIR BEST QUALITIES THAT THEY SPENT THE GREATER PART OF THEIR TIME STUFFILY INDOORS
1737-142396-0008 THERE WAS AN EXCEPTION IN THE CURATE WHO WOULD RECEIVE UNBLENCHING THE INFORMATION THAT THE MEADOW BEYOND THE ORCHARD WAS A PRAIRIE STUDDED WITH HERDS OF BUFFALO WHICH IT WAS OUR DELIGHT MOCCASINED AND TOMAHAWKED TO RIDE DOWN WITH THOSE WHOOPS THAT ANNOUNCE THE SCENTING OF BLOOD
1737-142396-0009 HE NEITHER LAUGHED NOR SNEERED AS THE OLYMPIANS WOULD HAVE DONE BUT POSSESSED OF A SERIOUS IDIOSYNCRASY HE WOULD CONTRIBUTE SUCH LOTS OF VALUABLE SUGGESTION
1737-142396-0010 THEN TOO HE WAS ALWAYS READY TO CONSTITUTE HIMSELF A HOSTILE ARMY OR A BAND OF MARAUDING INDIANS ON THE SHORTEST POSSIBLE NOTICE IN BRIEF A DISTINCTLY ABLE MAN WITH TALENTS SO FAR AS WE COULD JUDGE IMMENSELY ABOVE THE MAJORITY
1737-142396-0011 I TRUST HE IS A BISHOP BY THIS TIME HE HAD ALL THE NECESSARY QUALIFICATIONS AS WE KNEW THESE STRANGE FOLK HAD VISITORS SOMETIMES STIFF AND COLOURLESS OLYMPIANS LIKE THEMSELVES EQUALLY WITHOUT VITAL INTERESTS AND INTELLIGENT PURSUITS
1737-142396-0012 EMERGING OUT OF THE CLOUDS AND PASSING AWAY AGAIN TO DRAG ON AN AIMLESS EXISTENCE SOMEWHERE OUT OF OUR KEN THEN BRUTE FORCE WAS PITILESSLY APPLIED WE WERE CAPTURED WASHED AND FORCED INTO CLEAN COLLARS
1737-142396-0013 SILENTLY SUBMITTING AS WAS OUR WONT WITH MORE CONTEMPT THAN ANGER ANON WITH UNCTUOUS HAIR AND FACES STIFFENED IN A CONVENTIONAL GRIN
1737-142396-0014 HOW COULD REASONABLE PEOPLE SPEND THEIR PRECIOUS TIME SO
1737-142396-0015 OR TO HUNT BEARS AMONG THE HAZELS IT WAS INCESSANT MATTER FOR AMAZEMENT HOW THESE OLYMPIANS WOULD TALK OVER OUR HEADS DURING MEALS FOR INSTANCE OF THIS OR THE OTHER SOCIAL OR POLITICAL INANITY
1737-142396-0016 UNDER THE DELUSION THAT THESE PALE PHANTASMS OF REALITY WERE AMONG THE IMPORTANCES OF LIFE WE ILLUMINATI EATING SILENTLY OUR HEADS FULL OF PLANS AND CONSPIRACIES COULD HAVE TOLD THEM WHAT REAL LIFE WAS
1737-142396-0017 WE HAD JUST LEFT IT OUTSIDE AND WERE ALL ON FIRE TO GET BACK TO IT OF COURSE WE DIDN'T WASTE THE REVELATION ON THEM THE FUTILITY OF IMPARTING OUR IDEAS HAD LONG BEEN DEMONSTRATED ONE IN THOUGHT AND PURPOSE LINKED BY THE NECESSITY OF COMBATING ONE HOSTILE FATE
1737-142396-0018 THAN THE KINDLY BEASTS WHO SHARED OUR NATURAL EXISTENCE IN THE SUN THE ESTRANGEMENT WAS FORTIFIED BY AN ABIDING SENSE OF INJUSTICE
1737-142396-0019 OR ADMIT THEMSELVES IN THE WRONG OR TO ACCEPT SIMILAR CONCESSIONS ON OUR PART FOR INSTANCE WHEN I FLUNG THE CAT OUT OF AN UPPER WINDOW THOUGH I DID IT FROM NO ILL FEELING AND IT DIDN'T HURT THE CAT
1737-142396-0020 BUT WAS THE MATTER ALLOWED TO END THERE I TROW NOT AGAIN WHEN HAROLD WAS LOCKED UP IN HIS ROOM ALL DAY FOR ASSAULT AND BATTERY UPON A NEIGHBOUR'S PIG AN ACTION HE WOULD HAVE SCORNED BEING INDEED ON THE FRIENDLIEST TERMS WITH THE PORKER IN QUESTION
1737-142396-0021 THERE WAS NO HANDSOME EXPRESSION OF REGRET ON THE DISCOVERY OF THE REAL CULPRIT WHAT HAROLD HAD FELT WAS NOT SO MUCH THE IMPRISONMENT INDEED HE HAD VERY SOON ESCAPED BY THE WINDOW WITH ASSISTANCE FROM HIS ALLIES AND HAD ONLY GONE BACK IN TIME FOR HIS RELEASE AS THE OLYMPIAN HABIT
1737-142396-0022 WELL THE OLYMPIANS ARE ALL PAST AND GONE SOMEHOW THE SUN DOES NOT SEEM TO SHINE SO BRIGHTLY AS IT USED THE TRACKLESS MEADOWS OF OLD TIME HAVE SHRUNK AND DWINDLED AWAY TO A FEW POOR ACRES
1737-142396-0023 A SADDENING DOUBT A DULL SUSPICION CREEPS OVER ME ET IN ARCADIA EGO
1737-142397-0000 THE MASTERFUL WIND WAS UP AND OUT SHOUTING AND CHASING THE LORD OF THE MORNING POPLARS SWAYED AND TOSSED WITH A ROARING SWISH DEAD LEAVES SPRANG ALOFT AND WHIRLED INTO SPACE AND ALL THE CLEAR SWEPT HEAVEN SEEMED TO THRILL WITH SOUND LIKE A GREAT HARP
1737-142397-0001 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST AWAKENINGS OF THE YEAR THE EARTH STRETCHED HERSELF SMILING IN HER SLEEP AND EVERYTHING LEAPT AND PULSED TO THE STIR OF THE GIANT'S MOVEMENT WITH US IT WAS A WHOLE HOLIDAY THE OCCASION A BIRTHDAY IT MATTERS NOT WHOSE
1737-142397-0002 SOME ONE OF US HAD HAD PRESENTS AND PRETTY CONVENTIONAL SPEECHES AND HAD GLOWED WITH THAT SENSE OF HEROISM WHICH IS NO LESS SWEET THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO DESERVE IT BUT THE HOLIDAY WAS FOR ALL THE RAPTURE OF AWAKENING NATURE FOR ALL
1737-142397-0003 THE VARIOUS OUTDOOR JOYS OF PUDDLES AND SUN AND HEDGE BREAKING FOR ALL COLT LIKE I RAN THROUGH THE MEADOWS FRISKING HAPPY HEELS IN THE FACE OF NATURE LAUGHING RESPONSIVE ABOVE THE SKY WAS BLUEST OF THE BLUE WIDE POOLS LEFT BY THE WINTER'S FLOODS
1737-142397-0004 FLASHED THE COLOUR BACK TRUE AND BRILLIANT AND THE SOFT AIR THRILLED WITH THE GERMINATING TOUCH THAT SEEMED TO KINDLE SOMETHING IN MY OWN SMALL PERSON AS WELL AS IN THE RASH PRIMROSE ALREADY LURKING IN SHELTERED HAUNTS OUT INTO THE BRIMMING SUN BATHED WORLD I SPED FREE OF LESSONS
1737-142397-0005 OH HE'S JUST PLAYIN MUFFIN MAN AS USUAL SAID CHARLOTTE WITH PETULANCE FANCY WANTING TO BE A MUFFIN MAN ON A WHOLE HOLIDAY IT WAS A STRANGE CRAZE CERTAINLY BUT HAROLD WHO INVENTED HIS OWN GAMES AND PLAYED THEM WITHOUT ASSISTANCE
1737-142397-0006 ALWAYS STUCK STAUNCHLY TO A NEW FAD TILL HE HAD WORN IT QUITE OUT JUST AT PRESENT HE WAS A MUFFIN MAN
1737-142397-0007 AND OFFERING PHANTOM MUFFINS TO INVISIBLE WAYFARERS
1737-142397-0008 TO PASS ALONG BUSY STREETS OF YOUR OWN BUILDING FOR EVER RINGING AN IMAGINARY BELL AND OFFERING AIRY MUFFINS OF YOUR OWN MAKE TO A BUSTLING THRONGING CROWD OF YOUR OWN CREATION THERE WERE POINTS ABOUT THE GAME IT CANNOT BE DENIED THOUGH IT SEEMED SCARCE IN HARMONY WITH THIS RADIANT WIND SWEPT MORNING
1737-142397-0009 ONLY YOU MUSTN'T SAY I TOLD YOU COS IT'S TO BE A SURPRISE ALL RIGHT I SAID MAGNANIMOUSLY
1737-142397-0010 BUT I COULD NOT HELP FEELING THAT ON THIS DAY OF DAYS EVEN A GRIZZLY FELT MISPLACED AND COMMON SURE ENOUGH AN UNDENIABLE BEAR SPRANG OUT ON US AS WE DROPPED INTO THE ROAD THEN ENSUED SHRIEKS GROWLINGS REVOLVER SHOTS AND UNRECORDED HEROISMS
1737-142397-0011 AND THE AGE OF ACORNS HAVE DISPLACED OUR HARD WON CIVILISATION
1737-142397-0012 DO SHOUTED EDWARD VALIANTLY I SHOULD I SHOULD I SHOULD
1737-142397-0013 HE BEAT THE UNICORN OBSERVED HAROLD DUBIOUSLY ALL ROUND THE TOWN THAT PROVES HE WAS A GOOD LION CRIED EDWARDS TRIUMPHANTLY BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW ARE YOU TO TELL EM WHEN YOU SEE EM I SHOULD ASK MARTHA SAID HAROLD OF THE SIMPLE CREED
1737-142397-0014 AND I'LL RUN ON TO THAT CORNER AND BE A LION
1737-142397-0015 NO I WON'T I SWEAR I WON'T PROTESTED EDWARD I'LL BE QUITE A NEW LION THIS TIME SOMETHING YOU CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE AND HE RACED OFF TO HIS POST CHARLOTTE HESITATED THEN SHE WENT TIMIDLY ON
1737-142397-0016 AT EACH STEP GROWING LESS CHARLOTTE THE MUMMER OF A MINUTE AND MORE THE ANXIOUS PILGRIM OF ALL TIME THE LION'S WRATH WAXED TERRIBLE AT HER APPROACH HIS ROARING FILLED THE STARTLED AIR
1737-142397-0017 INTO THE VACANT MEADOW SPACES
1737-142397-0018 BUT THE PASSION AND THE CALL OF THE DIVINE MORNING WERE HIGH IN MY BLOOD EARTH TO EARTH THAT WAS THE FRANK NOTE THE JOYOUS SUMMONS OF THE DAY AND THEY COULD NOT BUT JAR AND SEEM ARTIFICIAL THESE HUMAN DISCUSSIONS AND PRETENCES
1737-142397-0019 THE PANT AND SMOKE OF A DISTANT TRAIN ALL WERE WINE OR SONG WAS IT OR ODOUR THIS UNITY THEY ALL BLENDED INTO I HAD NO WORDS THEN TO DESCRIBE IT THAT EARTH EFFLUENCE OF WHICH I WAS SO CONSCIOUS NOR INDEED HAVE I FOUND WORDS SINCE
1737-142397-0020 I RAN SIDEWAYS SHOUTING I DUG GLAD HEELS INTO THE SQUELCHING SOIL I SPLASHED DIAMOND SHOWERS FROM PUDDLES WITH A STICK I HURLED CLODS SKYWARDS AT RANDOM AND PRESENTLY I SOMEHOW FOUND MYSELF SINGING
1737-142397-0021 A WEARY UNRHYTHMIC THING OF RISE AND FALL AND YET IT SEEMED TO ME A GENUINE UTTERANCE AND JUST AT THAT MOMENT THE ONE THING FITTING AND RIGHT AND PERFECT HUMANITY WOULD HAVE REJECTED IT WITH SCORN NATURE EVERYWHERE SINGING IN THE SAME KEY
1737-142397-0022 RECOGNISED AND ACCEPTED IT WITHOUT A FLICKER OF DISSENT ALL THE TIME THE HEARTY WIND WAS CALLING TO ME COMPANIONABLY FROM WHERE HE SWUNG AND BELLOWED IN THE TREE TOPS
1737-142397-0023 A BELATED TRUANT YOU HAVE DRAGGED A WEARY FOOT HOMEWARD WITH ONLY A PALE EXPRESSIONLESS MOON FOR COMPANY TO DAY WHY NOT I THE TRICKSTER THE HYPOCRITE I WHO WHIP ROUND CORNERS AND BLUSTER RELAPSE AND EVADE THEN RALLY AND PURSUE
1737-142397-0024 I CAN LEAD YOU THE BEST AND RAREST DANCE OF ANY FOR I AM THE STRONG CAPRICIOUS ONE THE LORD OF MISRULE AND I ALONE AM IRRESPONSIBLE AND UNPRINCIPLED AND OBEY NO LAW AND FOR ME I WAS READY ENOUGH TO FALL IN WITH THE FELLOW'S HUMOUR WAS NOT THIS A WHOLE HOLIDAY
1737-142397-0025 SO WE SHEERED OFF TOGETHER ARM IN ARM SO TO SPEAK AND WITH FULLEST CONFIDENCE I TOOK THE JIGGING THWARTWISE COURSE MY CHAINLESS PILOT LAID FOR ME A WHIMSICAL COMRADE I FOUND HIM ERE HE HAD DONE WITH ME
1737-142397-0026 SILENT FACE TO FACE O'ER A DISCREET UNWINKING STILE AS A RULE THIS SORT OF THING STRUCK ME AS THE MOST PITIFUL TOMFOOLERY TWO CALVES RUBBING NOSES THROUGH A GATE WERE NATURAL AND RIGHT AND WITHIN THE ORDER OF THINGS BUT THAT HUMAN BEINGS
1737-142397-0027 WITH SALIENT INTERESTS AND ACTIVE PURSUITS BECKONING THEM ON FROM EVERY SIDE COULD THUS
1737-142397-0028 AND IT WAS WITH A CERTAIN SURPRISE THAT I FOUND MYSELF REGARDING THESE FATUOUS ONES WITH KINDLINESS INSTEAD OF CONTEMPT AS I RAMBLED BY UNHEEDED OF THEM THERE WAS INDEED SOME RECONCILING INFLUENCE ABROAD WHICH COULD BRING THE LIKE ANTICS INTO HARMONY WITH BUD AND GROWTH AND THE FROLIC AIR
1737-142397-0029 AND PRESENTLY I CAME IN SIGHT OF THE VILLAGE CHURCH SITTING SOLITARY WITHIN ITS CIRCLE OF ELMS FROM FORTH THE VESTRY WINDOW PROJECTED TWO SMALL LEGS GYRATING HUNGRY FOR FOOTHOLD WITH LARCENY
1737-142397-0030 BILL'S COVETED BOOTY TOO I COULD EASILY GUESS AT THAT IT CAME FROM THE VICAR'S STORE OF BISCUITS KEPT AS I KNEW
1737-142397-0031 THEN I PASSED ON MY WAY I PROTEST I WAS NOT ON BILL'S SIDE BUT THEN NEITHER WAS I ON THE VICAR'S
1737-142397-0032 AND I FELT SURE AS I RAMBLED OFF IN HIS WAKE THAT HE HAD MORE HOLIDAY MATTER TO SHOW ME AND SO INDEED HE HAD AND ALL OF IT WAS TO THE SAME LAWLESS TUNE LIKE A BLACK PIRATE FLAG ON THE BLUE OCEAN OF AIR A HAWK HUNG OMINOUS THEN PLUMMET WISE DROPPED TO THE HEDGEROW
1737-142397-0033 WHENCE THERE ROSE THIN AND SHRILL A PITEOUS VOICE OF SQUEALING BY THE TIME I GOT THERE A WHISK OF FEATHERS ON THE TURF LIKE SCATTERED PLAYBILLS WAS ALL THAT REMAINED TO TELL OF THE TRAGEDY JUST ENACTED YET NATURE SMILED AND SANG ON PITILESS GAY IMPARTIAL
1737-142397-0034 TO HER WHO TOOK NO SIDES THERE WAS EVERY BIT AS MUCH TO BE SAID FOR THE HAWK AS FOR THE CHAFFINCH BOTH WERE HER CHILDREN AND SHE WOULD SHOW NO PREFERENCES FURTHER ON A HEDGEHOG LAY DEAD ATHWART THE PATH NAY MORE THAN DEAD DECADENT DISTINCTLY
1737-142397-0035 A SORRY SIGHT FOR ONE THAT HAD KNOWN THE FELLOW IN MORE BUSTLING CIRCUMSTANCES NATURE MIGHT AT LEAST HAVE PAUSED TO SHED ONE TEAR OVER THIS ROUGH JACKETED LITTLE SON OF HERS FOR HIS WASTED AIMS HIS CANCELLED AMBITIONS HIS WHOLE CAREER OF USEFULNESS CUT SUDDENLY SHORT BUT NOT A BIT OF IT
1737-142397-0036 JUBILANT AS EVER HER SONG WENT BUBBLING ON AND DEATH IN LIFE AND AGAIN LIFE IN DEATH WERE ITS ALTERNATE BURDENS AND LOOKING ROUND AND SEEING THE SHEEP NIBBLED HEELS OF TURNIPS THAT DOTTED THE GROUND THEIR HEARTS EATEN OUT OF THEM IN FROST BOUND DAYS NOW OVER AND DONE
1737-142397-0037 I SEEMED TO DISCERN FAINTLY A SOMETHING OF THE STERN MEANING IN HER VALOROUS CHANT MY INVISIBLE COMPANION WAS SINGING ALSO AND SEEMED AT TIMES TO BE CHUCKLING SOFTLY TO HIMSELF DOUBTLESS AT THOUGHT OF THE STRANGE NEW LESSONS HE WAS TEACHING ME
1737-142397-0038 PERHAPS TOO AT A SPECIAL BIT OF WAGGISHNESS HE HAD STILL IN STORE FOR WHEN AT LAST HE GREW WEARY OF SUCH INSIGNIFICANT EARTHBOUND COMPANY HE DESERTED ME AT A CERTAIN SPOT I KNEW THEN DROPPED SUBSIDED AND SLUNK AWAY INTO NOTHINGNESS
1737-142397-0039 STOOD THE ANCIENT WHIPPING POST OF THE VILLAGE ITS SIDES FRETTED WITH THE INITIALS OF A GENERATION THAT SCORNED ITS MUTE LESSON BUT STILL CLIPPED BY THE STOUT RUSTY SHACKLES THAT HAD TETHERED THE WRISTS
1737-142397-0040 HAD I BEEN AN INFANT STERNE HERE WAS A GRAND CHANCE FOR SENTIMENTAL OUTPUT AS THINGS WERE I COULD ONLY HURRY HOMEWARDS MY MORAL TAIL WELL BETWEEN MY LEGS WITH AN UNEASY FEELING AS I GLANCED BACK OVER MY SHOULDER THAT THERE WAS MORE IN THIS CHANCE THAN MET THE EYE
1737-142397-0041 HAROLD IT FURTHER APPEARED GREATLY COVETING TADPOLES AND TOP HEAVY WITH THE EAGERNESS OF POSSESSION HAD FALLEN INTO THE POND THIS IN ITSELF WAS NOTHING BUT ON ATTEMPTING TO SNEAK IN
1737-142397-0042 BY THE BACK DOOR HE HAD RENDERED UP HIS DUCKWEED BEDABBLED PERSON INTO THE HANDS OF AN AUNT AND HAD BEEN PROMPTLY SENT OFF TO BED AND THIS ON A HOLIDAY WAS VERY MUCH

1737-148989-0001 SAID PROFESSOR BHAER COMING IN ONE DAY EARLY IN JANUARY PLEASE TELL IT AT ONCE I CAN'T BEAR TO WAIT FRITZ CRIED MISSUS JO DROPPING HER WORK AND STANDING UP AS IF TO TAKE THE SHOT BRAVELY BUT WE MUST WAIT AND HOPE HEART'S DEAREST COME
1737-148989-0002 AND LET US BEAR IT TOGETHER EMIL'S SHIP IS LOST AND AS YET NO NEWS OF HIM IT WAS WELL MISTER BHAER HAD TAKEN HIS WIFE INTO HIS STRONG ARMS FOR SHE LOOKED READY TO DROP BUT BORE UP AFTER A MOMENT
1737-148989-0003 AND SITTING BY HER GOOD MAN HEARD ALL THAT THERE WAS TO TELL TIDINGS HAD BEEN SENT TO THE SHIPOWNERS AT HAMBURG BY SOME OF THE SURVIVORS AND TELEGRAPHED AT ONCE BY FRANZ TO HIS UNCLE AS ONE BOAT LOAD WAS SAFE
1737-148989-0004 THERE WAS HOPE THAT OTHERS MIGHT ALSO ESCAPE THOUGH THE GALE HAD SENT TWO TO THE BOTTOM A SWIFT SAILING STEAMER HAD BROUGHT THESE SCANTY NEWS AND HAPPIER ONES MIGHT COME AT ANY HOUR BUT KIND FRANZ HAD NOT ADDED THAT THE SAILORS REPORTED THE CAPTAIN'S BOAT AS UNDOUBTEDLY WRECKED BY THE FALLING MAST
1737-148989-0005 EVEN WHEN HOPE WAXED FAINT AND HER HEART WAS HEAVY IF ANYTHING COULD COMFORT THE BHAERS FOR THE LOSS OF ONE BOY
1737-148989-0006 FRANZ KEPT THE CABLE BUSY WITH HIS VARYING MESSAGES NAT SENT LOVING LETTERS FROM LEIPZIG AND TOM HARASSED THE SHIPPING AGENTS FOR NEWS EVEN BUSY JACK WROTE THEM WITH UNUSUAL WARMTH
1737-148989-0007 DOLLY AND GEORGE CAME OFTEN BEARING THE LOVELIEST FLOWERS AND THE DAINTIEST BON BONS TO CHEER MISSUS BHAER AND SWEETEN JOSIE'S GRIEF WHILE GOOD HEARTED NED TRAVELLED ALL THE WAY FROM CHICAGO TO PRESS THEIR HANDS AND SAY WITH A TEAR IN HIS EYE
1737-148989-0008 I WAS SO ANXIOUS TO HEAR ALL ABOUT THE DEAR OLD BOY I COULDN'T KEEP AWAY THAT'S RIGHT COMFORTABLE AND SHOWS ME THAT IF I DIDN'T TEACH MY BOYS ANYTHING ELSE I DID GIVE THEM THE BROTHERLY LOVE THAT WILL MAKE THEM STAND BY ONE ANOTHER ALL THEIR LIVES SAID MISSUS JO WHEN HE HAD GONE
1737-148989-0009 HAD THEY ALL BEEN TRUE THE ELDERS BORE IT QUIETLY HAVING LEARNED SUBMISSION IN LIFE'S HARD SCHOOL BUT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE REBELLED SOME HOPED AGAINST HOPE AND KEPT UP OTHERS DESPAIRED AT ONCE AND LITTLE JOSIE EMIL'S PET COUSIN AND PLAYMATE WAS SO BROKEN HEARTED
1737-148989-0010 NOTHING COULD COMFORT HER NAN DOSED IN VAIN DAISY'S CHEERFUL WORDS WENT BY LIKE THE WIND AND BESS'S DEVICES TO AMUSE HER ALL FAILED UTTERLY TO CRY IN MOTHER'S ARMS AND TALK ABOUT THE WRECK WHICH HAUNTED HER EVEN IN HER SLEEP WAS ALL SHE CARED TO DO
1737-148989-0011 AND MISSUS MEG WAS GETTING ANXIOUS WHEN MISS CAMERON SENT JOSIE A KIND NOTE
1737-148989-0012 AND BE LIKE THE SELF SACRIFICING HEROINES SHE LOVED TO ACT
1737-148989-0013 FOR THE BOY WAS DEEPLY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUDDEN ECLIPSE OF THE FIREFLY WHOSE LIGHT AND LIFE ALL MISSED WHEN THEY WERE GONE AND LURED HER OUT EVERY DAY FOR LONG DRIVES BEHIND THE BLACK MARE WHO SHOOK HER SILVERY BELLS TILL THEY MADE SUCH MERRY MUSIC JOSIE COULD NOT HELP LISTENING TO IT
1737-148989-0014 AND WHISKED HER OVER THE SNOWY ROADS AT A PACE WHICH SET THE BLOOD DANCING IN HER VEINS AND SENT HER HOME STRENGTHENED AND COMFORTED BY SUNSHINE FRESH AIR AND CONGENIAL SOCIETY THREE AIDS YOUNG SUFFERERS SELDOM CAN RESIST
1737-148989-0015 SOME REGRET FOR FAULTS THAT LIE HEAVY ON THE CONSCIENCE WHEN THE ONE SINNED AGAINST IS GONE AND ALL OF THEM THE SOLEMN LESSON TO BE READY WHEN THE SUMMONS COMES A HUSH LAY OVER PLUMFIELD FOR WEEKS AND THE STUDIOUS FACES ON THE HILL REFLECTED THE SADNESS OF THOSE IN THE VALLEY
1737-148989-0016 THEN UP WENT THE FLAG OUT RANG THE COLLEGE BELLS BANG WENT TEDDY'S LONG UNUSED CANNON AND A CHORUS OF HAPPY VOICES CRIED THANK GOD AS PEOPLE WENT ABOUT LAUGHING CRYING AND EMBRACING ONE ANOTHER IN A RAPTURE OF DELIGHT
1737-148989-0017 FOR MISSUS JO CARRIED THEM IN HER POCKET WHEN MISTER BHAER DID NOT HAVE THEM IN HIS AND BOTH TOOK A LOOK AT THEM WHEN THEY SAID THEIR PRAYERS AT NIGHT NOW THE PROFESSOR WAS HEARD HUMMING LIKE A BIG BEE AGAIN AS HE WENT TO HIS CLASSES
1737-148989-0018 AND LET HER ROMANCES WAIT NOW MESSAGES OF CONGRATULATION FLOWED IN AND BEAMING FACES SHOWED EVERYWHERE ROB AMAZED HIS PARENTS BY PRODUCING A POEM WHICH WAS REMARKABLY GOOD FOR ONE OF HIS YEARS AND DEMI SET IT TO MUSIC THAT IT MIGHT BE SUNG WHEN THE SAILOR BOY RETURNED
1737-148989-0019 TEDDY STOOD ON HIS HEAD LITERALLY AND TORE ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURHOOD ON OCTOO LIKE A SECOND PAUL REVERE ONLY HIS TIDINGS WERE GOOD BUT BEST OF ALL LITTLE JOSIE LIFTED UP HER HEAD AS THE SNOWDROPS DID AND BEGAN TO BLOOM AGAIN GROWING TALL AND QUIET
1737-148989-0020 WITH THE SHADOW OF PAST SORROW TO TONE DOWN HER FORMER VIVACITY AND SHOW THAT SHE HAD LEARNED A LESSON IN TRYING TO ACT WELL HER PART ON THE REAL STAGE WHERE ALL HAVE TO TAKE THEIR SHARE IN THE GREAT DRAMA OF LIFE
1737-148989-0021 THERE WAS GREAT SCRUBBING AND DUSTING AMONG THE MATRONS AS THEY SET THEIR HOUSES IN ORDER NOT ONLY FOR CLASS DAY BUT TO RECEIVE THE BRIDE AND GROOM WHO WERE TO COME TO THEM FOR THE HONEYMOON TRIP GREAT PLANS WERE MADE GIFTS PREPARED AND MUCH JOY FELT AT THE PROSPECT OF SEEING FRANZ AGAIN
1737-148989-0022 THOUGH EMIL WHO WAS TO ACCOMPANY THEM WOULD BE THE GREATER HERO LITTLE DID THE DEAR SOULS DREAM WHAT A SURPRISE WAS IN STORE FOR THEM AS THEY INNOCENTLY LAID THEIR PLANS AND WISHED ALL THE BOYS COULD BE THERE TO WELCOME HOME THEIR ELDEST AND THEIR CASABLANCA
1737-148989-0023 WHILE THEY WAIT AND WORK SO HAPPILY LET US SEE HOW OUR OTHER ABSENT BOYS ARE FARING AS THEY TOO WAIT AND WORK AND HOPE FOR BETTER DAYS NAT WAS TOILING STEADILY ALONG THE PATH HE HAD WISELY CHOSEN THOUGH IT WAS BY NO MEANS STREWN WITH FLOWERS
1737-148989-0024 QUITE THORNY WAS IT IN FACT AND HARD TO TRAVEL AFTER THE TASTE OF EASE AND PLEASURE HE HAD GOT WHEN NIBBLING AT FORBIDDEN FRUIT BUT HIS CROP OF WILD OATS WAS A LIGHT ONE AND HE RESOLUTELY REAPED WHAT HE HAD SOWED FINDING SOME GOOD WHEAT AMONG THE TARES HE TAUGHT BY DAY
1737-148989-0025 HE FIDDLED NIGHT AFTER NIGHT IN THE DINGY LITTLE THEATRE AND HE STUDIED SO DILIGENTLY THAT HIS MASTER WAS WELL PLEASED AND KEPT HIM IN MIND AS ONE TO WHOM PREFERMENT WAS DUE IF ANY CHANCE OCCURRED GAY FRIENDS FORGOT HIM BUT THE OLD ONES STOOD FAST
1737-148989-0026 AND CHEERED HIM UP WHEN HEIMWEH AND WEARINESS MADE HIM SAD AS SPRING CAME ON THINGS MENDED EXPENSES GREW LESS WORK PLEASANTER AND LIFE MORE BEARABLE THAN WHEN WINTRY STORMS BEAT ON HIS THINLY CLAD BACK
1737-148989-0027 AND FROST PINCHED THE TOES THAT PATIENTLY TRUDGED IN OLD BOOTS NO DEBTS BURDENED HIM THE YEAR OF ABSENCE WAS NEARLY OVER AND IF HE CHOSE TO STAY HERR BERGMANN HAD HOPES FOR HIM THAT WOULD BRING INDEPENDENCE FOR A TIME AT LEAST
1737-148989-0028 SO HE WALKED UNDER THE LINDENS WITH A LIGHTER HEART AND IN THE MAY EVENINGS WENT ABOUT THE CITY WITH A BAND OF STROLLING STUDENTS MAKING MUSIC BEFORE HOUSES WHERE HE USED TO SIT AS GUEST
1737-148989-0029 AND ONCE MINNA THREW HIM MONEY WHICH HE HUMBLY RECEIVED AS PART OF HIS PENANCE BEING MORBID ON THE SUBJECT OF HIS SINS HIS REWARD CAME SOONER THAN HE EXPECTED AND WAS GREATER THAN HE DESERVED HE THOUGHT THOUGH HIS HEART LEAPED WITH JOY WHEN HIS MASTER ONE DAY INFORMED HIM
1737-148989-0030 THAT HE WAS CHOSEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER OF HIS MOST PROMISING PUPILS TO JOIN THE MUSICAL SOCIETY WHICH WAS TO TAKE PART IN THE GREAT FESTIVAL IN LONDON THE NEXT JULY HERE WAS NOT ONLY HONOUR FOR THE VIOLINIST BUT HAPPINESS FOR THE MAN AS IT BROUGHT HIM NEARER HOME
1737-148989-0031 AS THE GREAT BERGMANN SELDOM PRAISED HIS PUPILS THESE WORDS FILLED NAT'S SOUL WITH PRIDE AND JOY AND HE WORKED YET MORE DILIGENTLY THAN BEFORE TO FULFIL HIS MASTER'S PROPHECY HE THOUGHT THE TRIP TO ENGLAND HAPPINESS ENOUGH BUT FOUND ROOM FOR MORE WHEN EARLY IN JUNE
1737-148989-0032 KIND WISHES AND COMFORTABLE GIFTS FOR THE LONELY FELLOW WHO COULD HAVE FALLEN ON THEIR NECKS AND CRIED LIKE A GIRL AT SEEING HIS OLD MATES AGAIN HOW GLAD HE WAS TO BE FOUND IN HIS LITTLE ROOM BUSY AT HIS PROPER WORK NOT LIVING LIKE AN IDLE GENTLEMAN ON BORROWED MONEY
1737-148989-0033 HOW PROUD HE WAS TO TELL HIS PLANS ASSURE THEM THAT HE HAD NO DEBTS AND RECEIVE THEIR PRAISES FOR HIS IMPROVEMENT IN MUSIC THEIR RESPECT FOR HIS ECONOMY AND STEADFASTNESS IN WELL DOING
1737-148989-0034 HOW RELIEVED WHEN HAVING HONESTLY CONFESSED HIS SHORTCOMINGS THEY ONLY LAUGHED AND OWNED THAT THEY ALSO HAD KNOWN LIKE EXPERIENCES AND WERE THE WISER FOR THEM HE WAS TO GO TO THE WEDDING LATE IN JUNE AND JOIN HIS COMRADES IN LONDON
1737-148989-0035 AS BEST MAN HE COULD NOT REFUSE THE NEW SUIT FRANZ INSISTED ON ORDERING FOR HIM AND A CHEQUE FROM HOME ABOUT THAT TIME MADE HIM FEEL LIKE A MILLIONAIRE AND A HAPPY ONE FOR THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH KIND LETTERS FULL OF DELIGHT IN HIS SUCCESS
1737-148989-0036 HE HAD FOUND THE LITTLE GUIDE BOOK THAT CHRISTIAN CARRIED IN HIS BOSOM AND LOVE PENITENCE AND PRAYER THE THREE SWEET SISTERS HAD GIVEN HIM THE ARMOUR WHICH WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE HE HAD NOT LEARNED TO WEAR IT YET AND CHAFED AGAINST IT THOUGH HE FELT ITS VALUE
1737-148989-0037 THANKS TO THE FAITHFUL FRIEND WHO HAD STOOD BY HIM ALL THAT BITTER YEAR SOON HE WAS TO BE FREE AGAIN WORN AND SCARRED IN THE FRAY
1737-148989-0038 WHEN HE THOUGHT OF IT DAN FELT AS IF HE COULD NOT WAIT BUT MUST BURST THAT NARROW CELL AND FLY AWAY AS THE CADDIS WORMS HE USED TO WATCH BY THE BROOKSIDE SHED THEIR STONY COFFINS TO CLIMB THE FERNS AND SOAR INTO THE SKY NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HE LULLED HIMSELF TO SLEEP WITH PLANNING HOW
1737-148989-0039 AND THE OLD FREE LIFE WOULD KEEP HIM SAFE FROM THE TEMPTATIONS THAT BESET HIM IN CITIES BY AND BY WHEN I'M ALL RIGHT AGAIN AND HAVE SOMETHING TO TELL THAT I'M NOT ASHAMED OF I'LL GO HOME HE SAID WITH A QUICKER BEAT OF THE IMPETUOUS HEART THAT LONGED TO BE THERE SO INTENSELY
1737-148989-0040 AS HE REMEMBERED WHAT IT HAD DONE SINCE A CERTAIN LITTLE WHITE HAND HAD LAID IN IT CONFIDINGLY I'LL MAKE EM PROUD OF ME YET AND NO ONE SHALL EVER KNOW OF THIS AWFUL YEAR I CAN WIPE IT OUT AND I WILL SO HELP ME GOD
1743-142912-0000 AND NOW OUR FAMILY IS VERY WELL REPRESENTED IN THE OLD ORCHARD SAID CHEBEC PROUDLY SLOWLY PETER REACHED OVER HIS BACK WITH HIS LONG LEFT HIND FOOT AND THOUGHTFULLY SCRATCHED HIS LONG RIGHT EAR
1743-142912-0001 HE DIDN'T LIKE TO ADMIT THAT HE COULDN'T RECALL THOSE TWO COUSINS OF CHEBEC'S DID YOU SAY YOUR FIGHTING COUSIN HE ASKED IN A HESITATING WAY THAT'S WHAT I SAID REPLIED CHEBEC HE IS SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD AS OF COURSE YOU KNOW
1743-142912-0002 THE REST OF US ALWAYS FEEL SAFE WHEN HE IS ABOUT OF COURSE I KNOW HIM DECLARED PETER HIS FACE CLEARING WHERE IS HE NOW
1743-142912-0003 AT THAT VERY INSTANT A GREAT RACKET BROKE OUT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE OLD ORCHARD AND IN NO TIME AT ALL THE FEATHERED FOLKS WERE HURRYING FROM EVERY DIRECTION SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF THEIR VOICES
1743-142912-0004 OF COURSE PETER COULDN'T BE LEFT OUT OF ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND HE SCAMPERED FOR THE SCENE OF TROUBLE AS FAST AS HIS LEGS COULD TAKE HIM
1743-142912-0005 AND THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AS IF TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM SOMETHING OR SOMEBODY FOR A MINUTE PETER COULDN'T THINK WHAT WAS THE TROUBLE WITH REDTAIL AND THEN HE SAW
1743-142912-0006 A WHITE THROATED WHITE BREASTED BIRD HAVING A BLACK CAP AND BACK AND A BROAD WHITE BAND ACROSS THE END OF HIS TAIL WAS DARTING AT REDTAIL AS IF HE MEANT TO PULL OUT EVERY FEATHER IN THE LATTER'S COAT
1743-142912-0007 HE WAS JUST A LITTLE SMALLER THAN WELCOME ROBIN AND IN COMPARISON WITH HIM REDTAIL WAS A PERFECT GIANT BUT THIS SEEMED TO MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO SCRAPPER FOR THAT IS WHO IT WAS
1743-142912-0008 HE WASN'T AFRAID AND HE INTENDED THAT EVERYBODY SHOULD KNOW IT ESPECIALLY REDTAIL IT IS BECAUSE OF HIS FEARLESSNESS THAT HE IS CALLED KINGBIRD ALL THE TIME HE WAS SCREAMING AT THE TOP OF HIS LUNGS CALLING REDTAIL A ROBBER AND EVERY OTHER BAD NAME HE COULD THINK OF
1743-142912-0009 ALL THE OTHER BIRDS JOINED HIM IN CALLING REDTAIL BAD NAMES BUT NONE NOT EVEN BULLY THE ENGLISH SPARROW WAS BRAVE ENOUGH TO JOIN HIM IN ATTACKING BIG REDTAIL WHEN HE HAD SUCCEEDED IN DRIVING REDTAIL FAR ENOUGH FROM THE OLD ORCHARD TO SUIT HIM
1743-142912-0010 SCRAPPER FLEW BACK AND PERCHED ON A DEAD BRANCH OF ONE OF THE TREES WHERE HE RECEIVED THE CONGRATULATIONS OF ALL HIS FEATHERED NEIGHBORS HE TOOK THEM QUITE MODESTLY ASSURING THEM THAT HE HAD DONE NOTHING
1743-142912-0011 PETER COULDN'T HELP BUT ADMIRE SCRAPPER FOR HIS COURAGE AS PETER LOOKED UP AT SCRAPPER HE SAW THAT LIKE ALL THE REST OF THE FLYCATCHERS THERE WAS JUST THE TINIEST OF HOOKS ON THE END OF HIS BILL
1743-142912-0012 SCRAPPER'S SLIGHTLY RAISED CAP SEEMED ALL BLACK BUT IF PETER COULD HAVE GOTTEN CLOSE ENOUGH HE WOULD HAVE FOUND THAT HIDDEN IN IT WAS A PATCH OF ORANGE RED WHILE PETER SAT STARING UP AT HIM SCRAPPER SUDDENLY DARTED OUT INTO THE AIR
1743-142912-0013 AND HIS BILL SNAPPED IN QUITE THE SAME WAY CHEBEC'S DID WHEN HE CAUGHT A FLY BUT IT WASN'T A FLY THAT SCRAPPER HAD IT WAS A BEE PETER SAW IT VERY DISTINCTLY JUST AS SCRAPPER SNAPPED IT UP
1743-142912-0014 IT REMINDED PETER THAT HE HAD OFTEN HEARD SCRAPPER CALLED THE BEE MARTIN AND NOW HE UNDERSTOOD WHY DO YOU LIVE ON BEES ALTOGETHER ASKED PETER
1743-142912-0015 THERE WOULDN'T BE ANY HONEY IF I DID
1743-142912-0016 THOSE THAT I DO CATCH ARE MOSTLY DRONES AND YOU KNOW THE DRONES ARE USELESS THEY DO NO WORK AT ALL IT IS ONLY BY ACCIDENT THAT I NOW AND THEN CATCH A WORKER I EAT ALL KINDS OF INSECTS THAT FLY AND SOME THAT DON'T
1743-142912-0017 I'M ONE OF FARMER BROWN'S BEST FRIENDS IF HE DID BUT KNOW IT YOU CAN TALK ALL YOU PLEASE ABOUT THE WONDERFUL EYESIGHT OF THE MEMBERS OF THE HAWK FAMILY BUT IF ANY ONE OF THEM HAS BETTER EYESIGHT THAN I HAVE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHO IT IS
1743-142912-0018 THERE'S A FLY WAY OVER THERE BEYOND THAT OLD APPLE TREE WATCH ME CATCH IT PETER KNEW BETTER THAN TO WASTE ANY EFFORT TRYING TO SEE THAT FLY HE KNEW THAT HE COULDN'T HAVE SEEN IT HAD IT BEEN ONLY ONE FOURTH THAT DISTANCE AWAY
1743-142912-0019 BUT IF HE COULDN'T SEE THE FLY HE COULD HEAR THE SHARP CLICK OF SCRAPPER'S BILL AND HE KNEW BY THE WAY SCRAPPER KEPT OPENING AND SHUTTING HIS MOUTH AFTER HIS RETURN THAT HE HAD CAUGHT THAT FLY AND IT HAD TASTED GOOD
1743-142912-0020 ARE YOU GOING TO BUILD IN THE OLD ORCHARD THIS YEAR ASKED PETER OF COURSE I AM DECLARED SCRAPPER I JUST THEN HE SPIED BLACKY THE CROW AND DASHED OUT TO MEET HIM
1743-142912-0021 TURNING AWAY TOWARD THE GREEN MEADOWS INSTEAD PETER DIDN'T WAIT FOR SCRAPPER TO RETURN
1743-142912-0022 JUST AS HE WAS LEAVING THE FAR CORNER OF THE OLD ORCHARD SOME ONE CALLED HIM PETER OH PETER RABBIT CALLED THE VOICE PETER STOPPED ABRUPTLY SAT UP VERY STRAIGHT LOOKED THIS WAY LOOKED THAT WAY AND LOOKED THE OTHER WAY
1743-142912-0023 EVERY WAY BUT THE RIGHT WAY LOOK UP OVER YOUR HEAD CRIED THE VOICE RATHER A HARSH VOICE
1743-142912-0024 IT WAS CRESTY THE GREAT CRESTED FLYCATCHER HE WAS A WEE BIT BIGGER THAN SCRAPPER THE KINGBIRD YET NOT QUITE SO BIG AS WELCOME ROBIN AND MORE SLENDER
1743-142912-0025 HIS THROAT AND BREAST WERE GRAY SHADING INTO BRIGHT YELLOW UNDERNEATH HIS BACK AND HEAD WERE OF A GRAYISH BROWN WITH A TINT OF OLIVE GREEN A POINTED CAP WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED TO MAKE HIM QUITE DISTINGUISHED LOOKING
1743-142912-0026 YOU SEEM TO BE IN A HURRY SO DON'T LET ME DETAIN YOU PETER SAID CRESTY BEFORE PETER COULD FIND HIS TONGUE I JUST WANT TO ASK ONE LITTLE FAVOR OF YOU WHAT IS IT ASKED PETER WHO
1743-142912-0027 IF IN YOUR ROAMING ABOUT YOU RUN ACROSS AN OLD CAST OFF SUIT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE OR OF ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THE SNAKE FAMILY I WISH YOU WOULD REMEMBER ME AND LET ME KNOW WILL YOU PETER SAID CRESTY A A

1743-142912-0029 CAST OFF SNAKE SUITS BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD CRESTY HAD FLOWN AWAY PETER HESITATED LOOKING FIRST TOWARDS THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH AND THEN TOWARDS JENNY WREN'S HOUSE
1743-142912-0030 HE JUST COULDN'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT THOSE CAST OFF SUITS OF THE SNAKE FAMILY AND HE FELT SURE THAT JENNY WREN COULD TELL HIM FINALLY CURIOSITY GOT THE BEST OF HIM AND BACK HE SCAMPERED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP TO THE FOOT OF THE TREE IN WHICH JENNY WREN HAD HER HOME
1743-142912-0031 JENNY CALLED PETER JENNY WREN JENNY WREN NO ONE ANSWERED HIM HE COULD HEAR MISTER WREN SINGING IN ANOTHER TREE BUT HE COULDN'T SEE HIM JENNY JENNY WREN JENNY WREN CALLED PETER AGAIN
1743-142912-0032 THIS TIME JENNY POPPED HER HEAD OUT AND HER LITTLE EYES FAIRLY SNAPPED DIDN'T I TELL YOU THE OTHER DAY PETER RABBIT THAT I'M NOT TO BE DISTURBED DIDN'T I TELL YOU THAT I'VE GOT SEVEN EGGS IN HERE AND THAT I CAN'T SPEND ANY TIME GOSSIPING
1743-142912-0033 DIDN'T I PETER RABBIT DIDN'T I DIDN'T I YOU CERTAINLY DID JENNY YOU CERTAINLY DID AND I'M SORRY TO DISTURB YOU REPLIED PETER MEEKLY I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT OF DOING SUCH A THING BUT I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHO ELSE TO GO TO
1743-142912-0034 GO TO FOR WHAT SNAPPED JENNY WREN WHAT IS IT YOU'VE COME TO ME FOR SNAKE SKINS REPLIED PETER SNAKE SKINS SNAKE SKINS SHRIEKED JENNY WREN
1743-142912-0035 YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND CRIED PETER HURRIEDLY WHAT I WANT TO KNOW IS WHY SHOULD CRESTY THE FLYCATCHER ASK ME TO PLEASE LET HIM KNOW IF I FOUND ANY CAST OFF SUITS OF THE SNAKE FAMILY
1743-142912-0036 HE FLEW AWAY BEFORE I COULD ASK HIM WHY HE WANTS THEM AND SO I CAME TO YOU BECAUSE I KNOW YOU KNOW EVERYTHING ESPECIALLY EVERYTHING CONCERNING YOUR NEIGHBORS
1743-142913-0000 WITH THIS JENNY WREN DISAPPEARED INSIDE HER HOUSE AND THERE WAS NOTHING FOR PETER TO DO BUT ONCE MORE START FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH ON HIS WAY HE COULDN'T RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO RUN OVER TO THE GREEN FOREST WHICH WAS JUST BEYOND THE OLD ORCHARD
1743-142913-0001 HE JUST HAD TO FIND OUT IF THERE WAS ANYTHING NEW OVER THERE HARDLY HAD HE REACHED IT WHEN HE HEARD A PLAINTIVE VOICE CRYING PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE PETER CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0002 HE USUALLY IS ONE OF THE LAST OF THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY TO ARRIVE I DIDN'T EXPECT TO FIND HIM YET I WONDER WHAT HAS BROUGHT HIM UP SO EARLY
1743-142913-0003 IT DIDN'T TAKE PETER LONG TO FIND PEWEE HE JUST FOLLOWED THE SOUND OF THAT VOICE AND PRESENTLY SAW PEWEE FLY OUT AND MAKE THE SAME KIND OF A LITTLE CIRCLE AS THE OTHER MEMBERS OF THE FAMILY MAKE WHEN THEY ARE HUNTING FLIES
1743-142913-0004 IT ENDED JUST WHERE IT HAD STARTED ON A DEAD TWIG OF A TREE IN A SHADY RATHER LONELY PART OF THE GREEN FOREST ALMOST AT ONCE HE BEGAN TO CALL HIS NAME IN A RATHER SAD PLAINTIVE TONE PEE WEE PEE WEE PEE WEE
1743-142913-0005 BUT HE WASN'T SAD AS PETER WELL KNEW IT WAS HIS WAY OF EXPRESSING HOW HAPPY HE FELT HE WAS A LITTLE BIGGER THAN HIS COUSIN CHEBEC BUT LOOKED VERY MUCH LIKE HIM THERE WAS A LITTLE NOTCH IN THE END OF HIS TAIL
1743-142913-0006 THE UPPER HALF OF HIS BILL WAS BLACK BUT THE LOWER HALF WAS LIGHT PETER COULD SEE ON EACH WING TWO WHITISH BARS AND HE NOTICED THAT PEWEE'S WINGS WERE LONGER THAN HIS TAIL WHICH WASN'T THE CASE WITH CHEBEC
1743-142913-0007 BUT NO ONE COULD EVER MISTAKE PEWEE FOR ANY OF HIS RELATIVES FOR THE SIMPLE REASON THAT HE KEEPS REPEATING HIS OWN NAME OVER AND OVER AREN'T YOU HERE EARLY ASKED PETER PEWEE NODDED
1743-142913-0008 THAT IS SOMETHING I DON'T OFTEN DO IF YOU PLEASE PETER INQUIRED POLITELY WHY DO FOLKS CALL YOU WOOD PEWEE PEWEE CHUCKLED HAPPILY
1743-142913-0009 IT IS SO QUIET AND RESTFUL THAT I LOVE IT MISSUS PEWEE AND I ARE VERY RETIRING WE DO NOT LIKE TOO MANY NEAR NEIGHBORS YOU WON'T MIND IF I COME TO SEE YOU ONCE IN A WHILE WILL YOU ASKED PETER AS HE PREPARED TO START ON AGAIN FOR THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH
1743-142913-0010 COME AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE REPLIED PEWEE THE OFTENER THE BETTER BACK IN THE OLD BRIAR PATCH PETER THOUGHT OVER ALL HE HAD LEARNED ABOUT THE FLYCATCHER FAMILY AND AS HE RECALLED HOW THEY WERE FOREVER CATCHING ALL SORTS OF FLYING INSECTS IT SUDDENLY STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0011 THAT THEY MUST BE VERY USEFUL LITTLE PEOPLE IN HELPING OLD MOTHER NATURE TAKE CARE OF HER TREES AND OTHER GROWING THINGS WHICH INSECTS SO DEARLY LOVE TO DESTROY
1743-142913-0012 BUT MOST OF ALL PETER THOUGHT ABOUT THAT QUEER REQUEST OF CRESTY'S AND A DOZEN TIMES THAT DAY HE FOUND HIMSELF PEEPING UNDER OLD LOGS IN THE HOPE OF FINDING A CAST OFF COAT OF MISTER BLACK SNAKE
1743-142913-0013 IT WAS SUCH A FUNNY THING FOR CRESTY TO ASK FOR THAT PETER'S CURIOSITY WOULD ALLOW HIM NO PEACE AND THE NEXT MORNING HE WAS UP IN THE OLD ORCHARD BEFORE JOLLY MISTER SUN HAD KICKED HIS BEDCLOTHES OFF
1743-142913-0014 JENNY WREN WAS AS GOOD AS HER WORD WHILE SHE FLITTED AND HOPPED ABOUT THIS WAY AND THAT WAY IN THAT FUSSY WAY OF HERS GETTING HER BREAKFAST SHE TALKED JENNY COULDN'T KEEP HER TONGUE STILL IF SHE WANTED TO DID YOU FIND ANY OLD CLOTHES OF THE SNAKE FAMILY SHE DEMANDED
1743-142913-0015 THEN AS PETER SHOOK HIS HEAD HER TONGUE RAN ON WITHOUT WAITING FOR HIM TO REPLY CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ALWAYS INSIST UPON HAVING A PIECE OF SNAKE SKIN IN THEIR NEST SAID SHE WHY THEY WANT IT GOODNESS KNOWS BUT
1743-142913-0016 PERHAPS THEY THINK IT WILL SCARE ROBBERS AWAY AS FOR ME I SHOULD HAVE A COLD CHILL EVERY TIME I GOT INTO MY NEST IF I HAD TO SIT ON ANYTHING LIKE THAT I HAVE TO ADMIT THAT CRESTY AND HIS WIFE ARE A HANDSOME COUPLE
1743-142913-0017 AND THEY CERTAINLY HAVE GOOD SENSE IN CHOOSING A HOUSE MORE SENSE THAN ANY OTHER MEMBER OF THEIR FAMILY TO MY WAY OF THINKING BUT SNAKE SKINS UGH BY THE WAY WHERE DOES CRESTY BUILD ASKED PETER
1743-142913-0018 IN A HOLE IN A TREE LIKE THE REST OF US SENSIBLE PEOPLE RETORTED JENNY WREN PROMPTLY PETER LOOKED QUITE AS SURPRISED AS HE FELT DOES CRESTY MAKE THE HOLE HE ASKED GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY WREN
1743-142913-0019 WHERE ARE YOUR EYES PETER DID YOU EVER SEE A FLYCATCHER WITH A BILL THAT LOOKED AS IF IT COULD CUT WOOD SHE DIDN'T WAIT FOR A REPLY BUT RATTLED ON IT IS A GOOD THING FOR A LOT OF US THAT THE WOODPECKER FAMILY ARE SO FOND OF NEW HOUSES LOOK
1743-142913-0020 THERE IS DOWNY THE WOODPECKER HARD AT WORK ON A NEW HOUSE THIS VERY MINUTE THAT'S GOOD I LIKE TO SEE THAT IT MEANS THAT NEXT YEAR THERE WILL BE ONE MORE HOUSE FOR SOME ONE HERE IN THE OLD ORCHARD FOR MYSELF I PREFER OLD HOUSES
1743-142913-0021 I'VE NOTICED THERE ARE A NUMBER OF MY NEIGHBORS WHO FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT IT THERE IS SOMETHING SETTLED ABOUT AN OLD HOUSE IT DOESN'T ATTRACT ATTENTION THE WAY A NEW ONE DOES SO LONG AS IT HAS GOT REASONABLY GOOD WALLS AND THE RAIN AND THE WIND CAN'T GET IN
1743-142913-0022 THE OLDER IT IS THE BETTER IT SUITS ME BUT THE WOODPECKERS SEEM TO LIKE NEW HOUSES BEST WHICH AS I SAID BEFORE IS A VERY GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US
1743-142913-0023 WINSOME BLUEBIRD STUPID SNAPPED JENNY WREN PETER GRINNED AND LOOKED FOOLISH OF COURSE SAID HE I FORGOT ALL ABOUT WINSOME AND SKIMMER THE TREE SWALLOW ADDED JENNY THAT'S SO I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBERED HIM EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142913-0024 I'VE NOTICED THAT HE IS VERY FOND OF THE SAME HOUSE YEAR AFTER YEAR IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE AGAIN JENNY WREN NODDED YANK YANK THE NUTHATCH USES AN OLD HOUSE I'M TOLD BUT HE USUALLY GOES UP NORTH FOR HIS NESTING SAID SHE
1743-142913-0025 TOMMY TIT THE CHICKADEE SOMETIMES USES AN OLD HOUSE THEN AGAIN HE AND MISSUS CHICKADEE GET FUSSY AND MAKE A HOUSE FOR THEMSELVES YELLOW WING THE FLICKER WHO REALLY IS A WOODPECKER OFTEN USES AN OLD HOUSE BUT QUITE OFTEN MAKES A NEW ONE
1743-142913-0026 THEN THERE ARE KILLY THE SPARROW HAWK AND SPOOKY THE SCREECH OWL PETER LOOKED SURPRISED I DIDN'T SUPPOSE THEY NESTED IN HOLES IN TREES HE EXCLAIMED THEY CERTAINLY DO MORE'S THE PITY SNAPPED JENNY
1743-142913-0027 IT WOULD BE A GOOD THING FOR THE REST OF US IF THEY DIDN'T NEST AT ALL BUT THEY DO AND AN OLD HOUSE OF YELLOW WING THE FLICKER SUITS EITHER OF THEM KILLY ALWAYS USES ONE THAT IS HIGH UP AND COMES BACK TO IT YEAR AFTER YEAR
1743-142913-0028 SPOOKY ISN'T PARTICULAR SO LONG AS THE HOUSE IS BIG ENOUGH TO BE COMFORTABLE HE LIVES IN IT MORE OR LESS THE YEAR AROUND NOW I MUST GET BACK TO THOSE EGGS OF MINE I'VE TALKED QUITE ENOUGH FOR ONE MORNING OH JENNY CRIED PETER AS A SUDDEN THOUGHT STRUCK HIM
1743-142913-0029 JENNY PAUSED AND JERKED HER TAIL IMPATIENTLY WELL WHAT IS IT NOW SHE DEMANDED HAVE YOU GOT TWO HOMES ASKED PETER GOODNESS GRACIOUS NO EXCLAIMED JENNY
1743-142913-0030 ONE IS ALL I CAN TAKE CARE OF THEN WHY DEMANDED PETER TRIUMPHANTLY DOES MISTER WREN WORK ALL DAY CARRYING STICKS AND STRAWS INTO A HOLE IN ANOTHER TREE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT HE HAS CARRIED ENOUGH IN THERE TO BUILD TWO OR THREE NESTS
1743-142914-0000 HE WASN'T READY TO GO BACK HOME TO THE DEAR OLD BRIAR PATCH YET THERE SEEMED NOTHING ELSE TO DO FOR EVERYBODY IN THE OLD ORCHARD WAS TOO BUSY FOR IDLE GOSSIP PETER SCRATCHED A LONG EAR WITH A LONG HIND FOOT TRYING TO THINK OF SOME PLACE TO GO
1743-142914-0001 I'LL JUST RUN OVER AND PAY MY RESPECTS TO GRANDFATHER FROG AND TO REDWING THE BLACKBIRD REDWING WAS ONE OF THE FIRST BIRDS TO ARRIVE AND I'VE NEGLECTED HIM SHAMEFULLY WHEN PETER THINKS OF SOMETHING TO DO HE WASTES NO TIME
1743-142914-0002 OFF HE STARTED LIPPERTY LIPPERTY LIP FOR THE SMILING POOL HE KEPT CLOSE TO THE EDGE OF THE GREEN FOREST UNTIL HE REACHED THE PLACE WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK COMES OUT OF THE GREEN FOREST ON ITS WAY TO THE SMILING POOL IN THE GREEN MEADOWS
1743-142914-0003 BUSHES AND YOUNG TREES GROW ALONG THE BANKS OF THE LAUGHING BROOK AT THIS POINT THE GROUND WAS SOFT IN PLACES QUITE MUDDY PETER DOESN'T MIND GETTING HIS FEET DAMP SO HE HOPPED ALONG CARELESSLY
1743-142914-0004 FROM RIGHT UNDER HIS VERY NOSE SOMETHING SHOT UP INTO THE AIR WITH A WHISTLING SOUND IT STARTLED PETER SO THAT HE STOPPED SHORT WITH HIS EYES POPPING OUT OF HIS HEAD
1743-142914-0005 HE HAD JUST A GLIMPSE OF A BROWN FORM DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF SOME TALL BUSHES THEN PETER CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0006 HE SCARED ME FOR A SECOND THEN YOU ARE EVEN SAID A VOICE CLOSE AT HAND YOU SCARED HIM I SAW YOU COMING BUT LONGBILL DIDN'T PETER TURNED QUICKLY THERE WAS MISSUS WOODCOCK PEEPING AT HIM FROM BEHIND A TUSSOCK OF GRASS
1743-142914-0007 I DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE HIM APOLOGIZED PETER I REALLY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO YOU THINK HE WAS REALLY VERY MUCH SCARED
1743-142914-0008 I RECOGNIZED YOU JUST AS I WAS DISAPPEARING OVER THE TOPS OF THE BUSHES SO I CAME RIGHT BACK I LEARNED WHEN I WAS VERY YOUNG THAT WHEN STARTLED IT IS BEST TO FLY FIRST AND FIND OUT AFTERWARDS WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS REAL DANGER
1743-142914-0009 I AM GLAD IT IS NO ONE BUT YOU PETER FOR I WAS HAVING A SPLENDID MEAL HERE AND I SHOULD HAVE HATED TO LEAVE IT YOU'LL EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO ON EATING I HOPE WE CAN TALK BETWEEN BITES
1743-142914-0010 CERTAINLY I'LL EXCUSE YOU REPLIED PETER STARING AROUND VERY HARD TO SEE WHAT IT COULD BE LONGBILL WAS MAKING SUCH A GOOD MEAL OF BUT PETER COULDN'T SEE A THING THAT LOOKED GOOD TO EAT THERE WASN'T EVEN A BUG OR A WORM CRAWLING ON THE GROUND
1743-142914-0011 LONGBILL TOOK TWO OR THREE STEPS IN RATHER A STATELY FASHION PETER HAD TO HIDE A SMILE FOR LONGBILL HAD SUCH AN AIR OF IMPORTANCE YET AT THE SAME TIME WAS SUCH AN ODD LOOKING FELLOW
1743-142914-0012 HE WAS QUITE A LITTLE BIGGER THAN WELCOME ROBIN HIS TAIL WAS SHORT HIS LEGS WERE SHORT AND HIS NECK WAS SHORT BUT HIS BILL WAS LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE UP
1743-142914-0013 HIS BACK WAS A MIXTURE OF GRAY BROWN BLACK AND BUFF WHILE HIS BREAST AND UNDER PARTS WERE A BEAUTIFUL REDDISH BUFF IT WAS HIS HEAD THAT MADE HIM LOOK QUEER
1743-142914-0014 HIS EYES WERE VERY BIG AND THEY WERE SET SO FAR BACK THAT PETER WONDERED IF IT WASN'T EASIER FOR HIM TO LOOK BEHIND HIM THAN IN FRONT OF HIM SUDDENLY LONGBILL PLUNGED HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND HE PLUNGED IT IN FOR THE WHOLE LENGTH
1743-142914-0015 THEN HE PULLED IT OUT AND PETER CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF THE TAIL END OF A WORM DISAPPEARING DOWN LONGBILL'S THROAT WHERE THAT LONG BILL HAD GONE INTO THE GROUND WAS A NEAT LITTLE ROUND HOLE
1743-142914-0016 FOR THE FIRST TIME PETER NOTICED THAT THERE WERE MANY SUCH LITTLE ROUND HOLES ALL ABOUT DID YOU MAKE ALL THOSE LITTLE ROUND HOLES EXCLAIMED PETER
1743-142914-0017 AND WAS THERE A WORM IN EVERY ONE ASKED PETER HIS EYES VERY WIDE WITH INTEREST LONGBILL NODDED
1743-142914-0018 PETER REMEMBERED HOW HE HAD WATCHED WELCOME ROBIN LISTEN AND THEN SUDDENLY PLUNGE HIS BILL INTO THE GROUND AND PULL OUT A WORM BUT THE WORMS WELCOME ROBIN GOT WERE ALWAYS CLOSE TO THE SURFACE
1743-142914-0019 WHILE THESE WORMS WERE SO DEEP IN THE EARTH THAT PETER COULDN'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR ANY ONE TO KNOW THAT THEY WERE THERE
1743-142914-0020 AND HOW IS IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO OPEN YOUR BILL DOWN THERE TO TAKE HIM IN ASKED PETER LONGBILL CHUCKLED
1743-142914-0021 LONGBILL SUDDENLY THRUST HIS BILL STRAIGHT OUT IN FRONT OF HIM AND TO PETER'S ASTONISHMENT HE LIFTED THE END OF THE UPPER HALF WITHOUT OPENING THE REST OF HIS BILL AT ALL THAT'S THE WAY I GET THEM SAID HE
1743-142914-0022 I THINK THERE IS ONE RIGHT UNDER MY FEET NOW WATCH ME GET HIM LONGBILL BORED INTO THE GROUND UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS ALMOST AGAINST IT WHEN HE PULLED HIS BILL OUT SURE ENOUGH THERE WAS A WORM OF COURSE EXPLAINED LONGBILL IT IS ONLY IN SOFT GROUND THAT I CAN DO THIS
1743-142914-0023 THAT IS WHY I HAVE TO FLY AWAY SOUTH AS SOON AS THE GROUND FREEZES AT ALL IT'S WONDERFUL SIGHED PETER I DON'T SUPPOSE ANY ONE ELSE CAN FIND HIDDEN WORMS THAT WAY MY COUSIN JACK SNIPE CAN REPLIED LONGBILL PROMPTLY
1743-142914-0024 HE FEEDS THE SAME WAY I DO ONLY HE LIKES MARSHY MEADOWS INSTEAD OF BRUSHY SWAMPS PERHAPS YOU KNOW HIM PETER NODDED I DO SAID HE NOW YOU SPEAK OF IT THERE IS A STRONG FAMILY RESEMBLANCE ALTHOUGH I HADN'T THOUGHT OF HIM AS A RELATIVE OF YOURS BEFORE
1743-142914-0025 NOW I MUST BE RUNNING ALONG I'M EVER SO GLAD TO HAVE SEEN YOU AND I'M COMING OVER TO CALL AGAIN THE FIRST CHANCE I GET SO PETER SAID GOOD BY AND KEPT ON DOWN THE LAUGHING BROOK TO THE SMILING POOL RIGHT WHERE THE LAUGHING BROOK ENTERED THE SMILING POOL
1743-142914-0026 THERE WAS A LITTLE PEBBLY BEACH RUNNING ALONG THE VERY EDGE OF THE WATER WAS A SLIM TRIM LITTLE BIRD WITH FAIRLY LONG LEGS A LONG SLENDER BILL BROWNISH GRAY BACK WITH BLACK SPOTS AND MARKINGS AND A WHITE WAISTCOAT NEATLY SPOTTED WITH BLACK
1743-142914-0027 EVERY FEW STEPS HE WOULD STOP TO PICK UP SOMETHING THEN STAND FOR A SECOND BOBBING UP AND DOWN IN THE FUNNIEST WAY AS IF HIS BODY WAS SO NICELY BALANCED ON HIS LEGS THAT IT TEETERED BACK AND FORTH LIKE A SEESAW
1743-142914-0028 IT WAS TEETER THE SPOTTED SANDPIPER AN OLD FRIEND OF PETER'S PETER GREETED HIM JOYOUSLY
1743-142914-0029 BEFORE PETER COULD SAY ANOTHER WORD TEETER CAME RUNNING TOWARDS HIM AND IT WAS PLAIN TO SEE THAT TEETER WAS VERY ANXIOUS ABOUT SOMETHING DON'T MOVE PETER RABBIT DON'T MOVE HE CRIED WHY NOT DEMANDED PETER FOR HE COULD SEE NO DANGER AND COULD THINK OF NO REASON WHY HE SHOULDN'T MOVE
1743-142914-0030 JUST THEN MISSUS TEETER CAME HURRYING UP AND SQUATTED DOWN IN THE SAND RIGHT IN FRONT OF PETER THANK GOODNESS EXCLAIMED TEETER STILL BOBBING AND BOWING IF YOU HAD TAKEN ANOTHER STEP PETER RABBIT YOU WOULD HAVE STEPPED RIGHT ON OUR EGGS YOU GAVE ME A DREADFUL START
1743-142914-0031 MISSUS TEETER STOOD UP AND STEPPED ASIDE THEN PETER SAW RIGHT IN A LITTLE HOLLOW IN THE SAND WITH JUST A FEW BITS OF GRASS FOR A LINING FOUR WHITE EGGS WITH BIG DARK BLOTCHES ON THEM
1743-142914-0032 THEY LOOKED SO MUCH LIKE THE SURROUNDING PEBBLES THAT HE NEVER WOULD HAVE SEEN THEM IN THE WORLD BUT FOR MISSUS TEETER PETER HASTILY BACKED AWAY A FEW STEPS MISSUS TEETER SLIPPED BACK ON THE EGGS AND SETTLED HERSELF COMFORTABLY
1743-142914-0033 IT SUDDENLY STRUCK PETER THAT IF HE HADN'T SEEN HER DO IT HE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN SHE WAS THERE
1743-142914-0034 MY HE EXCLAIMED I CERTAINLY WOULD HAVE STEPPED ON THOSE EGGS IF YOU HADN'T WARNED ME SAID HE I'M SO THANKFUL I DIDN'T I DON'T SEE HOW YOU DARE LAY THEM IN THE OPEN LIKE THIS
1841-150351-0000 THE NATIVE INHABITANTS OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE THE EXPLORERS AND EARLY SETTLERS FOUND A NATIVE RACE OCCUPYING NEARLY EVERY PORTION OF OUR CONTINENT THESE PEOPLE HAD MANY CHARACTERISTICS IN COMMON AND WERE ALL CALLED INDIANS
1841-150351-0001 IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE COUNTRY WHERE THE SURFACE IS BROKEN BY NUMEROUS BARRIERS SUCH AS MOUNTAINS AND DESERTS ALMOST EVERY VALLEY WAS FOUND TO BE OCCUPIED BY A DISTINCT GROUP OF INDIANS CALLED A TRIBE
1841-150351-0002 THE LANGUAGE OF EACH TRIBE DIFFERED SO MUCH FROM THE LANGUAGES OF ADJOINING TRIBES THAT THEY COULD WITH DIFFICULTY UNDERSTAND ONE ANOTHER THESE TRIBES WERE ALMOST CONTINUALLY AT WAR
1841-150351-0003 THE INDIANS UPON THE PACIFIC SLOPE WERE GENERALLY FOUND TO BE INFERIOR IN MOST RESPECTS TO THOSE LIVING IN THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CONTINENT ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE THAT THE TRIBES POSSESSING THE FAIR AND FERTILE VALLEYS OF CALIFORNIA
1841-150351-0004 WOULD BE THE MOST ADVANCED IN CIVILIZATION BUT SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE MANY OF THEM WERE AMONG THE MOST DEGRADED UPON THE CONTINENT THEY SEEMED UNABLE TO ADAPT THEMSELVES TO THE WHITE MAN AND HIS WAYS
1841-150351-0005 AND IN THE OLDER SETTLED DISTRICTS THEY HAVE NOW NEARLY DISAPPEARED IN THE NEWER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHWEST AND ALONG THE COAST TOWARD ALASKA THE INDIANS HAVE NOT YET COME INTO SO DIRECT CONTACT WITH THE WHITE MEN
1841-150351-0006 THEY DID NOT CULTIVATE THE SOIL NOR DID THEY HUNT A GREAT DEAL ALTHOUGH THE COUNTRY ABOUNDED WITH GAME
1841-150351-0007 THESE INDIANS HAVE OFTEN BEEN CALLED DIGGERS BECAUSE THEY DEPENDED SO LARGELY FOR THEIR LIVING UPON THE ROOTS WHICH THEY DUG IT WOULD SEEM NATURAL THAT ABOUT SAN FRANCISCO BAY THE NATIVES SHOULD HAVE USED CANOES
1841-150351-0008 BUT ACCORDING TO EARLY TRAVELLERS THEY HAD NONE WHEN THEY WISHED TO GO OUT UPON THE WATER THEY BUILT RAFTS OF BUNDLES OF RUSHES OR TULES TIED TOGETHER AT FAVORABLE POINTS ALONG THE SHORE THE INDIANS COLLECTED FOR THEIR FEASTS
1841-150351-0009 AND THESE SPOTS ARE NOW INDICATED BY HEAPS OF SHELLS IN SOME PLACES FORMING MOUNDS OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE
1841-150351-0010 IN THE MOUNTAINS THE SITES OF THE VILLAGES ARE MARKED BY CHIPS OF OBSIDIAN A VOLCANIC GLASS USED IN MAKING ARROW TIPS AND BY HOLES IN THE FLAT SURFACES OF GRANITIC ROCKS NEAR SOME SPRING OR STREAM
1841-150351-0011 THESE HOLES WERE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF GRINDING ACORNS OR NUTS MANY OF THE INDIAN TRIBES DEVELOPED GREAT SKILL IN THE WEAVING OF BASKETS WHICH THEY USED FOR MANY DIFFERENT PURPOSES
1841-150351-0012 THE BASKETS ARE STILL MADE IN SOME PLACES AND ARE MUCH SOUGHT AFTER BECAUSE OF THEIR BEAUTY THE INDIANS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IN BUILDING THEIR HOMES DUG ROUND SHALLOW HOLES OVER WHICH POLES WERE BENT IN THE FORM OF A HALF CIRCLE
1841-150351-0013 AND AFTER HE HAD ENTERED AND ALL OPENINGS WERE CLOSED HE POURED WATER UPON THE STONES UNTIL THE ROOM WAS FILLED WITH STEAM AFTER ENDURING THIS PROCESS AS LONG AS HE DESIRED THE INDIAN CAME OUT AND PLUNGED INTO THE COLD WATER OF A NEAR BY STREAM
1841-150351-0014 AS MAY BE IMAGINED SUCH A BATH OFTEN RESULTED DISASTROUSLY TO THE WEAK OR SICK THE FACT THAT THE CALIFORNIA INDIANS COULD SUPPORT THEMSELVES WITHOUT ANY GREAT EXERTION
1841-150351-0015 AT CERTAIN SEASONS OF THE YEAR WHEN SALMON WERE PLENTIFUL EACH TRIBE OR GROUP OF INDIANS ESTABLISHED ITS CAMP NEAR ONE OF THE MANY RAPIDS AND WATERFALLS ALONG THE COLUMBIA RIVER LARGE NUMBERS OF THE SALMON WERE CAUGHT BY THE USE OF TRAPS
1841-150351-0016 AFTER BEING PARTLY DRIED THEY WERE PACKED IN BALES FOR WINTER USE THE FISH THUS PREPARED WERE CONSIDERED VERY VALUABLE AND FORMED AN ARTICLE OF TRADE WITH THE TRIBES LIVING FARTHER FROM THE RIVER
1841-150351-0017 BUT THIS ENTHUSIASM QUICKLY DISAPPEARS IF A HEAD WIND COMES UP AND THE PARTY GOES ASHORE TO WAIT FOR THE BREEZE TO TURN IN A MORE FAVORABLE DIRECTION THESE INDIANS AS MIGHT BE SUPPOSED LIVE LARGELY UPON FISH
1841-150351-0018 BERRIES ARE ABUNDANT DURING THE SUMMER AND ARE ALSO MUCH USED FOR FOOD THE CLOTHING OF THE INDIANS WAS ORIGINALLY A SORT OF BLANKET MADE OF THE WOVEN FIBRES OF CEDAR BARK OR MORE RARELY OF THE SKINS OF ANIMALS
1841-150351-0019 AND LEAVING IT THERE WHILE THE HEAD IS GROWING
1841-150351-0020 THE BUILDINGS ARE STRUNG ALONG THE SHORE CLOSE UNDER THE EDGE OF THE THICK FOREST AND JUST ABOVE THE REACH OF THE WAVES AT HIGH TIDE THEY ARE VERY SOLIDLY CONSTRUCTED
1841-150351-0021 FOR THESE INDIANS DO NOT MOVE ABOUT AS MUCH AS THOSE FARTHER SOUTH WHERE THE FORESTS ARE LESS DENSE FIGURE SIXTY FIVE SHOWS THE FRAMEWORK OF A PARTIALLY BUILT HOUSE WHILE ANOTHER STANDS AT ONE SIDE COMPLETED
1841-150351-0022 LARGE POSTS ARE SET IN THE GROUND AT THE CORNERS AND ENDS OF THE BUILDING CROSS LOGS ARE THEN PLACED UPON THE MIDDLE POSTS
1841-150351-0023 THIS IS SOMETIMES TWO FEET IN DIAMETER AND FROM SIXTY TO EIGHTY FEET LONG IT MUST REQUIRE THE UNITED STRENGTH OF MANY MEN TO ROLL SUCH A LOG INTO POSITION UPON THE FRAMEWORK THUS CONSTRUCTED SPLIT CEDAR BOARDS ARE FASTENED
1841-150351-0024 AND THE BUILDING IS PRACTICALLY FINISHED SUCH A HOUSE IS USUALLY OCCUPIED BY A NUMBER OF FAMILIES UPON QUEEN CHARLOTTE ISLANDS THERE IS A DWELLING OF THIS KIND LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD SEVEN HUNDRED INDIANS
1841-150351-0025 THE FRONTS OF THE HOUSES ARE ORNAMENTED WITH FIGURES HEWN OUT OF WOOD THESE REPRESENT MEN BIRDS AND ANIMALS AND HAVE A RELIGIOUS SIGNIFICANCE SOMETIMES THESE FIGURES ARE MOUNTED UPON THE TOPS OF TALL POLES
1841-150351-0026 THE TOTEM POLE IS A MOST INTERESTING AFFAIR FIGURE SIXTY SIX REPRESENTS THE POLE AT ALERT BAY EAST OF VANCOUVER ISLAND IT IS ONE OF THE FINEST UPON THE NORTH COAST
1841-150351-0027 THE FIGURES OF ANIMALS AND BIRDS CARVED UPON IT REPRESENT THE MYTHOLOGICAL ANCESTORS OF THE FAMILY OR CLAN IN FRONT OF WHOSE ABODE THE POLE STANDS THE INDIANS OFTEN HUNT SIMILAR ANIMALS TO DAY
1841-150351-0028 BUT BELIEVE THAT THEIR ANCESTORS HAD SUPERNATURAL POWER WHICH RAISED THEM ABOVE THE ORDINARY CREATURES THE CHINOOK INDIANS LIVE UPON THE LOWER COLUMBIA
1841-150351-0029 THE NAME CHINOOK HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A WARM DRY WIND WHICH BLOWS DOWN THE EASTERN SLOPE OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND OUT UPON THE GREAT PLAINS THIS WIND IS SO NAMED BECAUSE IT BLOWS FROM THE DIRECTION OF THE CHINOOK INDIANS COUNTRY
1841-150351-0030 THE CHINOOK JARGON IS A STRANGE SORT OF MIXED LANGUAGE WITH WHICH NEARLY ALL THE TRIBES OF THE NORTHWEST ARE FAMILIAR IT IS FORMED OF WORDS FROM THE CHINOOK LANGUAGE TOGETHER WITH OTHERS FROM DIFFERENT INDIAN LANGUAGES
1841-150351-0031 IT SEEMS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THESE AMERICAN INDIANS ORIGINALLY CAME ACROSS THE NARROW STRIP OF WATER SEPARATING ASIA FROM AMERICA WE DO NOT KNOW HOW LONG THE INDIANS HAVE OCCUPIED OUR COUNTRY
1841-150351-0032 BUT IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN SEVERAL THOUSAND YEARS SOME OF THE MAIN GROUPS HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY BEEN HERE LONGER THAN OTHERS
1841-159771-0000 THERE'S NO SENSE IN WASTING OUR TIME HERE SAID SOLOMON OWL TO HIS SMALL COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER IT'S A FINE NIGHT THE MICE WILL ALL BE OUT SOONER OR LATER LET'S GO OVER AND SIT IN THAT OLD OAK ON THE EDGE OF THE MEADOW
1841-159771-0001 SIMON SCREECHER WAS MORE THAN WILLING AND THEY HAD NO SOONER SETTLED THEMSELVES AMONG THE BARE BRANCHES OF THE OAK WHEN SIMON STARTED TO AMUSE HIMSELF BY GIVING HIS WELL KNOWN QUAVERING WHISTLE SOLOMON OWL STOPPED HIM QUICKLY
1841-159771-0002 DON'T DO THAT HE SAID SHARPLY DO YOU WANT TO SCARE THE MICE SIMON SCREECHER CUT HIS WHISTLE OFF RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF IT I FORGOT HE MURMURED BUT I DON'T BELIEVE MY WHISTLING WOULD DO ANY HARM
1841-159771-0003 I DON'T THINK THERE ARE MANY MICE LEFT ON FARMER GREEN'S PLACE IT'S MY OPINION THAT THEY'VE MOVED AWAY MOST OF THEM OR MAYBE OLD ROUGH LEG THE HAWK HAS CAUGHT MORE THAN HIS SHARE
1841-159771-0004 SOLOMON OWL MADE NO REPLY HE WAS A PERSON OF FEW WORDS IF ANYBODY ASKED HIS OPINION HE WAS READY TO GIVE IT BUT HE SELDOM GAVE ANY UNSOUGHT ADVICE
1841-159771-0005 I'VE ABOUT MADE UP MY MIND SAID SIMON SCREECHER THAT I'D MOVE TO SOME OTHER NEIGHBORHOOD IF I KNEW WHERE THERE WAS GOOD MOUSING I'D MOVE TO MORROW WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING SOLOMON OWL STARTED EVER SO SLIGHTLY
1841-159771-0006 YOU MIGHT AS WELL SEND THEM A TELEGRAM SAYING THAT YOU'LL BE ON HAND TO MEET THEM AT EIGHT P M SIMON SCREECHER WAS SILENCED FOR THE TIME BEING AND IT WASN'T LONG BEFORE SOLOMON OWL GAVE ANOTHER START THERE'S THAT SQUEAK AGAIN HE WHISPERED
1841-159771-0007 I BELIEVE IT IS GETTING NEARER TOO NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HAD A TUNNEL THAT LED RIGHT BENEATH THE TREE WHERE THE TWO COUSINS WERE SITTING
1841-159771-0008 AND HE HAD STROLLED THAT WAY AFTER SCURRYING UNDER THE SNOW WHEN HE HEARD SOLOMON OWL LAUGHING IN THE WOODS EARLIER IN THE EVENING IT WAS HE THAT SOLOMON HEARD IT WAS HE THAT STUCK HIS HEAD OUT OF A HOLE IN THE SNOW AND PEEPED UP AT THE STAR SPRINKLED SKY
1841-159771-0009 HE MUST HAVE HURRIED OVER HERE FROM THE WOODS HE MUST BE VERY HUNGRY AS SOLOMON OWL RETURNED TO THE OLD OAK HIS COUSIN SIMON SCREECHER LAUGHED SOMEWHAT UNPLEASANTLY MISSED HIM DIDN'T YOU HE INQUIRED YES
1841-159771-0010 WHY DIDN'T YOU GRAB HIM OUT OF THE SNOW SIMON ASKED WHAT ARE YOUR CLAWS FOR WHAT'S YOUR BEAK FOR I COULDN'T DIG HIM OUT SOLOMON OWL REPLIED THE SNOW IS THREE FEET DEEP
1841-159771-0011 AND IT HAS SEVEN DIFFERENT CRUSTS ONE UNDER ANOTHER THIS IS A HARD WINTER SAID SIMON SCREECHER I WISH I'D GONE SOUTH LAST FALL I WONDER HOW THE MOUSING IS DOWN THERE
1841-159771-0012 EATING A TREE AS SIMON SCREECHER REMARKED TO HIS COUSIN SOLOMON OWL IT WAS A HARD WINTER THE SNOW WAS DEEP THE DAYS WERE COLD AND THE NIGHTS WERE COLDER AND WORST OF ALL FOOD BECAME SCARCE
1841-159771-0013 IT SEEMED AS IF THERE WASN'T ANYTHING TO EAT ANYWHERE EXCEPT AT THE FARM BUILDINGS WHICH FARMER GREEN HAD STUFFED FULL OF HAY AND GRAIN DURING THE SUMMER AND AUTUMN MANY OF THE FOREST FOLK STOLE DOWN FROM BLUE MOUNTAIN AFTER NIGHTFALL
1841-159771-0014 AND VISITED THE FARMYARD IN THE HOPE OF GETTING A BITE OF SOMETHING OR OTHER EVEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BEGAN TO FIND IT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET ENOUGH SEEDS UNDER THE SNOW TO SATISFY HIS HUNGER
1841-159771-0015 HE HAD STORED AWAY A STOCK OF FOOD BUT IT HADN'T BEEN BIG ENOUGH AND THAT WAS A GREAT MISTAKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE PROMISED HIMSELF THAT HE WOULD NOT REPEAT IT ANOTHER TIME
1841-159771-0016 UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE PROMISES IN THE WORLD WOULDN'T GIVE HIM A SQUARE MEAL WHEN HE NEEDED ONE
1841-159771-0017 THIS IS MY FIRST WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE EXPLAINED I'M RUNNING SHORT OF FOOD AND I WISH YOU'D TELL ME WHAT TO DO IN SUCH A CASE THAT'S EASY HIS COUSIN ANSWERED GET MORE
1841-159771-0018 AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY FOR HE HAD IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO POOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE RAN AFTER HIM IT WAS HARD TO FOLLOW HIS COUSIN THROUGH THE WINDING GALLERIES BENEATH THE SNOW
1841-159771-0019 SEVERAL TIMES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TOOK THE WRONG TURN AND HAD TO RETRACE HIS STEPS BUT AT LAST HE FOUND HIS BUSY COUSIN AGAIN YOU ADVISED ME TO GET MORE FOOD SAID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE BUT YOU DIDN'T TELL ME WHERE TO GET IT
1841-159771-0020 IN THE ORCHARD HIS COUSIN CRIED AND THEN HE HURRIED AWAY AGAIN I WISH HE'D WAIT A MINUTE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE GRUMBLED AS HE TORE AFTER HIS COUSIN ONCE MORE
1841-159771-0021 I DON'T FEEL LIKE RUNNING I HAVEN'T HAD A HEARTY MEAL FOR DAYS THE COUSIN SEEMED SURPRISED WHEN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE OVERTOOK HIM WHAT THAT BUSY GENTLEMAN EXCLAIMED HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE ORCHARD AND BACK SO SOON NO
1841-159771-0022 HAVING SAID THOSE THREE WORDS HE DASHED OFF AGAIN EVEN FASTER THAN BEFORE TREES MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ECHOED I CAN'T EAT TREES
1841-159771-0023 THERE MUST BE SOMETHING THAT MY COUSIN FORGOT TO EXPLAIN SO I SUPPOSE I'LL HAVE TO RUN AFTER HIM AGAIN AND ASK HIM WHAT HE MEANT THE FOURTH TIME THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE FOUND HIS COUSIN HE TOOK NO CHANCES
1841-159771-0024 HE CAUGHT HIS COUSIN BY HIS TAIL AND HELD ON FIRMLY YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET AWAY FROM ME TILL I'VE FOUND OUT WHAT I WANT TO KNOW HE DECLARED HOW CAN I EAT A TREE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE DEMANDED YOU CAN'T
1841-159771-0025 HIS COUSIN REPLIED STRUGGLING DESPERATELY TO FREE HIMSELF FOR HE WAS TOO BUSY TO STOP LONG THEN EXPLAIN WHAT YOU MEAN MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CRIED EAT THE BARK HIS COUSIN ANSWERED
1841-159771-0026 THEN AND NOT TILL THEN DID MASTER MEADOW MOUSE LET HIM GO MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CHASED HIS COUSIN NO MORE BUT HURRIED AWAY TO FARMER GREEN'S ORCHARD WHERE HE GNAWED A RING
1841-159771-0027 BUT FARMER GREEN DIDN'T AGREE WITH HIM WHEN HE HAPPENED TO GO INTO THE ORCHARD ONE DAY LATER AND SAW TREE AFTER TREE RUINED HE WAS VERY VERY MUCH DISPLEASED
1841-159771-0028 I OUGHT TO HAVE PUT WIRE NETTING AROUND THOSE YOUNG TREES HE TOLD THE HIRED MAN THIS IS WHAT COMES OF A HARD WINTER
1841-159771-0029 A COLD DIP IN ONE WAY PETER MINK WAS LIKE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE HE ENJOYED SWIMMING AND HE SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF HIS TIME ALONG THE STREAMS THAT THREADED THEIR WAY THROUGH PLEASANT VALLEY SOMETIMES PETER DAWDLED ON THE BANKS OF SWIFT RIVER
1841-159771-0030 SOMETIMES HE LINGERED FOR DAYS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF BLACK CREEK NOR DID HE DISDAIN SO SMALL A STREAM AS THE BROOK THAT CROSSED THE MEADOW IT WAS DEEP ENOUGH FOR A SWIM AND HE KNEW THAT MUSKRATS LIVED UNDER ITS BANKS
1841-159771-0031 WELL PETER MINK HAD SURPRISED MANY A ONE SWIMMING IN THE BROOK IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THE MEADOW MICE PERHAPS HE WOULDN'T HAVE VISITED THE BROOK SO OFTEN EVEN IN WINTER MASTER MEADOW MOUSE JUST HAD TO HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN
1841-159771-0032 JUST BECAUSE THERE WAS SKATING FOR JOHNNIE GREEN ON TOP OF THE BROOK IT MUSTN'T BE SUPPOSED THAT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WASN'T GOING TO HAVE A SWIM WHEN HE WANTED ONE
1841-159771-0033 WHEN PETER MINK WANDERED ALONG A STREAM IN WINTER HE PREFERRED TO TRAVEL UNDER THE ICE RATHER THAN WALK UPON THE UPPER SIDE OF IT
1841-159771-0034 IT MADE LITTLE DIFFERENCE TO HIM WHETHER THERE WAS A DRY STRIP ALONG THE EDGE OF THE STREAM WHERE HE COULD STEAL SILENTLY ALONG WITHOUT WETTING HIS FEET WHEN HE FOUND NO PLACE TO WALK HE SWAM NOW MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS WELL AWARE OF THIS TRICK OF PETER MINK'S
1841-159771-0035 THIS TRICK OF LURKING BENEATH THE ICE OF RIVER CREEK AND BROOK BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WOULD HAVE HIS COLD DIP NOW AND THEN DESPITE PETER MINK AND HIS PROWLING WAYS TO BE SURE MASTER MEADOW MOUSE TRIED TO BE CAREFUL
1841-159771-0036 BEFORE HE CREPT FROM THE END OF HIS TUNNEL HE STUCK HIS HEAD OUT AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN AND ALL AROUND HE PEEPED UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK HE EVEN STARED INTO THE WATER AND THEN IF HE SAW NOBODY THAT WAS FIERCER THAN PADDY MUSKRAT
1841-159771-0037 ONLY THEN WOULD HE VENTURE TO SKIP TO THE WATER'S EDGE AND PLUNGE IN TO TELL THE TRUTH MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS FELT SAFER WHEN ONE OF THE MUSKRAT FAMILY HAPPENED TO BE TAKING A SWIM AT THE SAME TIME
1841-159771-0038 FOR THE MUSKRATS ALL HAD A WARNING SIGNAL THAT TOLD EVERYBODY WHEN THERE WAS DANGER WHEN ONE OF THEM CAUGHT SIGHT OF PETER MINK HE NEVER FAILED IF HE WAS IN THE WATER TO GIVE A LOUD SLAP UPON THE SURFACE WITH HIS TAIL
1841-159771-0039 MASTER MEADOW MOUSE ALWAYS HAD ONE EAR THAT WAS LISTENING FOR THAT SLAP AND WHEN IT SOUNDED HE NEVER WAITED AN INSTANT BUT DARTED INTO HIS TUNNEL WITHOUT EVEN STOPPING TO SHAKE THE WATER OFF HIS COAT
1841-159771-0040 HE SAID THAT HE COULD DRY HIS COAT AFTER HE REACHED HOME WHILE IF HE STOPPED TO DRY IT AT THE EDGE OF THE BROOK PERHAPS HE'D NEVER GET HOME AT ALL YOU MIGHT THINK THAT NOW AND THEN HE WOULD HAVE SAID TO HIMSELF
1841-159771-0041 OH I WON'T BOTHER TO LOOK FOR PETER MINK TO DAY HE MUST BE MILES AWAY I'LL STEP RIGHT OUT OF MY TUNNEL AND HAVE MY SWIM WITHOUT TAKING A LOOK SEE FIRST BUT MASTER MEADOW MOUSE WAS NEVER SO LAZY AS THAT
1841-159771-0042 AND THE DAY CAME AT LAST WHEN IT WAS WELL WORTH HIS WHILE TO TAKE THE LITTLE EXTRA TROUBLE OF PEEPING OUT BEFORE HE HAD HIS SWIM FOR MASTER MEADOW MOUSE CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF A SNAKELIKE HEAD THAT DARTED OUT FROM UNDER THE BANK OF THE BROOK AND DARTED BACK AGAIN OUT OF SIGHT
1841-179183-0000 AND HIS TONGUE GAVE MY HAND A LICK HE PRESSED CLOSE TO ME AS IF HE WERE FAIN TO CROWD HIMSELF INTO MY HAND HE LOVED IT WITH HIS TAIL WITH HIS PAW WITH HIS TONGUE IF HE COULD SPEAK I BELIEVE HE WOULD SAY WITH ME
1841-179183-0001 THAT PARADISE IS ATTAINED BY TOUCH FOR IN TOUCH IS ALL LOVE AND INTELLIGENCE THIS SMALL INCIDENT STARTED ME ON A CHAT ABOUT HANDS AND IF MY CHAT IS FORTUNATE I HAVE TO THANK MY DOG STAR
1841-179183-0002 IN ANY CASE IT IS PLEASANT TO HAVE SOMETHING TO TALK ABOUT THAT NO ONE ELSE HAS MONOPOLIZED IT IS LIKE MAKING A NEW PATH IN THE TRACKLESS WOODS BLAZING THE TRAIL WHERE NO FOOT HAS PRESSED BEFORE
1841-179183-0003 I AM GLAD TO TAKE YOU BY THE HAND AND LEAD YOU ALONG AN UNTRODDEN WAY INTO A WORLD WHERE THE HAND IS SUPREME BUT AT THE VERY OUTSET WE ENCOUNTER A DIFFICULTY YOU ARE SO ACCUSTOMED TO LIGHT
1841-179183-0004 I PROMISE THAT YOU SHALL NOT BE LED INTO FIRE OR WATER OR FALL INTO A DEEP PIT IF YOU WILL FOLLOW ME PATIENTLY YOU WILL FIND THAT THERE'S A SOUND SO FINE NOTHING LIVES TWIXT IT AND SILENCE
1841-179183-0005 AND THAT THERE IS MORE MEANT IN THINGS THAN MEETS THE EYE MY HAND IS TO ME WHAT YOUR HEARING AND SIGHT TOGETHER ARE TO YOU IN LARGE MEASURE WE TRAVEL THE SAME HIGHWAYS READ THE SAME BOOKS SPEAK THE SAME LANGUAGE
1841-179183-0006 A SLIGHT FLUTTER OF THE FINGERS BEGAN THE INTELLIGENCE THE JOY THE FULLNESS OF MY LIFE LIKE JOB I FEEL AS IF A HAND HAD MADE ME FASHIONED ME TOGETHER ROUND ABOUT AND MOULDED MY VERY SOUL
1841-179183-0007 IN ALL MY EXPERIENCES AND THOUGHTS I AM CONSCIOUS OF A HAND WHATEVER MOVES ME WHATEVER THRILLS ME IS AS A HAND THAT TOUCHES ME IN THE DARK AND THAT TOUCH IS MY REALITY YOU MIGHT AS WELL SAY THAT A SIGHT WHICH MAKES YOU GLAD
1841-179183-0008 ALL THESE AND A THOUSAND RESULTANT COMBINATIONS WHICH TAKE SHAPE IN MY MIND CONSTITUTE MY WORLD IDEAS MAKE THE WORLD WE LIVE IN AND IMPRESSIONS FURNISH IDEAS MY WORLD IS BUILT OF TOUCH SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0009 BUT WITHOUT COLOUR AND SOUND IT BREATHES AND THROBS WITH LIFE
1841-179183-0010 OF BEAUTY OR OF INCONGRUITY FOR WITH MY HANDS I CAN FEEL THE COMIC AS WELL AS THE BEAUTIFUL IN THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE OF THINGS REMEMBER THAT YOU DEPENDENT ON YOUR SIGHT DO NOT REALIZE HOW MANY THINGS ARE TANGIBLE
1841-179183-0011 ALL PALPABLE THINGS ARE MOBILE OR RIGID SOLID OR LIQUID BIG OR SMALL WARM OR COLD AND THESE QUALITIES ARE VARIOUSLY MODIFIED
1841-179183-0012 THE COOLNESS OF A WATER LILY ROUNDING INTO BLOOM IS DIFFERENT FROM THE COOLNESS OF AN EVENING WIND IN SUMMER AND DIFFERENT AGAIN FROM THE COOLNESS OF THE RAIN THAT SOAKS INTO THE HEARTS OF GROWING THINGS AND GIVES THEM LIFE AND BODY
1841-179183-0013 THE VELVET OF THE ROSE IS NOT THAT OF A RIPE PEACH OR OF A BABY'S DIMPLED CHEEK THE HARDNESS OF THE ROCK IS TO THE HARDNESS OF WOOD WHAT A MAN'S DEEP BASS IS TO A WOMAN'S VOICE WHEN IT IS LOW
1841-179183-0014 WHAT I CALL BEAUTY I FIND IN CERTAIN COMBINATIONS OF ALL THESE QUALITIES AND IS LARGELY DERIVED FROM THE FLOW OF CURVED AND STRAIGHT LINES WHICH IS OVER ALL THINGS WHAT DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE MEAN TO YOU
1841-179183-0015 IT MEANS SEVERAL THINGS IT SYMBOLIZES DUTY IT SEEMS TO HAVE THE QUALITY OF INEXORABLENESS THAT DUTY HAS WHEN I HAVE SOMETHING TO DO THAT MUST NOT BE SET ASIDE I FEEL AS IF I WERE GOING FORWARD IN A STRAIGHT LINE
1841-179183-0016 OR GO ON FOREVER WITHOUT SWERVING TO THE RIGHT OR TO THE LEFT THAT IS WHAT IT MEANS TO ESCAPE THIS MORALIZING YOU SHOULD ASK HOW DOES THE STRAIGHT LINE FEEL IT FEELS AS I SUPPOSE IT LOOKS STRAIGHT
1841-179183-0017 NOW BROKEN OFF OR LENGTHENED OR SWELLING THEY RISE AND SINK BENEATH MY FINGERS THEY ARE FULL OF SUDDEN STARTS AND PAUSES AND THEIR VARIETY IS INEXHAUSTIBLE AND WONDERFUL SO YOU SEE I AM NOT SHUT OUT FROM THE REGION OF THE BEAUTIFUL
1841-179183-0018 THOUGH MY HAND CANNOT PERCEIVE THE BRILLIANT COLOURS IN THE SUNSET OR ON THE MOUNTAIN OR REACH INTO THE BLUE DEPTHS OF THE SKY PHYSICS TELLS ME THAT I AM WELL OFF IN A WORLD WHICH I AM TOLD KNOWS NEITHER COLD NOR SOUND
1841-179183-0019 FOR AT LEAST EVERY OBJECT APPEARS TO MY FINGERS STANDING SOLIDLY RIGHT SIDE UP AND IS NOT AN INVERTED IMAGE ON THE RETINA WHICH I UNDERSTAND YOUR BRAIN IS AT INFINITE THOUGH UNCONSCIOUS LABOUR TO SET BACK ON ITS FEET
1841-179183-0020 A TANGIBLE OBJECT PASSES COMPLETE INTO MY BRAIN WITH THE WARMTH OF LIFE UPON IT AND OCCUPIES THE SAME PLACE THAT IT DOES IN SPACE FOR WITHOUT EGOTISM THE MIND IS AS LARGE AS THE UNIVERSE
1841-179183-0021 WHEN I THINK OF HILLS I THINK OF THE UPWARD STRENGTH I TREAD UPON WHEN WATER IS THE OBJECT OF MY THOUGHT I FEEL THE COOL SHOCK OF THE PLUNGE AND THE QUICK YIELDING OF THE WAVES THAT CRISP AND CURL AND RIPPLE ABOUT MY BODY
1841-179183-0022 THE PLEASING CHANGES OF ROUGH AND SMOOTH PLIANT AND RIGID CURVED AND STRAIGHT IN THE BARK AND BRANCHES OF A TREE GIVE THE TRUTH TO MY HAND THE IMMOVABLE ROCK WITH ITS JUTS AND WARPED SURFACE
1841-179183-0023 A BIRD IN MY HAND WAS THEN WORTH TWO IN THE BARNYARD MY FINGERS CANNOT OF COURSE GET THE IMPRESSION OF A LARGE WHOLE AT A GLANCE BUT I FEEL THE PARTS AND MY MIND PUTS THEM TOGETHER
1841-179183-0024 I MOVE AROUND MY HOUSE TOUCHING OBJECT AFTER OBJECT IN ORDER BEFORE I CAN FORM AN IDEA OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE IN OTHER PEOPLE'S HOUSES I CAN TOUCH ONLY WHAT IS SHOWN TO ME THE CHIEF OBJECTS OF INTEREST
1841-179183-0025 CARVINGS ON THE WALL OR A CURIOUS ARCHITECTURAL FEATURE EXHIBITED LIKE THE FAMILY ALBUM THEREFORE A HOUSE WITH WHICH I AM NOT FAMILIAR HAS FOR ME AT FIRST NO GENERAL EFFECT OR HARMONY OF DETAIL
1841-179183-0026 IT IS NOT A COMPLETE CONCEPTION BUT A COLLECTION OF OBJECT IMPRESSIONS WHICH AS THEY COME TO ME ARE DISCONNECTED AND ISOLATED BUT MY MIND IS FULL OF ASSOCIATIONS SENSATIONS
1841-179183-0027 THEORIES AND WITH THEM IT CONSTRUCTS THE HOUSE THE PROCESS REMINDS ME OF THE BUILDING OF SOLOMON'S TEMPLE
1841-179183-0028 THE SILENT WORKER IS IMAGINATION WHICH DECREES REALITY OUT OF CHAOS WITHOUT IMAGINATION WHAT A POOR THING MY WORLD WOULD BE
1841-179183-0029 MY GARDEN WOULD BE A SILENT PATCH OF EARTH STREWN WITH STICKS OF A VARIETY OF SHAPES AND SMELLS BUT WHEN THE EYE OF MY MIND IS OPENED TO ITS BEAUTY THE BARE GROUND BRIGHTENS BENEATH MY FEET AND THE HEDGE ROW BURSTS INTO LEAF
1841-179183-0030 AND THE ROSE TREE SHAKES ITS FRAGRANCE EVERYWHERE I KNOW HOW BUDDING TREES LOOK AND I ENTER INTO THE AMOROUS JOY OF THE MATING BIRDS AND THIS IS THE MIRACLE OF IMAGINATION
1841-179183-0031 WHICH HE HAS EMBODIED IN A SCULPTURED FORM ALTHOUGH COMPARED WITH THE LIFE WARM MOBILE FACE OF A FRIEND THE MARBLE IS COLD AND PULSELESS AND UNRESPONSIVE YET IT IS BEAUTIFUL TO MY HAND
1841-179183-0032 ITS FLOWING CURVES AND BENDINGS ARE A REAL PLEASURE ONLY BREATH IS WANTING BUT UNDER THE SPELL OF THE IMAGINATION THE MARBLE THRILLS AND BECOMES THE DIVINE REALITY OF THE IDEAL IMAGINATION PUTS A SENTIMENT INTO EVERY LINE AND CURVE
1841-179183-0033 AND THE STATUE IN MY TOUCH IS INDEED THE GODDESS HERSELF WHO BREATHES AND MOVES AND ENCHANTS IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT SOME SCULPTURES EVEN RECOGNIZED MASTERPIECES DO NOT PLEASE MY HAND
1841-179183-0034 WHEN I TOUCH WHAT THERE IS OF THE WINGED VICTORY IT REMINDS ME AT FIRST OF A HEADLESS LIMBLESS DREAM THAT FLIES TOWARDS ME IN AN UNRESTFUL SLEEP
1841-179183-0035 THE GARMENTS OF THE VICTORY THRUST STIFFLY OUT BEHIND AND DO NOT RESEMBLE GARMENTS THAT I HAVE FELT FLYING FLUTTERING FOLDING SPREADING IN THE WIND
1841-179183-0036 BUT IMAGINATION FULFILS THESE IMPERFECTIONS AND STRAIGHTWAY THE VICTORY BECOMES A POWERFUL AND SPIRITED FIGURE WITH THE SWEEP OF SEA WINDS IN HER ROBES AND THE SPLENDOUR OF CONQUEST IN HER WINGS
1841-179183-0037 AND I LIKE THE LUXURIANT WAVY HAIR OF BACCHUS AND APOLLO AND THE WREATH OF IVY SO SUGGESTIVE OF PAGAN HOLIDAYS SO IMAGINATION CROWNS THE EXPERIENCE OF MY HANDS
1841-179183-0038 AND THEY LEARNED THEIR CUNNING FROM THE WISE HAND OF ANOTHER WHICH ITSELF GUIDED BY IMAGINATION LED ME SAFELY IN PATHS THAT I KNEW NOT
1867-148436-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE THE FIRST DAY MILE AFTER MILE OF THE ROUGH TRAIL FELL BEHIND HIM AND STILL THE PONY SHAMBLED ALONG AT A LOOSE TROT OR A SWINGING CANTER THE STEEP UPGRADES IT TOOK AT A STEADY JOG
1867-148436-0001 AND WHERE THE SLOPES PITCHED SHARPLY DOWN IT WOUND AMONG THE ROCKS WITH A FAULTLESS SURENESS OF FOOT CERTAINLY THE CHOICE OF NASH WAS WELL MADE AN EASTERN HORSE OF BLOOD OVER A LEVEL COURSE
1867-148436-0002 BUT IT WOULD HAVE BROKEN DOWN AFTER TEN MILES OF THAT HARD TRAIL DAWN CAME WHILE THEY WOUND OVER THE CREST OF THE RANGE AND WITH THE SUN IN THEIR FACES THEY TOOK THE DOWNGRADE IT WAS WELL INTO THE MORNING BEFORE NASH REACHED LOGAN

1867-148436-0011 HE SOUNDS LIKE A TENDERFOOT BUT HE AIN'T A TENDERFOOT FEELING THAT THIS PARTING SHOT GAVE HIM THE HONOURS OF THE MEETING HE TURNED AWAY WHISTLING WITH SUCH SPIRIT THAT ONE OF HIS DOGS OVERHEARING STOOD STILL AND GAZED AT HIS MASTER
1867-148436-0012 HIS EASTERN COURSE NASH PURSUED FOR A MILE OR MORE
1867-148436-0013 HE WAS WEARY LIKE HIS HORSE AND HE MADE NO ATTEMPT TO START A SUDDEN BURST OF SPEED HE LET THE PONY GO ON AT THE SAME TIRELESS JOG CLINGING LIKE A BULLDOG TO THE TRAIL ABOUT MIDDAY

1867-154071-0000 CHAPTER EIGHT TWO APPARITIONS
1867-154071-0001 FOUND A BIG DOUBLE ROOM THAT RAN ACROSS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE HOUSE FROM THE BACK IT LOOKED DOWN ON THE LIGHTS GLIMMERING ON THE BLACK EAST RIVER AND ACROSS TO THE FLARE OF BROOKLYN TO THE LEFT THE WHOLE ARC OF THE FIFTY NINTH STREET BRIDGE WAS EXPOSED
1867-154071-0002 HERE THEY TOOK UP THE VIGIL
1867-154071-0003 BILL GREGG SHOOK HIS HEAD THAT'S NOT THE ONE SHE'S ALL DIFFERENT A PILE DIFFERENT RONICKY RONICKY SIGHED
1867-154071-0004 GO ON BACK TO SLEEP I'LL CALL YOU AGAIN IF ANYTHING HAPPENS
1867-154071-0005 GHOST HOURS OF THE EARLY MORNING THEY DID NOT RELAX THEIR VIGIL
1867-154071-0006 APPARENTLY THE PLACE WAS A HARMLESS ROOMING HOUSE OF FAIRLY GOOD QUALITY NOT A SIGN OF CAROLINE SMITH APPEARED EVEN DURING THE SECOND DAY
1867-154071-0007 BY THIS TIME THE NERVES OF THE TWO WATCHERS WERE SHATTERED BY THE CONSTANT STRAIN AND THE MONOTONOUS VIEW FROM THE FRONT WINDOW WAS BEGINNING TO MADDEN THEM IT'S PROOF THAT SHE AIN'T YONDER SAID BILL GREGG
1867-154071-0008 AND HE GREW PALE AT THE THOUGHT PARTNER SAID RONICKY DOONE IF THEY ARE TRYING TO KEEP HER AWAY FROM US THEY SURE HAVE THE SENSE TO KEEP HER UNDER COVER FOR AS LONG AS TWO DAYS AIN'T THAT RIGHT
1867-154071-0009 IT'S JUST ABOUT OUR LAST CHANCE BILL WE'VE DONE OUR HUNTING PRETTY NEAR AS WELL AS WE COULD IF WE DON'T LAND HER THIS TRIP I'M ABOUT READY TO GIVE UP
1867-154071-0010 ONE WEEK WAS DECIDED ON AS A FAIR TEST IF AT THE END OF THAT TIME CAROLINE SMITH DID NOT COME OUT OF THE HOUSE ACROSS THE STREET THEY COULD CONCLUDE THAT SHE DID NOT STAY THERE
1867-154071-0011 PEERING THROUGH THE SLIT BETWEEN THE DRAWN CURTAINS WHICH SHELTERED HIM FROM BEING OBSERVED AT HIS SPYING WHEN HE CALLED OUT SOFTLY THE SOUND BROUGHT GREGG WITH ONE LONG LEAP OUT OF THE CHAIR WHERE HE WAS SLEEPING TO THE WINDOW THERE COULD BE NO SHADOW OF A DOUBT ABOUT IT
1867-154071-0012 THERE STOOD CAROLINE SMITH IN THE DOOR OF THE HOUSE SHE CLOSED THE DOOR BEHIND HER AND WALKING TO THE TOP OF THE STEPS PAUSED THERE AND LOOKED UP AND DOWN THE STREET BILL GREGG GROANED
1867-154071-0013 SNATCHED HIS HAT AND PLUNGED THROUGH THE DOOR AND RONICKY HEARD THE BRIEF THUNDER OF HIS FEET DOWN THE FIRST FLIGHT OF STAIRS THEN THE HEAVY THUMPS AS HE RACED AROUND THE LANDING
1867-154071-0014 AND SO SWIFT WAS THAT DESCENT THAT WHEN THE GIRL IDLING DOWN THE STEPS ACROSS THE STREET CAME ONTO THE SIDEWALK BILL GREGG RUSHED OUT FROM THE OTHER SIDE AND RAN TOWARD HER
1867-154071-0015 FOR NEVER HAD THE MINER SEEMED SO CLUMSILY BIG AND GAUNT NEVER HAD HIS CLOTHES SEEMED SO UNPRESSED AND SHAPELESS WHILE HIS SOFT GRAY HAT TO WHICH HE STILL CLUNG RELIGIOUSLY APPEARED HOPELESSLY OUT OF PLACE IN CONTRAST WITH THE SLIM PRETTINESS OF THE GIRL
1867-154071-0016 SHE WORE A BLACK STRAW HAT TURNED BACK FROM HER FACE WITH A SINGLE BIG RED FLOWER AT THE SIDE OF IT
1867-154071-0017 THE SAME DISTINCTION BETWEEN THEIR CLOTHES WAS IN THEIR FACES THE FINELY MODELED PRETTINESS OF HER FEATURES AND THE BIG CARELESS CHISELING OF THE FEATURES OF BILL GREGG RONICKY DOONE DID NOT WONDER THAT AFTER HER FIRST FEAR HER GESTURE WAS ONE OF DISDAIN AND SURPRISE
1867-154071-0018 HE WENT A LONG SLOW STEP CLOSER TO HER WITH BOTH HIS HANDS OUTSTRETCHED
1867-154071-0019 RONICKY DOONE FOLLOWED THAT GLANCE AND HE SAW ALL HIDDEN SAVE THE PROFILE OF THE FACE
1867-154071-0020 WHAT A FACE IT WAS NEVER IN HIS LIFE HAD RONICKY DOONE SEEN A MAN WHO IN ONE INSTANT FILLED HIM WITH SUCH FEAR AND HATRED SUCH LOATHING AND SUCH DREAD SUCH SCORN AND SUCH TERROR
1867-154071-0021 THE NOSE WAS HOOKED LIKE THE NOSE OF A BIRD OF PREY THE EYES WERE LONG AND SLANTING LIKE THOSE OF AN ORIENTAL THE FACE WAS THIN ALMOST FLESHLESS SO THAT THE BONY JAW STOOD OUT LIKE THE JAW OF A DEATH'S HEAD
1867-154071-0022 THE GIRL HESITATED A MOMENT
1867-154071-0023 FOR SHE MADE A SLIGHT OUTWARD GESTURE WITH ONE HAND IF THIS WERE IN HER MIND HOWEVER IT VANISHED INSTANTLY SHE TURNED WITH A SHUDDER AND HURRIED AWAY DOWN THE STREET
1867-154071-0024 AS FOR BILL GREGG HE BORE HIMSELF STRAIGHT AS A SOLDIER AND CAME BACK ACROSS THE PAVEMENT BUT IT WAS THE ERECTNESS OF A SOLDIER WHO HAS MET WITH A CRUSHING DEFEAT AND ONLY PRESERVES AN OUTWARD RESOLUTION WHILE ALL THE SPIRIT WITHIN IS CRUSHED
1867-154071-0025 WHAT A CONTRAST BETWEEN THE ASCENT AND THE DESCENT HE HAD LITERALLY FLOWN DOWN NOW HIS HEELS CLUMPED OUT A SLOW AND REGULAR DEATH MARCH AS HE CAME BACK TO THE ROOM WHEN GREGG OPENED THE DOOR
1867-154071-0026 RONICKY DOONE BLINKED AND DREW IN A DEEP BREATH AT THE SIGHT OF THE POOR FELLOW'S FACE GREGG HAD KNOWN BEFORE THAT HE TRULY LOVED THIS GIRL WHOM HE HAD NEVER SEEN
1867-154071-0027 NOW IN THE VERY MOMENT OF SEEING HIS DREAM OF THE GIRL TURNED INTO FLESH AND BLOOD HE HAD LOST HER AND THERE WAS SOMETHING LIKE DEATH IN THE FACE OF THE BIG MINER AS HE DROPPED HIS HAT ON THE FLOOR AND SANK INTO A CHAIR
1867-154071-0028 AFTER THAT HE DID NOT MOVE SO MUCH AS A FINGER FROM THE POSITION INTO WHICH HE HAD FALLEN LIMPLY HIS LEGS WERE TWISTED AWKWARDLY SPRAWLING ACROSS THE FLOOR IN FRONT OF HIM ONE LONG ARM DRAGGED DOWN TOWARD THE FLOOR
1867-154071-0029 AS IF THERE WAS NO STRENGTH IN IT TO SUPPORT THE WEIGHT OF THE LABOR HARDENED HANDS HIS CHIN WAS FALLEN AGAINST HIS BREAST WHEN RONICKY DOONE CROSSED TO HIM AND LAID A KIND HAND ON HIS SHOULDER HE DID NOT LOOK UP IT'S ENDED
1867-154071-0030 SAID BILL GREGG FAINTLY NOW WE HIT THE BACK TRAIL AND FORGET ALL ABOUT THIS HE ADDED WITH A FAINT ATTEMPT AT CYNICISM I'VE JUST WASTED A PILE OF GOOD MONEY MAKING TIME FROM THE MINE THAT'S ALL
1867-154071-0031 SAID RONICKY DOONE BILL LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME MAN TO MAN THAT YOU'RE A LIAR HE ADDED CAN YOU EVER BE HAPPY WITHOUT HER MAN THE CRUELTY OF THAT SPEECH MADE GREGG FLUSH
1867-154071-0032 SAID GREGG HUSKILY AIN'T THERE THAT'S WHERE YOU AND ME DON'T AGREE

1898-145702-0002 THEY SAT FOR TWO DAYS AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE CORN AND GREW SO HUNGRY THAT THEY NEARLY DIED BUT IF THEY WERE TO VENTURE OUT IT WAS CERTAIN DEATH THEY SAID AT LAST
1898-145702-0003 WHAT USE WAS IT OUR DESERTING WE MUST PERISH HERE MISERABLY WHILST THEY WERE SPEAKING A FIERY DRAGON CAME FLYING THROUGH THE AIR
1898-145702-0004 SAID THEY THEN THE DRAGON SEIZED THEM IN HIS CLAWS TOOK THEM THROUGH THE AIR OVER THE ARMY AND SET THEM DOWN ON THE EARTH A LONG WAY FROM IT HE GAVE THEM A LITTLE WHIP SAYING
1898-145702-0005 THEN HE PUT A BOOK BEFORE THEM WHICH HE MADE ALL THREE OF THEM SIGN I WILL THEN GIVE YOU A RIDDLE HE SAID IF YOU GUESS IT YOU SHALL BE FREE AND OUT OF MY POWER THE DRAGON THEN FLEW AWAY
1898-145702-0006 AND THEY JOURNEYED ON WITH THEIR LITTLE WHIP THEY HAD AS MUCH MONEY AS THEY WANTED WORE GRAND CLOTHES AND MADE THEIR WAY INTO THE WORLD WHEREVER THEY WENT THEY LIVED IN MERRYMAKING AND SPLENDOUR DROVE ABOUT WITH HORSES AND CARRIAGES ATE AND DRANK BUT DID NOTHING WRONG
1898-145702-0007 THEY WENT INTO A FIELD SAT DOWN AND THE TWO PULLED LONG FACES AN OLD WOMAN PASSED BY AND ASKED THEM WHY THEY WERE SO SAD
1898-145702-0008 ONLY CONFIDE YOUR TROUBLE IN ME
1898-145702-0009 AND HOW HE HAD GIVEN THEM MONEY AS PLENTIFULLY AS BLACKBERRIES BUT AS THEY HAD SIGNED THEIR NAMES THEY WERE HIS UNLESS WHEN THE SEVEN YEARS HAD PASSED THEY COULD GUESS A RIDDLE THE OLD WOMAN SAID
1898-145702-0010 IF YOU WOULD HELP YOURSELVES ONE OF YOU MUST GO INTO THE WOOD AND THERE HE WILL COME UPON A TUMBLE DOWN BUILDING OF ROCKS WHICH LOOKS LIKE A LITTLE HOUSE HE MUST GO IN AND THERE HE WILL FIND HELP THE TWO MELANCHOLY ONES THOUGHT
1898-145702-0011 THAT WON'T SAVE US AND THEY REMAINED WHERE THEY WERE BUT THE THIRD AND MERRY ONE JUMPED UP AND WENT INTO THE WOOD TILL HE FOUND THE ROCK HUT IN THE HUT SAT A VERY OLD WOMAN WHO WAS THE DRAGON'S GRANDMOTHER
1898-145702-0012 SHE ASKED HIM HOW HE CAME AND WHAT WAS HIS BUSINESS THERE HE TOLD HER ALL THAT HAPPENED AND BECAUSE SHE WAS PLEASED WITH HIM SHE TOOK COMPASSION ON HIM
1898-145702-0013 I WILL TELL YOU THIS IN THE NORTH SEA LIES A DEAD SEA CAT THAT SHALL BE THEIR ROAST MEAT AND THE RIB OF A WHALE THAT SHALL BE THEIR SILVER SPOON AND THE HOLLOW FOOT OF A DEAD HORSE THAT SHALL BE THEIR WINEGLASS
1898-145702-0014 I KNOW ENOUGH AND CAN HELP MYSELF SPLENDIDLY THEN HE WENT BY ANOTHER WAY THROUGH THE WINDOW SECRETLY AND IN ALL HASTE BACK TO HIS COMRADES HE TOLD THEM HOW THE DRAGON HAD BEEN OUTWITTED BY HIS GRANDMOTHER
1898-145702-0015 AND HOW HE HAD HEARD FROM HIS OWN LIPS THE ANSWER TO THE RIDDLE THEN THEY WERE ALL DELIGHTED AND IN HIGH SPIRITS TOOK OUT THEIR WHIP AND CRACKED SO MUCH MONEY THAT IT CAME JUMPING UP FROM THE GROUND WHEN THE SEVEN YEARS HAD QUITE GONE THE FIEND CAME WITH HIS BOOK AND
1898-145702-0016 POINTING AT THE SIGNATURES SAID I WILL TAKE YOU UNDERGROUND WITH ME YOU SHALL HAVE A MEAL THERE IF YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT YOU WILL GET FOR YOUR ROAST MEAT YOU SHALL BE FREE
1898-145702-0017 THEN SAID THE FIRST SOLDIER
1898-145702-0018 THE DRAGON MADE A FACE AND GROWLED AGAIN THREE TIMES HUM
1898-145702-0019 DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR WINEGLASS SHALL BE AN OLD HORSE'S HOOF SHALL BE OUR WINEGLASS
1898-145715-0000 ONCE THERE LIVED A KING WHO HAD NO CHILDREN FOR MANY YEARS AFTER HIS MARRIAGE AT LENGTH HEAVEN GRANTED HIM A DAUGHTER OF SUCH REMARKABLE BEAUTY THAT HE COULD THINK OF NO NAME SO APPROPRIATE FOR HER AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY
1898-145715-0001 THAN THEY RESOLVED TO GAIN POSSESSION OF HER WHO BORE IT AND EITHER TO TORMENT HER CRUELLY OR AT LEAST TO CONCEAL HER FROM THE EYES OF ALL MEN THE ELDEST OF THEIR TRIBE WAS ENTRUSTED TO CARRY OUT THEIR REVENGE THIS FAIRY WAS NAMED LAGREE
1898-145715-0002 SHE WAS SO OLD THAT SHE ONLY HAD ONE EYE AND ONE TOOTH LEFT
1898-145715-0003 SHE WAS ALSO SO SPITEFUL THAT SHE GLADLY DEVOTED ALL HER TIME TO CARRYING OUT ALL THE MEAN OR ILL NATURED TRICKS OF THE WHOLE BODY OF FAIRIES WITH HER LARGE EXPERIENCE ADDED TO HER NATIVE SPITE
1898-145715-0004 SHE FELT A LITTLE REASSURED AND WAS FURTHER CHEERED WHEN SHE DISCOVERED THAT HER PET CAT AND DOG HAD FOLLOWED HER
1898-145715-0005 AT THE SAME TIME GIVING HER THE STRICTEST ORDERS NEVER TO LET OUT THE FIRE WHICH WAS BURNING BRIGHTLY IN THE GRATE SHE THEN GAVE TWO GLASS BOTTLES INTO THE PRINCESS'S CHARGE DESIRING HER TO TAKE THE GREATEST CARE OF THEM
1898-145715-0006 AND HAVING ENFORCED HER ORDERS WITH THE MOST AWFUL THREATS IN CASE OF DISOBEDIENCE SHE VANISHED LEAVING THE LITTLE GIRL AT LIBERTY TO EXPLORE THE PALACE
1898-145715-0007 SEVERAL YEARS PASSED DURING WHICH TIME THE PRINCESS GREW ACCUSTOMED TO HER LONELY LIFE OBEYED THE FAIRY'S ORDERS AND BY DEGREES FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE COURT OF THE KING HER FATHER
1898-145715-0008 SHE NOTICED THAT THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO PRODUCE A BRILLIANT RAINBOW SHE STOOD STILL TO ADMIRE IT WHEN TO HER GREAT SURPRISE SHE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESSING HER WHICH SEEMED TO COME FROM THE CENTRE OF ITS RAYS
1898-145715-0009 THE VOICE WAS THAT OF A YOUNG MAN AND ITS SWEETNESS OF TONE AND THE AGREEABLE THINGS IT UTTERED LED ONE TO INFER THAT ITS OWNER MUST BE EQUALLY CHARMING BUT THIS HAD TO BE A MERE MATTER OF FANCY FOR NO ONE WAS VISIBLE
1898-145715-0010 THE BEAUTIFUL RAINBOW INFORMED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THAT HE WAS YOUNG THE SON OF A POWERFUL KING AND THAT THE FAIRY LAGREE WHO OWED HIS PARENTS A GRUDGE
1898-145715-0011 HAD REVENGED HERSELF BY DEPRIVING HIM OF HIS NATURAL SHAPE FOR SOME YEARS THAT SHE HAD IMPRISONED HIM IN THE PALACE WHERE HE HAD FOUND HIS CONFINEMENT HARD TO BEAR FOR SOME TIME BUT NOW HE OWNED
1898-145715-0012 HE NO LONGER SIGHED FOR FREEDOM SINCE HE HAD SEEN AND LEARNED TO LOVE FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HE ADDED MANY OTHER TENDER SPEECHES TO THIS DECLARATION AND THE PRINCESS TO WHOM SUCH REMARKS WERE A NEW EXPERIENCE
1898-145715-0013 COULD NOT HELP FEELING PLEASED AND TOUCHED BY HIS ATTENTIONS THE PRINCE COULD ONLY APPEAR OR SPEAK UNDER THE FORM OF A RAINBOW AND IT WAS THEREFORE NECESSARY THAT THE SUN SHOULD SHINE ON WATER SO AS TO ENABLE THE RAYS TO FORM THEMSELVES
1898-145715-0014 LAGREE ON HER RETURN SOON FOUND OUT THE NEGLECT AND SEEMED ONLY TOO PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING HER SPITE TO HER LOVELY PRISONER
1898-145715-0015 FOR FIRE WITH WHICH TO RELIGHT THE ONE SHE HAD ALLOWED TO GO OUT NOW THIS LOCRINOS WAS A CRUEL MONSTER WHO DEVOURED EVERYONE HE CAME ACROSS AND ESPECIALLY ENJOYED A CHANCE OF CATCHING
1898-145715-0016 AND EATING ANY YOUNG GIRLS OUR HEROINE OBEYED WITH GREAT SWEETNESS AND WITHOUT HAVING BEEN ABLE TO TAKE LEAVE OF HER LOVER
1898-145715-0017 AS TO CERTAIN DEATH AS SHE WAS CROSSING A WOOD A BIRD SANG TO HER TO PICK UP A SHINING PEBBLE WHICH SHE WOULD FIND IN A FOUNTAIN CLOSE BY AND TO USE IT WHEN NEEDED
1898-145715-0018 SHE TOOK THE BIRD'S ADVICE AND IN DUE TIME ARRIVED AT THE HOUSE OF LOCRINOS LUCKILY SHE ONLY FOUND HIS WIFE AT HOME WHO WAS MUCH STRUCK BY THE PRINCESS'S YOUTH AND BEAUTY AND SWEET GENTLE MANNERS
1898-145715-0019 SHE READILY LET FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAVE THE FIRE
1898-145715-0020 CONVENIENT WAY OF MEETING THAN BY THE GARDEN FOUNTAIN AND FAIRER THAN A FAIRY CARRIED OUT HIS PLAN DAILY WITH ENTIRE SUCCESS EVERY MORNING SHE PLACED A LARGE BASIN FULL OF WATER ON HER WINDOW SILL AND AS SOON AS THE SUN'S RAYS FELL ON THE WATER
1898-145715-0021 THE RAINBOW APPEARED AS CLEARLY AS IT HAD EVER DONE IN THE FOUNTAIN BY THIS MEANS THEY WERE ABLE TO MEET WITHOUT LOSING SIGHT OF THE FIRE OR OF THE TWO BOTTLES IN WHICH THE OLD FAIRY KEPT HER EYE AND HER TOOTH AT NIGHT
1898-145715-0022 AND FOR SOME TIME THE LOVERS ENJOYED EVERY HOUR OF SUNSHINE TOGETHER ONE DAY PRINCE RAINBOW APPEARED IN THE DEPTHS OF WOE HE HAD JUST HEARD THAT HE WAS TO BE BANISHED FROM THIS LOVELY SPOT BUT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE HE WAS TO GO
1898-145715-0023 THE POOR YOUNG COUPLE WERE IN DESPAIR AND ONLY PARTED WITH THE LAST RAY OF SUNSHINE AND IN HOPES OF MEETING NEXT MORNING ALAS NEXT DAY WAS DARK AND GLOOMY AND IT WAS ONLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON THAT THE SUN BROKE THROUGH THE CLOUDS FOR A FEW MINUTES
1898-145715-0024 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY EAGERLY RAN TO THE WINDOW BUT IN HER HASTE SHE UPSET THE BASIN AND SPILT ALL THE WATER WITH WHICH SHE HAD CAREFULLY FILLED IT OVERNIGHT NO OTHER WATER WAS AT HAND EXCEPT THAT IN THE TWO BOTTLES
1898-145715-0025 IT WAS THE ONLY CHANCE OF SEEING HER LOVER BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED AND SHE DID NOT HESITATE TO BREAK THE BOTTLE AND POUR THEIR CONTENTS INTO THE BASIN WHEN THE RAINBOW APPEARED AT ONCE THEIR FAREWELLS WERE FULL OF TENDERNESS
1898-145715-0026 THE PRINCE MADE THE MOST ARDENT AND SINCERE PROTESTATIONS AND PROMISED TO NEGLECT NOTHING WHICH MIGHT HELP TO DELIVER HIS DEAR FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FROM HER CAPTIVITY AND IMPLORED HER TO CONSENT TO THEIR MARRIAGE AS SOON AS THEY SHOULD BOTH BE FREE
1898-145715-0027 THE PRINCESS ON HER SIDE VOWED TO HAVE NO OTHER HUSBAND AND DECLARED HERSELF WILLING TO BRAVE DEATH ITSELF IN ORDER TO REJOIN HIM THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED MUCH TIME FOR THEIR ADIEUS THE RAINBOW VANISHED AND THE PRINCESS RESOLVED TO RUN ALL RISKS
1898-145715-0028 STARTED OFF AT ONCE TAKING NOTHING WITH HER BUT HER DOG HER CAT A SPRIG OF MYRTLE AND THE STONE WHICH THE WIFE OF LOCRINOS GAVE HER WHEN LAGREE BECAME AWARE OF HER PRISONER'S FLIGHT
1898-145715-0029 AS SHE DID SO THE SPRIG OF MYRTLE SHE CARRIED TOUCHED THE GROUND AND IMMEDIATELY A GREEN AND SHADY BOWER SPRANG UP ROUND HER IN WHICH SHE HOPED TO SLEEP IN PEACE BUT LAGREE HAD NOT GIVEN UP HER PURSUIT
1898-145715-0030 AND ARRIVED JUST AS FAIRER THAN A FAIRY HAD FALLEN FAST ASLEEP THIS TIME SHE MADE SURE OF CATCHING HER VICTIM BUT THE CAT SPIED HER OUT
1898-145715-0031 SHE FLEW AT LAGREE'S FACE AND TORE OUT HER ONLY EYE THUS DELIVERING THE PRINCESS FOR EVER FROM HER PERSECUTOR
1898-145715-0032 BUT NO SOONER HAD LAGREE BEEN PUT TO FIGHT THAN OUR HEROINE WAS OVERWHELMED WITH HUNGER AND THIRST SHE FELT AS THOUGH SHE SHOULD CERTAINLY EXPIRE AND IT WAS WITH SOME DIFFICULTY THAT SHE DRAGGED HERSELF AS FAR
1898-145715-0033 WHICH STOOD AT NO GREAT DISTANCE HERE SHE WAS RECEIVED BY A BEAUTIFUL LADY DRESSED IN GREEN AND WHITE TO MATCH THE HOUSE WHICH APPARENTLY BELONGED TO HER AND OF WHICH SHE SEEMED THE ONLY INHABITANT
1898-145715-0034 SHE GAVE HER A NUT DESIRING HER ONLY TO OPEN IT IN THE MOST URGENT NEED AFTER A LONG AND TIRING JOURNEY FAIRER THAN A FAIRY WAS ONCE MORE RECEIVED IN A HOUSE AND BY A LADY EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE SHE
1898-145715-0035 HERE AGAIN SHE RECEIVED A PRESENT WITH THE SAME INJUNCTIONS
1898-145715-0036 THAT THEY WISHED THEIR HOUSES AND GARMENTS TO BE EQUALLY ALIKE THEIR OCCUPATION CONSISTED IN HELPING THOSE IN MISFORTUNE AND THEY WERE AS GENTLE AND BENEVOLENT AS LAGREE HAD BEEN CRUEL AND SPITEFUL THE THIRD FAIRY COMFORTED THE POOR TRAVELLER
1898-145715-0037 BEGGED HER NOT TO LOSE HEART AND ASSURED HER THAT HER TROUBLES SHOULD BE REWARDED SHE ACCOMPANIED HER ADVICE BY THE GIFT OF A CRYSTAL SMELLING BOTTLE WITH STRICT ORDERS ONLY TO OPEN IT IN CASE OF URGENT NEED
1898-145715-0038 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY THANKED HER WARMLY AND RESUMED HER WAY CHEERED BY PLEASANT THOUGHTS AFTER A TIME HER ROAD LED THROUGH A WOOD FULL OF SOFT AIRS AND SWEET ODOURS AND BEFORE SHE HAD GONE A HUNDRED YARDS SHE SAW A WONDERFUL SILVER CASTLE
1898-145715-0039 FAIRER THAN A FAIRY FELT A STRONG DESIRE TO ENTER THIS CASTLE BUT BESIDES BEING HUNG A LITTLE ABOVE THE GROUND THERE SEEMED TO BE NEITHER DOORS NOR WINDOWS SHE HAD NO DOUBT THOUGH REALLY I CANNOT THINK WHY
1898-145715-0040 THAT THE MOMENT HAD COME IN WHICH TO USE THE NUT WHICH HAD BEEN GIVEN HER SHE OPENED IT AND OUT CAME A DIMINUTIVE HALL PORTER
1898-145715-0041 YOU EVER SAW THE PRINCESS CLIMBED UP ONE OF THE SILVER CHAINS HOLDING IN HER HAND THE LITTLE PORTER WHO IN SPITE OF HIS MINUTE SIZE OPENED A SECRET DOOR WITH HIS GOLDEN KEY AND LET HER IN
1898-145715-0042 SHE ENTERED A MAGNIFICENT ROOM WHICH APPEARED TO OCCUPY THE ENTIRE CASTLE AND WHICH WAS LIGHTED BY GOLD AND JEWELLED STARS IN THE CEILING
1898-145715-0043 WHO NOW SAW HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS REAL SHAPE
1898-145715-0044 ON OPENING IT FOUND THAT ALL THE SEEDS WERE AS MANY LITTLE VIOLINS WHICH FLEW UP IN THE VAULTED ROOF AND AT ONCE BEGAN PLAYING MELODIOUSLY
1898-145715-0045 THE PRINCE WAS NOT COMPLETELY ROUSED BUT HE OPENED HIS EYES A LITTLE AND LOOKED ALL THE HANDSOMER IMPATIENT AT NOT BEING RECOGNISED FAIRER THAN A FAIRY NOW DREW OUT HER THIRD PRESENT AND ON OPENING THE CRYSTAL SCENT BOTTLE A LITTLE SYREN FLEW OUT
1898-145715-0046 AT THE SAME MOMENT THE WALLS OF THE ROOM EXPANDED AND OPENED OUT REVEALING A GOLDEN THRONE COVERED WITH JEWELS
1898-145715-0047 IN THE FIRST AND MOST SPLENDID OF THESE CARRIAGES SAT PRINCE RAINBOW'S MOTHER SHE FONDLY EMBRACED HER SON AFTER WHICH SHE INFORMED HIM THAT HIS FATHER HAD BEEN DEAD FOR SOME YEARS THAT THE ANGER OF THE FAIRIES WAS AT LENGTH APPEASED
1898-145715-0048 AND THAT HE MIGHT RETURN IN PEACE TO REIGN OVER HIS PEOPLE WHO WERE LONGING FOR HIS PRESENCE THE COURT RECEIVED THE NEW KING WITH JOYFUL ACCLAMATIONS WHICH WOULD HAVE DELIGHTED HIM AT ANY OTHER TIME
1898-145715-0049 HE WAS JUST ABOUT TO PRESENT HER TO HIS MOTHER AND THE COURT
1898-145715-0050 CHARMS WOULD WIN ALL HEARTS WHEN THE THREE GREEN AND WHITE SISTERS APPEARED THEY DECLARED THE SECRET OF FAIRY THAN A FAIRY'S ROYAL BIRTH AND THE QUEEN TAKING THE TWO LOVERS IN HER CARRIAGE SET OFF WITH THEM FOR THE CAPITAL OF THE KINGDOM
1898-145720-0000 FAR AWAY IN NORTH AMERICA WHERE THE RED INDIANS DWELL
1898-145720-0001 MANY OF THE YOUNG BRAVES SOUGHT HER IN MARRIAGE BUT SHE WOULD LISTEN TO ONE ONLY A HANDSOME CHIEF WHO HAD TAKEN HER FANCY SOME YEARS BEFORE SO THEY WERE TO BE MARRIED AND GREAT REJOICINGS WERE MADE
1898-145720-0002 BUT FROM SUNRISE TO SUNSET HE SAT BY THE PLACE WHERE SHE WAS LAID THINKING OF HIS HAPPINESS THAT WAS BURIED THERE AT LAST AFTER MANY DAYS A LIGHT SEEMED TO COME TO HIM OUT OF THE DARKNESS
1898-145720-0003 HE REMEMBERED HAVING HEARD FROM THE OLD OLD PEOPLE OF THE TRIBE THAT THERE WAS A PATH THAT LED TO THE LAND OF SOULS THAT IF YOU SOUGHT CAREFULLY YOU COULD FIND IT
1898-145720-0004 SO THE NEXT MORNING HE GOT UP EARLY AND PUT SOME FOOD IN HIS POUCH AND SLUNG AN EXTRA SKIN OVER HIS SHOULDERS FOR HE KNEW NOT HOW LONG HIS JOURNEY WOULD TAKE NOR WHAT SORT OF COUNTRY HE WOULD HAVE TO GO THROUGH ONLY ONE THING HE KNEW
1898-145720-0005 ONE OF THE OLD MEN SAY THAT THE LAND OF SOULS LAY TO THE SOUTH AND SO FILLED WITH NEW HOPE AND COURAGE HE SET HIS FACE SOUTHWARDS FOR MANY MANY MILES THE COUNTRY LOOKED THE SAME AS IT DID ROUND HIS OWN HOME
1898-145720-0006 BUT GREW LESS AND LESS THE FARTHER HE WENT SOUTH TILL IT DISAPPEARED ALTOGETHER SOON THE TREES PUT FORTH THEIR BUDS AND FLOWERS SPRANG UP UNDER HIS FEET AND INSTEAD OF THICK CLOUDS THERE WAS BLUE SKY OVER HIS HEAD AND EVERYWHERE THE BIRDS WERE SINGING
1898-145720-0007 AND ON THE TOP OF THESE HE FOUND A HUT OR WIGWAM AN OLD MAN CLOTHED IN SKINS AND HOLDING A STAFF IN HIS HAND STOOD IN THE DOORWAY
1898-145720-0008 REST IN MY HUT AS SHE ALSO RESTED AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT YOU ASK AND WHITHER YOU SHOULD GO ON HEARING THESE WORDS THE YOUNG MAN ENTERED THE HUT BUT HIS HEART WAS TOO EAGER WITHIN HIM
1898-145720-0009 TO SUFFER HIM TO REST AND WHEN HE AROSE THE OLD MAN ROSE TOO AND STOOD WITH HIM AT THE DOOR LOOK HE SAID
1898-145720-0010 AT THE WATER WHICH LIES FAR OUT YONDER AND THE PLAINS WHICH STRETCH BEYOND
1898-145720-0011 BUT NO MAN ENTERS IT WITHOUT LEAVING HIS BODY BEHIND HIM
1898-145720-0012 INSTEAD OF HIDING AS HE APPROACHED AND BIRDS CIRCLED ROUND HIM
1898-145720-0013 VERY SOON HE NOTICED WITH WONDER THAT NEITHER ROCKS NOR TREES BARRED HIS PATH HE PASSED THROUGH THEM WITHOUT KNOWING IT FOR INDEED THEY WERE NOT ROCKS AND TREES AT ALL BUT ONLY THE SOULS OF THEM FOR THIS WAS THE LAND OF SHADOWS
1898-145720-0014 WHEN TO HIS JOY AND WONDER HE SAW FOLLOWING HIM IN ANOTHER CANOE EXACTLY LIKE HIS OWN THE MAIDEN FOR WHOSE SAKE HE HAD MADE THIS LONG JOURNEY BUT THEY COULD NOT TOUCH EACH OTHER FOR BETWEEN THEM ROLLED GREAT WAVES WHICH LOOKED AS IF THEY WOULD SINK THE BOATS
1898-145720-0015 ONLY THE CHILDREN HAD NO FEAR AND REACHED THE OTHER SIDE IN SAFETY STILL THOUGH THE CHIEF AND THE YOUNG GIRL QUAILED IN TERROR AT THESE HORRIBLE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS NO HARM CAME TO THEM FOR THEIR LIVES HAD BEEN FREE FROM EVIL
1898-145720-0016 SO THEY REACHED UNHURT THE SHORE OF THE HAPPY ISLAND AND WANDERED THROUGH THE FLOWERY FIELDS AND BY THE BANKS OF RUSHING STREAMS AND THEY KNEW NOT HUNGER NOR THIRST NEITHER COLD NOR HEAT
1898-145720-0017 BUT IN THE MURMUR OF THE WIND HE HEARD THE MASTER OF LIFE SAYING TO HIM RETURN WHITHER YOU CAME FOR I HAVE WORK FOR YOU TO DO AND YOUR PEOPLE NEED YOU AND FOR MANY YEARS YOU SHALL RULE OVER THEM
1898-145720-0018 AT THE GATE MY MESSENGER AWAITS YOU AND YOU SHALL TAKE AGAIN
1898-145724-0000 TO HIS ASTONISHMENT HE FOUND AN OLD WOMAN WHO BEGGED HIM TO HELP HER OUT OF THE DITCH THE PRINCE BENT DOWN AND LIFTED HER OUT OF HER LIVING GRAVE ASKING HER AT THE SAME TIME HOW SHE HAD MANAGED TO GET THERE MY SON
1898-145724-0001 ANSWERED THE OLD WOMAN I AM A VERY POOR WOMAN AND SOON AFTER MIDNIGHT I SET OUT FOR THE NEIGHBOURING TOWN IN ORDER TO SELL MY EGGS IN THE MARKET ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING BUT I LOST MY WAY IN THE DARK
1898-145724-0002 OVER THERE AT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST IN THE LITTLE HUT YOU SEE IN THE DISTANCE REPLIED THE OLD WOMAN THE PRINCE LIFTED HER ON TO HIS HORSE AND SOON THEY REACHED THE HUT WHERE THE OLD WOMAN GOT DOWN AND TURNING TO THE PRINCE SAID
1898-145724-0003 JUST WAIT A MOMENT AND I WILL GIVE YOU SOMETHING AND SHE DISAPPEARED INTO HER HUT BUT RETURNED VERY SOON AND SAID YOU ARE A MIGHTY PRINCE BUT AT THE SAME
1898-145724-0004 WHICH DESERVES TO BE REWARDED WOULD YOU LIKE TO HAVE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL WOMAN IN THE WORLD FOR YOUR WIFE MOST CERTAINLY I WOULD REPLIED THE PRINCE SO THE OLD WOMAN CONTINUED
1898-145724-0005 WHO HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY A DRAGON IF YOU WISH TO MARRY HER YOU MUST FIRST SET HER FREE AND THIS I WILL HELP YOU TO DO I WILL GIVE YOU THIS LITTLE BELL IF YOU RING IT ONCE
1898-145724-0006 THE KING OF THE EAGLES WILL APPEAR IF YOU RING IT TWICE THE KING OF THE FOXES WILL COME TO YOU AND IF YOU RING IT THREE TIMES YOU WILL SEE THE KING OF THE FISHES BY YOUR SIDE
1898-145724-0007 AND INTENDED SETTING OUT ON THE FOLLOWING DAY INTO THE WIDE WORLD IN SEARCH OF THE MAID SO THE NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE MOUNTED HIS FINE HORSE AND LEFT HIS HOME
1898-145724-0008 AND HIS HORSE HAD DIED OF EXHAUSTION WHILE HE HIMSELF HAD SUFFERED MUCH FROM WANT AND MISERY BUT STILL HE HAD COME ON NO TRACE OF HER HE WAS IN SEARCH OF AT LAST ONE DAY HE CAME TO A HUT IN FRONT OF WHICH SAT A VERY OLD MAN
1898-145724-0009 NO I DO NOT ANSWERED THE OLD MAN
1898-145724-0010 THE PRINCE THANKED HIM FOR HIS INFORMATION AND CONTINUED HIS JOURNEY FOR A WHOLE YEAR ALONG THE SAME ROAD AND AT THE END OF IT CAME TO THE LITTLE HUT WHERE HE FOUND A VERY OLD MAN
1898-145724-0011 HE ASKED HIM THE SAME QUESTION AND THE OLD MAN ANSWERED NO
1898-145724-0012 WITH DIAMOND WINDOWS HE OPENED THE BIG GATE LEADING INTO THE COURTYARD
1898-145724-0013 WHEN SEVEN DRAGONS RUSHED ON HIM AND ASKED HIM WHAT HE WANTED THE PRINCE REPLIED
1898-145724-0014 WOULD LIKE TO ENTER HER SERVICE THIS FLATTERING SPEECH PLEASED THE DRAGONS AND THE ELDEST OF THEM SAID WELL YOU MAY COME WITH ME AND I WILL TAKE YOU TO THE MOTHER DRAGON
1898-145724-0015 THEY ENTERED THE CASTLE AND WALKED THROUGH TWELVE SPLENDID HALLS ALL MADE OF GOLD AND DIAMONDS IN THE TWELFTH ROOM THEY FOUND THE MOTHER DRAGON SEATED ON A DIAMOND THRONE SHE WAS THE
1898-145724-0016 AND ADDED TO IT ALL SHE HAD THREE HEADS HER APPEARANCE WAS A GREAT SHOCK TO THE PRINCE AND SO WAS HER VOICE WHICH WAS LIKE THE CROAKING OF MANY RAVENS SHE ASKED HIM
1898-145724-0017 VERY WELL
1898-145724-0018 WE WILL EAT YOU UP THE PRINCE UNDERTOOK THE TASK AND LED THE MARE OUT TO THE MEADOW
1898-145724-0019 AND AT LAST IN DESPAIR SAT DOWN ON A BIG STONE AND CONTEMPLATED HIS SAD FATE AS HE SAT THUS LOST IN THOUGHT HE NOTICED AN EAGLE FLYING OVER HIS HEAD THEN HE SUDDENLY BETHOUGHT HIM OF HIS LITTLE BELL
1898-145724-0020 AND TAKING IT OUT OF HIS POCKET HE RANG IT ONCE IN A MOMENT HE HEARD A RUSTLING SOUND IN THE AIR BESIDE HIM AND THE KING OF THE EAGLES SANK AT HIS FEET
1898-145724-0021 THE BIRD SAID YOU ARE LOOKING FOR THE MOTHER DRAGON'S MARE WHO IS GALLOPING ABOUT AMONG THE CLOUDS I WILL SUMMON ALL THE EAGLES OF THE AIR TOGETHER AND ORDER THEM TO CATCH THE MARE AND BRING HER TO YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS THE KING OF THE EAGLES FLEW AWAY
1898-145724-0022 TOWARDS EVENING THE PRINCE HEARD A MIGHTY RUSHING SOUND IN THE AIR AND WHEN HE LOOKED UP HE SAW THOUSANDS OF EAGLES DRIVING THE MARE BEFORE THEM THEY SANK AT HIS FEET ON TO THE GROUND AND GAVE THE MARE OVER TO HIM THEN THE PRINCE RODE HOME TO THE OLD MOTHER DRAGON
1898-145724-0023 WHO WAS FULL OF WONDER WHEN SHE SAW HIM AND SAID
1898-145724-0024 SHE GAVE HIM AT THE SAME TIME A CLOAK MADE OF COPPER
1898-145724-0025 HERE TOO WAS THE FLOWER QUEEN'S BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER HER DRESS WAS WOVEN OUT OF THE MOST LOVELY FLOWERS IN THE WORLD AND HER COMPLEXION WAS LIKE LILIES AND ROSES AS THE PRINCE WAS DANCING WITH HER HE MANAGED TO WHISPER IN HER EAR
1898-145724-0026 THE BALL CAME TO AN END AT MIDNIGHT AND EARLY NEXT MORNING THE PRINCE AGAIN LED THE MOTHER DRAGON'S MARE OUT INTO THE MEADOW BUT AGAIN SHE VANISHED BEFORE HIS EYES THEN HE TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BELL AND RANG IT TWICE
1898-145724-0027 AND AGAIN SHE LED HIM TO THE BALL ROOM THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WAS DELIGHTED TO SEE HIM SAFE AND SOUND AND WHEN THEY WERE DANCING TOGETHER SHE WHISPERED IN HIS EAR IF YOU SUCCEED AGAIN TO MORROW WAIT FOR ME WITH THE FOAL IN THE MEADOW
1898-145724-0028 AFTER THE BALL WE WILL FLY AWAY TOGETHER ON THE THIRD DAY THE PRINCE LED THE MARE TO THE MEADOW AGAIN BUT ONCE MORE SHE VANISHED BEFORE HIS EYES THEN THE PRINCE TOOK OUT HIS LITTLE BELL AND RANG IT THREE TIMES
1898-145724-0029 IN A MOMENT THE KING OF THE FISHES APPEARED AND SAID TO HIM I KNOW QUITE WELL WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO AND I WILL SUMMON ALL THE FISHES OF THE SEA TOGETHER
1898-145724-0030 SHE SAID TO HIM YOU ARE A BRAVE YOUTH AND I WILL MAKE YOU MY BODY SERVANT BUT WHAT SHALL I GIVE YOU AS A REWARD TO BEGIN WITH
1898-145724-0031 THE PRINCE BEGGED FOR A FOAL OF THE MARE WHICH THE MOTHER DRAGON AT ONCE GAVE HIM AND OVER AND ABOVE A CLOAK MADE OF GOLD FOR SHE HAD FALLEN IN LOVE WITH HIM BECAUSE HE HAD PRAISED HER BEAUTY SO IN THE EVENING HE APPEARED AT THE BALL IN HIS GOLDEN CLOAK
1898-145724-0032 THE PRINCE AND SHE FLEW LIKE THE WIND TILL THEY REACHED THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DWELLING BUT THE DRAGONS HAD NOTICED THEIR FLIGHT AND WOKE THEIR BROTHER OUT OF HIS YEAR'S SLEEP HE FLEW INTO A TERRIBLE RAGE WHEN HE HEARD WHAT HAD HAPPENED
1898-145724-0033 AND DETERMINED TO LAY SIEGE TO THE FLOWER QUEEN'S PALACE BUT THE QUEEN CAUSED A FOREST OF FLOWERS AS HIGH AS THE SKY TO GROW UP ROUND HER DWELLING THROUGH WHICH NO ONE COULD FORCE A WAY
1898-145724-0034 WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN HEARD THAT HER DAUGHTER WANTED TO MARRY THE PRINCE SHE SAID TO HIM I WILL GIVE MY CONSENT TO YOUR MARRIAGE GLADLY BUT MY DAUGHTER CAN ONLY STAY WITH YOU IN SUMMER IN WINTER WHEN EVERYTHING IS DEAD AND THE GROUND COVERED WITH SNOW
1898-145724-0035 SHE MUST COME AND LIVE WITH ME IN MY PALACE UNDERGROUND THE PRINCE CONSENTED TO THIS AND LED HIS BEAUTIFUL BRIDE HOME WHERE THE WEDDING WAS HELD WITH GREAT POMP AND MAGNIFICENCE THE YOUNG COUPLE LIVED HAPPILY TOGETHER TILL WINTER CAME
1898-145724-0036 WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER DEPARTED AND WENT HOME TO HER MOTHER
1898-145724-0037 AND LASTED TILL THE APPROACH OF WINTER WHEN THE FLOWER QUEEN'S DAUGHTER WENT BACK AGAIN TO HER MOTHER
19-198-0000 NORTHANGER ABBEY
19-198-0001 THIS LITTLE WORK WAS FINISHED IN THE YEAR EIGHTEEN O THREE AND INTENDED FOR IMMEDIATE PUBLICATION IT WAS DISPOSED OF TO A BOOKSELLER IT WAS EVEN ADVERTISED
19-198-0002 NEITHER THE AUTHOR NOR THE PUBLIC HAVE ANY OTHER CONCERN THAN AS SOME OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY UPON THOSE PARTS OF THE WORK WHICH THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE MADE COMPARATIVELY OBSOLETE
19-198-0003 THE PUBLIC ARE ENTREATED TO BEAR IN MIND THAT THIRTEEN YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE IT WAS FINISHED MANY MORE SINCE IT WAS BEGUN AND THAT DURING THAT PERIOD PLACES MANNERS BOOKS AND OPINIONS HAVE UNDERGONE CONSIDERABLE CHANGES
19-198-0004 CHAPTER ONE NO ONE WHO HAD EVER SEEN CATHERINE MORLAND IN HER INFANCY WOULD HAVE SUPPOSED HER BORN TO BE AN HEROINE HER SITUATION IN LIFE
19-198-0005 THE CHARACTER OF HER FATHER AND MOTHER HER OWN PERSON AND DISPOSITION WERE ALL EQUALLY AGAINST HER HER FATHER WAS A CLERGYMAN WITHOUT BEING NEGLECTED OR POOR AND A VERY RESPECTABLE MAN
19-198-0006 HER MOTHER WAS A WOMAN OF USEFUL PLAIN SENSE WITH A GOOD TEMPER AND WHAT IS MORE REMARKABLE WITH A GOOD CONSTITUTION SHE HAD THREE SONS BEFORE CATHERINE WAS BORN
19-198-0007 WHERE THERE ARE HEADS AND ARMS AND LEGS ENOUGH FOR THE NUMBER BUT THE MORLANDS HAD LITTLE OTHER RIGHT TO THE WORD FOR THEY WERE IN GENERAL VERY PLAIN AND CATHERINE FOR MANY YEARS OF HER LIFE AS PLAIN AS ANY
19-198-0008 SHE HAD A THIN AWKWARD FIGURE
19-198-0009 DARK LANK HAIR AND STRONG FEATURES SO MUCH FOR HER PERSON AND NOT LESS UNPROPITIOUS FOR HEROISM SEEMED HER MIND SHE WAS FOND OF ALL BOY'S PLAYS AND GREATLY PREFERRED CRICKET
19-198-0010 NOT MERELY TO DOLLS BUT TO THE MORE HEROIC ENJOYMENTS OF INFANCY NURSING A DORMOUSE FEEDING A CANARY BIRD OR WATERING A ROSE BUSH INDEED SHE HAD NO TASTE FOR A GARDEN
19-198-0011 AND IF SHE GATHERED FLOWERS AT ALL IT WAS CHIEFLY FOR THE PLEASURE OF MISCHIEF AT LEAST SO IT WAS CONJECTURED FROM HER ALWAYS PREFERRING THOSE WHICH SHE WAS FORBIDDEN TO TAKE SUCH WERE HER PROPENSITIES
19-198-0012 HER ABILITIES WERE QUITE AS EXTRAORDINARY SHE NEVER COULD LEARN OR UNDERSTAND ANYTHING BEFORE SHE WAS TAUGHT AND SOMETIMES NOT EVEN THEN FOR SHE WAS OFTEN INATTENTIVE AND OCCASIONALLY STUPID
19-198-0013 HER MOTHER WAS THREE MONTHS IN TEACHING HER ONLY TO REPEAT THE BEGGAR'S PETITION AND AFTER ALL HER NEXT SISTER SALLY COULD SAY IT BETTER THAN SHE DID NOT THAT CATHERINE WAS ALWAYS STUPID BY NO MEANS
19-198-0014 SHE LEARNT THE FABLE OF THE HARE AND MANY FRIENDS AS QUICKLY AS ANY GIRL IN ENGLAND HER MOTHER WISHED HER TO LEARN MUSIC AND CATHERINE WAS SURE SHE SHOULD LIKE IT FOR SHE WAS VERY FOND OF TINKLING THE KEYS OF THE OLD FORLORN SPINNET
19-198-0015 SO AT EIGHT YEARS OLD SHE BEGAN SHE LEARNT A YEAR AND COULD NOT BEAR IT AND MISSUS MORLAND WHO DID NOT INSIST ON HER DAUGHTERS BEING ACCOMPLISHED IN SPITE OF INCAPACITY OR DISTASTE ALLOWED HER TO LEAVE OFF
19-198-0016 FRENCH BY HER MOTHER HER PROFICIENCY IN EITHER WAS NOT REMARKABLE AND SHE SHIRKED HER LESSONS IN BOTH WHENEVER SHE COULD WHAT A STRANGE UNACCOUNTABLE CHARACTER FOR WITH ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OF PROFLIGACY AT TEN YEARS OLD
19-198-0017 HATED CONFINEMENT AND CLEANLINESS AND LOVED NOTHING SO WELL IN THE WORLD AS ROLLING DOWN THE GREEN SLOPE AT THE BACK OF THE HOUSE SUCH WAS CATHERINE MORLAND AT TEN AT FIFTEEN APPEARANCES WERE MENDING
19-198-0018 SHE BEGAN TO CURL HER HAIR AND LONG FOR BALLS HER COMPLEXION IMPROVED HER FEATURES WERE SOFTENED BY PLUMPNESS AND COLOUR HER EYES GAINED MORE ANIMATION AND HER FIGURE MORE CONSEQUENCE
19-198-0019 HER LOVE OF DIRT GAVE WAY TO AN INCLINATION FOR FINERY AND SHE GREW CLEAN AS SHE GREW SMART SHE HAD NOW THE PLEASURE OF SOMETIMES HEARING HER FATHER AND MOTHER REMARK ON HER PERSONAL IMPROVEMENT
19-198-0020 CATHERINE GROWS QUITE A GOOD LOOKING GIRL SHE IS ALMOST PRETTY TODAY WERE WORDS WHICH CAUGHT HER EARS NOW AND THEN AND HOW WELCOME WERE THE SOUNDS TO LOOK ALMOST PRETTY
19-198-0021 THAN A BEAUTY FROM HER CRADLE CAN EVER RECEIVE MISSUS MORLAND WAS A VERY GOOD WOMAN AND WISHED TO SEE HER CHILDREN EVERYTHING THEY OUGHT TO BE BUT HER TIME WAS SO MUCH OCCUPIED IN LYING IN AND TEACHING THE LITTLE ONES
19-198-0022 THAT HER ELDER DAUGHTERS WERE INEVITABLY LEFT TO SHIFT FOR THEMSELVES AND IT WAS NOT VERY WONDERFUL THAT CATHERINE WHO HAD BY NATURE NOTHING HEROIC ABOUT HER SHOULD PREFER CRICKET BASEBALL RIDING ON HORSEBACK
19-198-0023 AND RUNNING ABOUT THE COUNTRY AT THE AGE OF FOURTEEN TO BOOKS OR AT LEAST BOOKS OF INFORMATION FOR PROVIDED THAT NOTHING LIKE USEFUL KNOWLEDGE COULD BE GAINED FROM THEM PROVIDED THEY WERE ALL STORY AND NO REFLECTION
19-198-0024 SHE HAD NEVER ANY OBJECTION TO BOOKS AT ALL BUT FROM FIFTEEN TO SEVENTEEN SHE WAS IN TRAINING FOR A HEROINE SHE READ ALL SUCH WORKS AS HEROINES MUST READ TO SUPPLY THEIR MEMORIES WITH THOSE QUOTATIONS WHICH ARE SO SERVICEABLE
19-198-0025 MANY A FLOWER IS BORN TO BLUSH UNSEEN AND WASTE ITS FRAGRANCE ON THE DESERT AIR FROM THOMPSON THAT IT IS A DELIGHTFUL TASK TO TEACH THE YOUNG IDEA HOW TO SHOOT
19-198-0026 AND FROM SHAKESPEARE SHE GAINED A GREAT STORE OF INFORMATION AMONGST THE REST THAT TRIFLES LIGHT AS AIR ARE TO THE JEALOUS CONFIRMATION STRONG AS PROOFS OF HOLY WRIT
19-198-0027 THAT THE POOR BEETLE WHICH WE TREAD UPON IN CORPORAL SUFFERANCE FEELS A PANG AS GREAT AS WHEN A GIANT DIES AND THAT A YOUNG WOMAN IN LOVE ALWAYS LOOKS
19-198-0028 LIKE PATIENCE ON A MONUMENT SMILING AT GRIEF SO FAR HER IMPROVEMENT WAS SUFFICIENT AND IN MANY OTHER POINTS SHE CAME ON EXCEEDINGLY WELL FOR THOUGH SHE COULD NOT WRITE SONNETS
19-198-0029 SHE BROUGHT HERSELF TO READ THEM AND THOUGH THERE SEEMED NO CHANCE OF HER THROWING A WHOLE PARTY INTO RAPTURES BY A PRELUDE ON THE PIANOFORTE OF HER OWN COMPOSITION SHE COULD LISTEN TO OTHER PEOPLE'S PERFORMANCE WITH VERY LITTLE FATIGUE
19-198-0030 HER GREATEST DEFICIENCY WAS IN THE PENCIL SHE HAD NO NOTION OF DRAWING NOT ENOUGH EVEN TO ATTEMPT A SKETCH OF HER LOVER'S PROFILE THAT SHE MIGHT BE DETECTED IN THE DESIGN
19-198-0031 THERE SHE FELL MISERABLY SHORT OF THE TRUE HEROIC HEIGHT AT PRESENT SHE DID NOT KNOW HER OWN POVERTY FOR SHE HAD NO LOVER TO PORTRAY SHE HAD REACHED THE AGE OF SEVENTEEN
19-198-0032 WITHOUT HAVING SEEN ONE AMIABLE YOUTH WHO COULD CALL FORTH HER SENSIBILITY WITHOUT HAVING INSPIRED ONE REAL PASSION AND WITHOUT HAVING EXCITED EVEN ANY ADMIRATION BUT WHAT WAS VERY MODERATE AND VERY TRANSIENT
19-198-0033 THIS WAS STRANGE INDEED BUT STRANGE THINGS MAY BE GENERALLY ACCOUNTED FOR IF THEIR CAUSE BE FAIRLY SEARCHED OUT THERE WAS NOT ONE LORD IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD NO NOT EVEN A BARONET
19-198-0034 THERE WAS NOT ONE FAMILY AMONG THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD REARED AND SUPPORTED A BOY ACCIDENTALLY FOUND AT THEIR DOOR NOT ONE YOUNG MAN WHOSE ORIGIN WAS UNKNOWN HER FATHER HAD NO WARD AND THE SQUIRE OF THE PARISH NO CHILDREN
19-198-0035 BUT WHEN A YOUNG LADY IS TO BE A HEROINE THE PERVERSENESS OF FORTY SURROUNDING FAMILIES CANNOT PREVENT HER SOMETHING MUST AND WILL HAPPEN TO THROW A HERO IN HER WAY MISTER ALLEN
19-198-0036 WHO OWNED THE CHIEF OF THE PROPERTY ABOUT FULLERTON THE VILLAGE IN WILTSHIRE WHERE THE MORLANDS LIVED WAS ORDERED TO BATH FOR THE BENEFIT OF A GOUTY CONSTITUTION AND HIS LADY A GOOD HUMOURED WOMAN FOND OF MISS MORLAND AND PROBABLY AWARE THAT IF
19-198-0037 SHE MUST SEEK THEM ABROAD INVITED HER TO GO WITH THEM
19-227-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY CATHERINE'S DISPOSITION WAS NOT NATURALLY SEDENTARY NOR HAD HER HABITS BEEN EVER VERY INDUSTRIOUS BUT WHATEVER MIGHT HITHERTO HAVE BEEN HER DEFECTS OF THAT SORT
19-227-0001 HER MOTHER COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THEM NOW TO BE GREATLY INCREASED SHE COULD NEITHER SIT STILL NOR EMPLOY HERSELF FOR TEN MINUTES TOGETHER WALKING ROUND THE GARDEN AND ORCHARD AGAIN AND AGAIN AS IF NOTHING BUT MOTION WAS VOLUNTARY
19-227-0002 AND IT SEEMED AS IF SHE COULD EVEN WALK ABOUT THE HOUSE RATHER THAN REMAIN FIXED FOR ANY TIME IN THE PARLOUR HER LOSS OF SPIRITS WAS A YET GREATER ALTERATION IN HER RAMBLING AND HER IDLENESS
19-227-0003 BUT WHEN A THIRD NIGHT'S REST HAD NEITHER RESTORED HER CHEERFULNESS IMPROVED HER IN USEFUL ACTIVITY NOR GIVEN HER A GREATER INCLINATION FOR NEEDLEWORK SHE COULD NO LONGER REFRAIN FROM THE GENTLE REPROOF OF
19-227-0004 MY DEAR CATHERINE I AM AFRAID YOU ARE GROWING QUITE A FINE LADY I DO NOT KNOW WHEN POOR RICHARD'S CRAVATS WOULD BE DONE IF HE HAD NO FRIEND BUT YOU YOUR HEAD RUNS TOO MUCH UPON BATH
19-227-0005 CATHERINE TOOK UP HER WORK DIRECTLY SAYING IN A DEJECTED VOICE THAT HER HEAD DID NOT RUN UPON BATH MUCH THEN YOU ARE FRETTING ABOUT GENERAL TILNEY AND THAT IS VERY SIMPLE OF YOU
19-227-0006 FOR TEN TO ONE WHETHER YOU EVER SEE HIM AGAIN YOU SHOULD NEVER FRET ABOUT TRIFLES AFTER A SHORT SILENCE I HOPE MY CATHERINE YOU ARE NOT GETTING OUT OF HUMOUR WITH HOME BECAUSE IT IS NOT SO GRAND AS NORTHANGER
19-227-0007 THAT WOULD BE TURNING YOUR VISIT INTO AN EVIL INDEED WHEREVER YOU ARE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS BE CONTENTED BUT ESPECIALLY AT HOME BECAUSE THERE YOU MUST SPEND THE MOST OF YOUR TIME I DID NOT QUITE LIKE AT BREAKFAST
19-227-0008 TO HEAR YOU TALK SO MUCH ABOUT THE FRENCH BREAD AT NORTHANGER I AM SURE I DO NOT CARE ABOUT THE BREAD IT IS ALL THE SAME TO ME WHAT I EAT THERE IS A VERY CLEVER ESSAY IN ONE OF THE BOOKS UPSTAIRS UPON MUCH SUCH A SUBJECT
19-227-0009 ABOUT YOUNG GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN SPOILT FOR HOME BY GREAT ACQUAINTANCE THE MIRROR I THINK I WILL LOOK IT OUT FOR YOU SOME DAY OR OTHER BECAUSE I AM SURE IT WILL DO YOU GOOD CATHERINE SAID NO MORE AND WITH AN ENDEAVOUR TO DO RIGHT
19-227-0010 APPLIED TO HER WORK BUT AFTER A FEW MINUTES SUNK AGAIN WITHOUT KNOWING IT HERSELF INTO LANGUOR AND LISTLESSNESS MOVING HERSELF IN HER CHAIR FROM THE IRRITATION OF WEARINESS MUCH OFTENER THAN SHE MOVED HER NEEDLE
19-227-0011 HASTILY LEFT THE ROOM TO FETCH THE BOOK IN QUESTION ANXIOUS TO LOSE NO TIME IN ATTACKING SO DREADFUL A MALADY IT WAS SOME TIME BEFORE SHE COULD FIND WHAT SHE LOOKED FOR AND OTHER FAMILY MATTERS OCCURRING TO DETAIN HER
19-227-0012 A QUARTER OF AN HOUR HAD ELAPSED ERE SHE RETURNED DOWNSTAIRS WITH THE VOLUME FROM WHICH SO MUCH WAS HOPED HER AVOCATIONS ABOVE HAVING SHUT OUT ALL NOISE BUT WHAT SHE CREATED HERSELF
19-227-0013 SHE KNEW NOT THAT A VISITOR HAD ARRIVED WITHIN THE LAST FEW MINUTES TILL ON ENTERING THE ROOM THE FIRST OBJECT SHE BEHELD WAS A YOUNG MAN WHOM SHE HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE
19-227-0014 WITH A LOOK OF MUCH RESPECT HE IMMEDIATELY ROSE AND BEING INTRODUCED TO HER BY HER CONSCIOUS DAUGHTER AS MISTER HENRY TILNEY WITH THE EMBARRASSMENT OF REAL SENSIBILITY
19-227-0015 BEGAN TO APOLOGIZE FOR HIS APPEARANCE THERE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT AFTER WHAT HAD PASSED HE HAD LITTLE RIGHT TO EXPECT A WELCOME AT FULLERTON AND STATING HIS IMPATIENCE TO BE ASSURED OF MISS MORLAND'S HAVING REACHED HER HOME IN SAFETY
19-227-0016 AS THE CAUSE OF HIS INTRUSION HE DID NOT ADDRESS HIMSELF TO AN UNCANDID JUDGE OR A RESENTFUL HEART FAR FROM COMPREHENDING HIM OR HIS SISTER IN THEIR FATHER'S MISCONDUCT
19-227-0017 MISSUS MORLAND HAD BEEN ALWAYS KINDLY DISPOSED TOWARDS EACH AND INSTANTLY PLEASED BY HIS APPEARANCE RECEIVED HIM WITH THE SIMPLE PROFESSIONS OF UNAFFECTED BENEVOLENCE THANKING HIM FOR SUCH AN ATTENTION TO HER DAUGHTER
19-227-0018 THOUGH HIS HEART WAS GREATLY RELIEVED BY SUCH UNLOOKED FOR MILDNESS IT WAS NOT JUST AT THAT MOMENT IN HIS POWER TO SAY ANYTHING TO THE PURPOSE RETURNING IN SILENCE TO HIS SEAT THEREFORE
19-227-0019 BUT HER GLOWING CHEEK AND BRIGHTENED EYE MADE HER MOTHER TRUST THAT THIS GOOD NATURED VISIT WOULD AT LEAST SET HER HEART AT EASE FOR A TIME AND GLADLY THEREFORE DID SHE LAY ASIDE THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE MIRROR FOR A FUTURE HOUR
19-227-0020 DESIROUS OF MISTER MORLAND'S ASSISTANCE AS WELL IN GIVING ENCOURAGEMENT AS IN FINDING CONVERSATION FOR HER GUEST WHOSE EMBARRASSMENT ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT SHE EARNESTLY PITIED
19-227-0021 MISSUS MORLAND HAD VERY EARLY DISPATCHED ONE OF THE CHILDREN TO SUMMON HIM BUT MISTER MORLAND WAS FROM HOME AND BEING THUS WITHOUT ANY SUPPORT AT THE END OF A QUARTER OF AN HOUR SHE HAD NOTHING TO SAY
19-227-0022 AFTER A COUPLE OF MINUTES UNBROKEN SILENCE HENRY TURNING TO CATHERINE FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE HER MOTHER'S ENTRANCE ASKED HER WITH SUDDEN ALACRITY IF MISTER AND MISSUS ALLEN WERE NOW AT FULLERTON
19-227-0023 AND ON DEVELOPING FROM AMIDST ALL HER PERPLEXITY OF WORDS IN REPLY THE MEANING WHICH ONE SHORT SYLLABLE WOULD HAVE GIVEN IMMEDIATELY EXPRESSED HIS INTENTION OF PAYING HIS RESPECTS TO THEM AND
19-227-0024 ASKED HER IF SHE WOULD HAVE THE GOODNESS TO SHOW HIM THE WAY YOU MAY SEE THE HOUSE FROM THIS WINDOW SIR WAS INFORMATION ON SARAH'S SIDE WHICH PRODUCED ONLY A BOW OF ACKNOWLEDGMENT FROM THE GENTLEMAN AND A SILENCING NOD FROM HER MOTHER
19-227-0025 FOR MISSUS MORLAND THINKING IT PROBABLE AS A SECONDARY CONSIDERATION IN HIS WISH OF WAITING ON THEIR WORTHY NEIGHBOURS THAT HE MIGHT HAVE SOME EXPLANATION TO GIVE OF HIS FATHER'S BEHAVIOUR
19-227-0026 WHICH IT MUST BE MORE PLEASANT FOR HIM TO COMMUNICATE ONLY TO CATHERINE WOULD NOT ON ANY ACCOUNT PREVENT HER ACCOMPANYING HIM THEY BEGAN THEIR WALK AND MISSUS MORLAND WAS NOT ENTIRELY MISTAKEN IN HIS OBJECT IN WISHING IT
19-227-0027 SOME EXPLANATION ON HIS FATHER'S ACCOUNT HE HAD TO GIVE BUT HIS FIRST PURPOSE WAS TO EXPLAIN HIMSELF AND BEFORE THEY REACHED MISTER ALLEN'S GROUNDS HE HAD DONE IT SO WELL THAT CATHERINE DID NOT THINK IT COULD EVER BE REPEATED TOO OFTEN
19-227-0028 AND DELIGHTED IN ALL THE EXCELLENCIES OF HER CHARACTER AND TRULY LOVED HER SOCIETY I MUST CONFESS THAT HIS AFFECTION ORIGINATED IN NOTHING BETTER THAN GRATITUDE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT A PERSUASION OF HER PARTIALITY FOR HIM
19-227-0029 HAD BEEN THE ONLY CAUSE OF GIVING HER A SERIOUS THOUGHT IT IS A NEW CIRCUMSTANCE IN ROMANCE I ACKNOWLEDGE AND DREADFULLY DEROGATORY OF AN HEROINE'S DIGNITY BUT IF IT BE AS NEW IN COMMON LIFE
19-227-0030 THE CREDIT OF A WILD IMAGINATION WILL AT LEAST BE ALL MY OWN A VERY SHORT VISIT TO MISSUS ALLEN IN WHICH HENRY TALKED AT RANDOM WITHOUT SENSE OR CONNECTION AND CATHERINE
19-227-0031 SCARCELY OPENED HER LIPS DISMISSED THEM TO THE ECSTASIES OF ANOTHER TETE A TETE AND BEFORE IT WAS SUFFERED TO CLOSE SHE WAS ENABLED TO JUDGE HOW FAR HE WAS SANCTIONED BY PARENTAL AUTHORITY IN HIS PRESENT APPLICATION
19-227-0032 ON HIS RETURN FROM WOODSTON TWO DAYS BEFORE HE HAD BEEN MET NEAR THE ABBEY BY HIS IMPATIENT FATHER HASTILY INFORMED IN ANGRY TERMS OF MISS MORLAND'S DEPARTURE AND ORDERED TO THINK OF HER NO MORE
19-227-0033 SUCH WAS THE PERMISSION UPON WHICH HE HAD NOW OFFERED HER HIS HAND THE AFFRIGHTED CATHERINE AMIDST ALL THE TERRORS OF EXPECTATION AS SHE LISTENED TO THIS ACCOUNT
19-227-0034 COULD NOT BUT REJOICE IN THE KIND CAUTION WITH WHICH HENRY HAD SAVED HER FROM THE NECESSITY OF A CONSCIENTIOUS REJECTION BY ENGAGING HER FAITH BEFORE HE MENTIONED THE SUBJECT
19-227-0035 NOTHING TO LAY TO HER CHARGE BUT HER BEING THE INVOLUNTARY UNCONSCIOUS OBJECT OF A DECEPTION WHICH HIS PRIDE COULD NOT PARDON AND WHICH A BETTER PRIDE WOULD HAVE BEEN ASHAMED TO OWN
19-227-0036 AND DESIGNED HER FOR HIS DAUGHTER IN LAW ON DISCOVERING HIS ERROR TO TURN HER FROM THE HOUSE SEEMED THE BEST THOUGH TO HIS FEELINGS AN INADEQUATE PROOF OF HIS RESENTMENT TOWARDS HERSELF AND HIS CONTEMPT OF HER FAMILY
19-227-0037 JOHN THORPE HAD FIRST MISLED HIM THE GENERAL PERCEIVING HIS SON ONE NIGHT AT THE THEATRE TO BE PAYING CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0038 HAD ACCIDENTALLY INQUIRED OF THORPE IF HE KNEW MORE OF HER THAN HER NAME THORPE MOST HAPPY TO BE ON SPEAKING TERMS WITH A MAN OF GENERAL TILNEY'S IMPORTANCE HAD BEEN JOYFULLY AND PROUDLY COMMUNICATIVE
19-227-0039 AND BEING AT THAT TIME NOT ONLY IN DAILY EXPECTATION OF MORLAND'S ENGAGING ISABELLA BUT LIKEWISE PRETTY WELL RESOLVED UPON MARRYING CATHERINE HIMSELF
19-227-0040 HIS VANITY INDUCED HIM TO REPRESENT THE FAMILY AS YET MORE WEALTHY THAN HIS VANITY AND AVARICE HAD MADE HIM BELIEVE THEM WITH WHOMSOEVER HE WAS OR WAS LIKELY TO BE CONNECTED
19-227-0041 HIS OWN CONSEQUENCE ALWAYS REQUIRED THAT THEIRS SHOULD BE GREAT AND AS HIS INTIMACY WITH ANY ACQUAINTANCE GREW SO REGULARLY GREW THEIR FORTUNE THE EXPECTATIONS OF HIS FRIEND MORLAND THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST OVERRATED
19-227-0042 HAD EVER SINCE HIS INTRODUCTION TO ISABELLA BEEN GRADUALLY INCREASING AND BY MERELY ADDING TWICE AS MUCH FOR THE GRANDEUR OF THE MOMENT BY DOUBLING WHAT HE CHOSE TO THINK THE AMOUNT OF MISTER MORLAND'S PREFERMENT TREBLING HIS PRIVATE FORTUNE
19-227-0043 BESTOWING A RICH AUNT AND SINKING HALF THE CHILDREN HE WAS ABLE TO REPRESENT THE WHOLE FAMILY TO THE GENERAL IN A MOST RESPECTABLE LIGHT FOR CATHERINE HOWEVER THE PECULIAR OBJECT OF THE GENERAL'S CURIOSITY
19-227-0044 AND HIS OWN SPECULATIONS HE HAD YET SOMETHING MORE IN RESERVE AND THE TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND POUNDS WHICH HER FATHER COULD GIVE HER WOULD BE A PRETTY ADDITION TO MISTER ALLEN'S ESTATE
19-227-0045 HER INTIMACY THERE HAD MADE HIM SERIOUSLY DETERMINE ON HER BEING HANDSOMELY LEGACIED HEREAFTER AND TO SPEAK OF HER THEREFORE AS THE ALMOST ACKNOWLEDGED FUTURE HEIRESS OF FULLERTON NATURALLY FOLLOWED
19-227-0046 UPON SUCH INTELLIGENCE THE GENERAL HAD PROCEEDED FOR NEVER HAD IT OCCURRED TO HIM TO DOUBT ITS AUTHORITY THORPE'S INTEREST IN THE FAMILY BY HIS SISTER'S APPROACHING CONNECTION WITH ONE OF ITS MEMBERS
19-227-0047 AND HIS OWN VIEWS ON ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH HE BOASTED WITH ALMOST EQUAL OPENNESS SEEMED SUFFICIENT VOUCHERS FOR HIS TRUTH AND TO THESE WERE ADDED THE ABSOLUTE FACTS OF THE ALLENS BEING WEALTHY AND CHILDLESS
19-227-0048 OF MISS MORLAND'S BEING UNDER THEIR CARE AND AS SOON AS HIS ACQUAINTANCE ALLOWED HIM TO JUDGE OF THEIR TREATING HER WITH PARENTAL KINDNESS HIS RESOLUTION WAS SOON FORMED
19-227-0049 AND THANKFUL FOR MISTER THORPE'S COMMUNICATION HE ALMOST INSTANTLY DETERMINED TO SPARE NO PAINS IN WEAKENING HIS BOASTED INTEREST AND RUINING HIS DEAREST HOPES
19-227-0050 CATHERINE HERSELF COULD NOT BE MORE IGNORANT AT THE TIME OF ALL THIS THAN HIS OWN CHILDREN HENRY AND ELEANOR PERCEIVING NOTHING IN HER SITUATION LIKELY TO ENGAGE THEIR FATHER'S PARTICULAR RESPECT
19-227-0051 HAD SEEN WITH ASTONISHMENT THE SUDDENNESS CONTINUANCE AND EXTENT OF HIS ATTENTION AND THOUGH LATTERLY FROM SOME HINTS WHICH HAD ACCOMPANIED AN ALMOST POSITIVE COMMAND TO HIS SON OF DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO ATTACH HER
19-227-0052 HENRY WAS CONVINCED OF HIS FATHER'S BELIEVING IT TO BE AN ADVANTAGEOUS CONNECTION IT WAS NOT TILL THE LATE EXPLANATION AT NORTHANGER THAT THEY HAD THE SMALLEST IDEA OF THE FALSE CALCULATIONS WHICH HAD HURRIED HIM ON
19-227-0053 THAT THEY WERE FALSE THE GENERAL HAD LEARNT FROM THE VERY PERSON WHO HAD SUGGESTED THEM FROM THORPE HIMSELF WHOM HE HAD CHANCED TO MEET AGAIN IN TOWN AND WHO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF EXACTLY OPPOSITE FEELINGS
19-227-0054 IRRITATED BY CATHERINE'S REFUSAL AND YET MORE BY THE FAILURE OF A VERY RECENT ENDEAVOUR TO ACCOMPLISH A RECONCILIATION BETWEEN MORLAND AND ISABELLA CONVINCED THAT THEY WERE SEPARATED FOREVER
19-227-0055 AND SPURNING A FRIENDSHIP WHICH COULD BE NO LONGER SERVICEABLE HASTENED TO CONTRADICT ALL THAT HE HAD SAID BEFORE TO THE ADVANTAGE OF THE MORLANDS CONFESSED HIMSELF TO HAVE BEEN TOTALLY MISTAKEN IN HIS OPINION OF THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND CHARACTER
19-227-0056 MISLED BY THE RHODOMONTADE OF HIS FRIEND TO BELIEVE HIS FATHER A MAN OF SUBSTANCE AND CREDIT WHEREAS THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE TWO OR THREE LAST WEEKS PROVED HIM TO BE NEITHER
19-227-0057 FOR AFTER COMING EAGERLY FORWARD ON THE FIRST OVERTURE OF A MARRIAGE BETWEEN THE FAMILIES WITH THE MOST LIBERAL PROPOSALS HE HAD ON BEING BROUGHT TO THE POINT BY THE SHREWDNESS OF THE RELATOR
19-227-0058 BEEN CONSTRAINED TO ACKNOWLEDGE HIMSELF INCAPABLE OF GIVING THE YOUNG PEOPLE EVEN A DECENT SUPPORT THEY WERE IN FACT A NECESSITOUS FAMILY NUMEROUS TOO ALMOST BEYOND EXAMPLE BY NO MEANS RESPECTED IN THEIR OWN NEIGHBOURHOOD
19-227-0059 AS HE HAD LATELY HAD PARTICULAR OPPORTUNITIES OF DISCOVERING AIMING AT A STYLE OF LIFE WHICH THEIR FORTUNE COULD NOT WARRANT SEEKING TO BETTER THEMSELVES BY WEALTHY CONNECTIONS A FORWARD BRAGGING SCHEMING RACE
19-227-0060 THE TERRIFIED GENERAL PRONOUNCED THE NAME OF ALLEN WITH AN INQUIRING LOOK AND HERE TOO THORPE HAD LEARNT HIS ERROR THE ALLENS HE BELIEVED HAD LIVED NEAR THEM TOO LONG
19-227-0061 AND HE KNEW THE YOUNG MAN ON WHOM THE FULLERTON ESTATE MUST DEVOLVE THE GENERAL NEEDED NO MORE ENRAGED WITH ALMOST EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD BUT HIMSELF HE SET OUT THE NEXT DAY FOR THE ABBEY WHERE HIS PERFORMANCES HAVE BEEN SEEN
19-227-0062 I LEAVE IT TO MY READER'S SAGACITY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF ALL THIS IT WAS POSSIBLE FOR HENRY TO COMMUNICATE AT THIS TIME TO CATHERINE HOW MUCH OF IT HE COULD HAVE LEARNT FROM HIS FATHER
19-227-0063 IN WHAT POINTS HIS OWN CONJECTURES MIGHT ASSIST HIM AND WHAT PORTION MUST YET REMAIN TO BE TOLD IN A LETTER FROM JAMES
19-227-0064 CATHERINE AT ANY RATE HEARD ENOUGH TO FEEL THAT IN SUSPECTING GENERAL TILNEY OF EITHER MURDERING OR SHUTTING UP HIS WIFE SHE HAD SCARCELY SINNED AGAINST HIS CHARACTER OR MAGNIFIED HIS CRUELTY
19-227-0065 HENRY IN HAVING SUCH THINGS TO RELATE OF HIS FATHER WAS ALMOST AS PITIABLE AS IN THEIR FIRST AVOWAL TO HIMSELF HE BLUSHED FOR THE NARROW MINDED COUNSEL WHICH HE WAS OBLIGED TO EXPOSE
19-227-0066 THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN THEM AT NORTHANGER HAD BEEN OF THE MOST UNFRIENDLY KIND HENRY'S INDIGNATION ON HEARING HOW CATHERINE HAD BEEN TREATED ON COMPREHENDING HIS FATHER'S VIEWS AND BEING ORDERED TO ACQUIESCE IN THEM
19-227-0067 HAD BEEN OPEN AND BOLD THE GENERAL ACCUSTOMED ON EVERY ORDINARY OCCASION TO GIVE THE LAW IN HIS FAMILY PREPARED FOR NO RELUCTANCE BUT OF FEELING
19-227-0068 NO OPPOSING DESIRE THAT SHOULD DARE TO CLOTHE ITSELF IN WORDS COULD ILL BROOK THE OPPOSITION OF HIS SON STEADY AS THE SANCTION OF REASON AND THE DICTATE OF CONSCIENCE COULD MAKE IT BUT IN SUCH A CAUSE HIS ANGER
19-227-0069 THOUGH IT MUST SHOCK COULD NOT INTIMIDATE HENRY WHO WAS SUSTAINED IN HIS PURPOSE BY A CONVICTION OF ITS JUSTICE HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND AS MUCH IN HONOUR AS IN AFFECTION TO MISS MORLAND
19-227-0070 AND BELIEVING THAT HEART TO BE HIS OWN WHICH HE HAD BEEN DIRECTED TO GAIN NO UNWORTHY RETRACTION OF A TACIT CONSENT
19-227-0071 HE STEADILY REFUSED TO ACCOMPANY HIS FATHER INTO HEREFORDSHIRE AN ENGAGEMENT FORMED ALMOST AT THE MOMENT TO PROMOTE THE DISMISSAL OF CATHERINE AND AS STEADILY DECLARED HIS INTENTION OF OFFERING HER HIS HAND
19-227-0072 THE GENERAL WAS FURIOUS IN HIS ANGER AND THEY PARTED IN DREADFUL DISAGREEMENT HENRY IN AN AGITATION OF MIND WHICH MANY SOLITARY HOURS WERE REQUIRED TO COMPOSE
1926-143879-0000 CHAPTER THIRTY ONE ISABEL CAME BACK TO FLORENCE BUT ONLY AFTER SEVERAL MONTHS AN INTERVAL SUFFICIENTLY REPLETE WITH INCIDENT IT IS NOT HOWEVER DURING THIS INTERVAL THAT WE ARE CLOSELY CONCERNED WITH HER
1926-143879-0001 OUR ATTENTION IS ENGAGED AGAIN ON A CERTAIN DAY IN THE LATE SPRING TIME SHORTLY AFTER HER RETURN TO PALAZZO CRESCENTINI
1926-143879-0002 TO SOCIAL USES AND THERE WAS THAT IN HER EXPRESSION AND ATTITUDE
1926-143879-0003 THE TALL WINDOW WAS OPEN AND THOUGH ITS GREEN SHUTTERS WERE PARTLY DRAWN THE BRIGHT AIR OF THE GARDEN HAD COME IN THROUGH A BROAD INTERSTICE AND FILLED THE ROOM WITH WARMTH
1926-143879-0004 TOO TROUBLED FOR ATTENTION SHE MOVED IN A VAIN CIRCLE
1926-143879-0005 SINCE THE ENTRANCE TO THE PALACE WAS NOT THROUGH THE GARDEN IN WHICH STILLNESS AND PRIVACY ALWAYS REIGNED SHE WISHED RATHER TO FORESTALL HIS ARRIVAL BY A PROCESS OF CONJECTURE AND TO JUDGE BY THE EXPRESSION OF HER FACE THIS ATTEMPT GAVE HER PLENTY TO DO
1926-143879-0006 GRAVE SHE FOUND HERSELF AND POSITIVELY MORE WEIGHTED AS BY THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAPSE OF THE YEAR SHE HAD SPENT IN SEEING THE WORLD
1926-143879-0007 A VERY DIFFERENT PERSON FROM THE FRIVOLOUS YOUNG WOMAN FROM ALBANY WHO HAD BEGUN TO TAKE THE MEASURE OF EUROPE ON THE LAWN AT GARDENCOURT A COUPLE OF YEARS BEFORE
1926-143879-0008 IF HER THOUGHTS JUST NOW HAD INCLINED THEMSELVES TO RETROSPECT INSTEAD OF FLUTTERING THEIR WINGS NERVOUSLY ABOUT THE PRESENT
1926-143879-0009 WITH SEVERAL OF THE IMAGES THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROJECTED ON SUCH A FIELD WE ARE ALREADY ACQUAINTED
1926-143879-0010 SHE HAD LEFT HER HUSBAND BEHIND HER BUT HAD BROUGHT HER CHILDREN TO WHOM ISABEL NOW PLAYED WITH EQUAL MUNIFICENCE AND TENDERNESS THE PART OF MAIDEN AUNT MISTER LUDLOW
1926-143879-0011 THE LITTLE LUDLOWS HAD NOT YET EVEN FROM THE AMERICAN POINT OF VIEW
1926-143879-0012 LILY AND THE BABIES HAD JOINED HER IN SWITZERLAND IN THE MONTH OF JULY AND THEY HAD SPENT A SUMMER OF FINE WEATHER IN AN ALPINE VALLEY WHERE THE FLOWERS WERE THICK IN THE MEADOWS
1926-143879-0013 AND THE SHADE OF GREAT CHESTNUTS MADE A RESTING PLACE FOR SUCH UPWARD WANDERINGS AS MIGHT BE UNDERTAKEN BY LADIES AND CHILDREN ON WARM AFTERNOONS THEY HAD AFTERWARDS REACHED THE FRENCH CAPITAL WHICH WAS WORSHIPPED
1926-143879-0014 AND WITH COSTLY CEREMONIES BY LILY BUT THOUGHT OF AS NOISILY VACANT BY ISABEL WHO IN THESE DAYS MADE
1926-143879-0015 MISSUS LUDLOW SACRIFICED AS I SAY TO PARIS YET HAD DOUBTS AND WONDERMENTS NOT ALLAYED AT THAT ALTAR AND AFTER HER HUSBAND HAD JOINED HER FOUND FURTHER CHAGRIN IN HIS FAILURE TO THROW HIMSELF INTO THESE SPECULATIONS
1926-143879-0016 MISSUS LUDLOW'S MENTAL MOTIONS WERE SUFFICIENTLY VARIOUS
1926-143879-0017 WHICH HAD AN ELEGANT CONSERVATORY AND WAS JUST ROUND THE CORNER FROM HER OWN AT ANOTHER
1926-143879-0018 ON THE WHOLE AS I HAVE SAID SHE HAD FALLEN FROM HIGH COMMUNION WITH THE PROBABILITIES
1926-143879-0019 ISABEL HAD DEVELOPED LESS HOWEVER THAN LILY HAD THOUGHT LIKELY DEVELOPMENT TO LILY'S UNDERSTANDING BEING SOMEHOW MYSTERIOUSLY CONNECTED WITH MORNING CALLS AND EVENING PARTIES INTELLECTUALLY DOUBTLESS SHE HAD MADE IMMENSE STRIDES
1926-143879-0020 THE TROPHIES LILY'S CONCEPTION OF SUCH ACHIEVEMENTS WAS EXTREMELY VAGUE BUT THIS WAS EXACTLY WHAT SHE HAD EXPECTED OF ISABEL TO GIVE IT FORM AND BODY
1926-143879-0021 WE KNOW OURSELVES THAT ISABEL HAD MADE CONQUESTS WHETHER INFERIOR OR NOT TO THOSE SHE MIGHT HAVE EFFECTED IN HER NATIVE LAND
1926-143879-0022 THAN THAT SHE DIDN'T WISH TO SPEAK IT WAS MORE ROMANTIC TO SAY NOTHING AND DRINKING DEEP IN SECRET OF ROMANCE SHE WAS AS LITTLE DISPOSED TO ASK POOR LILY'S ADVICE AS SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO CLOSE THAT RARE VOLUME FOREVER
1926-143879-0023 BUT LILY KNEW NOTHING OF THESE DISCRIMINATIONS AND COULD ONLY PRONOUNCE HER SISTER'S CAREER A STRANGE ANTI CLIMAX AN IMPRESSION CONFIRMED BY THE FACT THAT ISABEL'S SILENCE ABOUT MISTER OSMOND FOR INSTANCE
1926-143879-0024 WAS IN DIRECT PROPORTION TO THE FREQUENCY WITH WHICH HE OCCUPIED HER THOUGHTS AS THIS HAPPENED VERY OFTEN IT SOMETIMES APPEARED TO MISSUS LUDLOW THAT SHE HAD LOST HER COURAGE SO UNCANNY A RESULT OF SO EXHILARATING AN INCIDENT AS INHERITING A FORTUNE
1926-143879-0025 IT MADE LILY SO FIDGETY AND SHE ASKED SUCH IMPOSSIBLE QUESTIONS ISABEL WATCHED THE TRAIN MOVE AWAY SHE KISSED HER HAND TO THE ELDER OF HER SMALL NEPHEWS
1926-143879-0026 THE EARLY DUSK OF A NOVEMBER AFTERNOON HAD ALREADY CLOSED IN THE STREET LAMPS IN THE THICK BROWN AIR LOOKED WEAK AND RED
1926-143879-0027 AND EUSTON SQUARE WAS A LONG WAY FROM PICCADILLY BUT ISABEL PERFORMED THE JOURNEY WITH A POSITIVE ENJOYMENT OF ITS DANGERS AND LOST HER WAY ALMOST ON PURPOSE IN ORDER TO GET MORE SENSATIONS SO THAT SHE WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN AN OBLIGING POLICEMAN EASILY
1926-143879-0028 SET HER RIGHT AGAIN SHE WAS SO FOND OF THE SPECTACLE OF HUMAN LIFE THAT SHE ENJOYED EVEN THE ASPECT OF GATHERING DUSK IN THE LONDON STREETS THE MOVING CROWDS THE HURRYING CABS THE LIGHTED SHOPS THE FLARING STALLS THE DARK
1926-143879-0029 SHE MADE HER WAY DOWN TO ROME WITHOUT TOUCHING AT FLORENCE
1926-143879-0030 IN THE SEPTEMBER PREVIOUS HAD BEEN RECALLED TO AMERICA BY A TELEGRAM FROM THE INTERVIEWER
1926-143879-0031 AND HENRIETTA WAS CHEERED ON HER WAY BY A PROMISE FROM MISTER BANTLING THAT HE WOULD SOON COME OVER
1926-143879-0032 HAD NOT BEEN A FORTNIGHT IN ROME BEFORE SHE PROPOSED TO MADAME MERLE THAT THEY SHOULD MAKE A LITTLE PILGRIMAGE TO THE EAST MADAME MERLE REMARKED THAT HER FRIEND WAS RESTLESS
1926-143879-0033 BUT SHE ADDED THAT SHE HERSELF HAD ALWAYS BEEN CONSUMED WITH THE DESIRE TO VISIT ATHENS AND CONSTANTINOPLE THE TWO LADIES ACCORDINGLY EMBARKED ON THIS EXPEDITION AND SPENT THREE MONTHS IN GREECE IN TURKEY IN EGYPT
1926-143879-0034 ISABEL FOUND MUCH TO INTEREST HER IN THESE COUNTRIES THOUGH MADAME MERLE CONTINUED TO REMARK THAT EVEN AMONG THE MOST CLASSIC SITES
1926-143879-0035 HER CHARACTER HAD REVEALED ITSELF
1926-143879-0036 A CONSUMMATION THE MORE DESIRABLE
1926-143879-0037 SHE CONSIDERED WITH THE PRESUMPTION OF YOUTH THAT A MORALITY DIFFERING FROM HER OWN MUST BE INFERIOR TO IT
1926-143879-0038 AN OCCASIONAL LAPSE FROM CANDOUR IN THE CONVERSATION OF A PERSON WHO HAD RAISED DELICATE KINDNESS TO AN ART AND WHOSE PRIDE WAS TOO HIGH FOR THE NARROW WAYS OF DECEPTION
1926-143879-0039 AND THERE WERE SEVERAL IN HER LIST OF WHICH OUR HEROINE HAD NOT EVEN HEARD SHE HAD NOT HEARD OF EVERYTHING THAT WAS VERY PLAIN
1926-143879-0040 ADVANTAGEOUS TO HEAR SHE HAD ONCE OR TWICE HAD A POSITIVE SCARE SINCE IT SO AFFECTED HER TO HAVE TO EXCLAIM OF HER FRIEND
1926-143879-0041 BUT IT STOOD FOR A HIGH WATER MARK IN THE EBB AND FLOW OF CONFIDENCE MADAME MERLE HAD ONCE DECLARED HER BELIEF THAT WHEN A FRIENDSHIP CEASES TO GROW IT IMMEDIATELY BEGINS TO DECLINE THERE BEING NO POINT OF EQUILIBRIUM BETWEEN LIKING MORE AND LIKING LESS
1926-143879-0042 A STATIONARY AFFECTION IN OTHER WORDS WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT MUST MOVE ONE WAY OR THE OTHER HOWEVER THAT MIGHT BE THE GIRL HAD IN THESE DAYS A THOUSAND USES FOR HER SENSE OF THE ROMANTIC WHICH WAS MORE ACTIVE THAN IT HAD EVER BEEN
1926-143879-0043 I DO NOT ALLUDE TO THE IMPULSE IT RECEIVED AS SHE GAZED AT THE PYRAMIDS IN THE COURSE OF AN EXCURSION FROM CAIRO OR AS SHE STOOD AMONG THE BROKEN COLUMNS OF THE ACROPOLIS AND FIXED HER EYES UPON THE POINT DESIGNATED TO HER AS THE STRAIT OF SALAMIS
1926-143879-0044 DEEP AND MEMORABLE AS THESE EMOTIONS HAD REMAINED SHE CAME BACK BY THE LAST OF MARCH FROM EGYPT AND GREECE AND MADE ANOTHER STAY IN ROME A FEW DAYS AFTER HER ARRIVAL
1926-143879-0045 DURING WHICH THE FACT OF HER BEING WITH HIS OLD FRIEND MADAME MERLE IN WHOSE HOUSE SHE HAD GONE TO LODGE MADE IT VIRTUALLY INEVITABLE THAT HE SHOULD SEE HER EVERY DAY WHEN THE LAST OF APRIL CAME
1926-143879-0046 AND WENT TO PAY A VISIT AT PALAZZO CRESCENTINI MADAME MERLE ON THIS OCCASION REMAINING IN ROME
1926-147979-0000 WINTER LIES TOO LONG IN COUNTRY TOWNS HANGS ON UNTIL IT IS STALE AND SHABBY OLD AND SULLEN ON THE FARM THE WEATHER WAS THE GREAT FACT AND MEN'S AFFAIRS WENT ON UNDERNEATH IT AS THE STREAMS CREEP UNDER THE ICE
1926-147979-0001 BUT IN BLACK HAWK THE SCENE OF HUMAN LIFE WAS SPREAD OUT SHRUNKEN AND PINCHED FROZEN DOWN TO THE BARE STALK
1926-147979-0002 THROUGH JANUARY AND FEBRUARY I WENT TO THE RIVER WITH THE HARLINGS ON CLEAR NIGHTS AND WE SKATED UP TO THE BIG ISLAND AND MADE BONFIRES ON THE FROZEN SAND BUT BY MARCH THE ICE WAS ROUGH AND CHOPPY
1926-147979-0003 AT OUR COMFORTABLE HOTEL MISSUS HARLING HAD KNOWN D'ARNAULT FOR YEARS
1926-147979-0004 THE WIND FROM WITHOUT MADE WAVES IN THE LONG CARPET A COAL STOVE GLOWED AT EITHER END OF THE ROOM AND THE GRAND PIANO IN THE MIDDLE STOOD OPEN THERE WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF UNUSUAL FREEDOM ABOUT THE HOUSE THAT NIGHT
1926-147979-0005 FOR MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA FOR A WEEK JOHNNIE HAD BEEN HAVING DRINKS WITH THE GUESTS UNTIL HE WAS RATHER ABSENT MINDED IT WAS MISSUS GARDENER WHO RAN THE BUSINESS AND LOOKED AFTER EVERYTHING HER HUSBAND STOOD AT THE DESK AND WELCOMED INCOMING TRAVELERS
1926-147979-0006 HE WAS A POPULAR FELLOW BUT NO MANAGER MISSUS GARDENER WAS ADMITTEDLY THE BEST DRESSED WOMAN IN BLACK HAWK DROVE THE BEST HORSE AND HAD A SMART TRAP AND A LITTLE WHITE AND GOLD SLEIGH
1926-147979-0007 SHE SEEMED INDIFFERENT TO HER POSSESSIONS WAS NOT HALF SO SOLICITOUS ABOUT THEM AS HER FRIENDS WERE SHE WAS TALL DARK SEVERE WITH SOMETHING INDIAN LIKE IN THE RIGID IMMOBILITY OF HER FACE HER MANNER WAS COLD AND SHE TALKED LITTLE
1926-147979-0008 GUESTS FELT THAT THEY WERE RECEIVING NOT CONFERRING A FAVOR WHEN THEY STAYED AT HER HOUSE EVEN THE SMARTEST TRAVELING MEN WERE FLATTERED WHEN MISSUS GARDENER STOPPED TO CHAT WITH THEM FOR A MOMENT
1926-147979-0009 TWO CLASSES THOSE WHO HAD SEEN MISSUS GARDENER'S DIAMONDS AND THOSE WHO HAD NOT WHEN I STOLE INTO THE PARLOR ANSON KIRKPATRICK MARSHALL FIELD'S MAN
1926-147979-0010 HE WAS A DAPPER LITTLE IRISHMAN VERY VAIN HOMELY AS A MONKEY WITH FRIENDS EVERYWHERE AND A SWEETHEART IN EVERY PORT LIKE A SAILOR I DID NOT KNOW ALL THE MEN WHO WERE SITTING ABOUT BUT I RECOGNIZED A FURNITURE SALESMAN FROM KANSAS CITY
1926-147979-0011 A DRUG MAN AND WILLY O'REILLY WHO TRAVELED FOR A JEWELRY HOUSE AND SOLD MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS THE TALK WAS ALL ABOUT GOOD AND BAD HOTELS ACTORS AND ACTRESSES AND MUSICAL PRODIGIES I LEARNED THAT MISSUS GARDENER HAD GONE TO OMAHA TO HEAR BOOTH AND BARRETT
1926-147979-0012 WHO WERE TO PLAY THERE NEXT WEEK AND THAT MARY ANDERSON WAS HAVING A GREAT SUCCESS IN A WINTER'S TALE IN LONDON THE DOOR FROM THE OFFICE OPENED AND JOHNNIE GARDENER CAME IN DIRECTING BLIND D'ARNAULT HE WOULD NEVER CONSENT TO BE LED
1926-147979-0013 HIS YELLOW FACE WAS LIFTED IN THE LIGHT WITH A SHOW OF WHITE TEETH ALL GRINNING AND HIS SHRUNKEN PAPERY EYELIDS LAY MOTIONLESS OVER HIS BLIND EYES GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN NO LADIES HERE GOOD EVENING GENTLEMEN
1926-147979-0014 WE GOING TO HAVE A LITTLE MUSIC SOME OF YOU GENTLEMEN GOING TO PLAY FOR ME THIS EVENING IT WAS THE SOFT AMIABLE NEGRO VOICE LIKE THOSE I REMEMBERED FROM EARLY CHILDHOOD WITH THE NOTE OF DOCILE SUBSERVIENCE IN IT
1926-147979-0015 HE HAD THE NEGRO HEAD TOO ALMOST NO HEAD AT ALL NOTHING BEHIND THE EARS BUT FOLDS OF NECK UNDER CLOSE CLIPPED WOOL
1926-147979-0016 WHEN HE WAS SITTING OR STANDING STILL HE SWAYED BACK AND FORTH INCESSANTLY LIKE A ROCKING TOY AT THE PIANO HE SWAYED IN TIME TO THE MUSIC AND WHEN HE WAS NOT PLAYING HIS BODY KEPT UP THIS MOTION LIKE AN EMPTY MILL GRINDING ON
1926-147979-0017 NOW GENTLEMEN I EXPECT YOU'VE ALL GOT GRAND VOICES SEEMS LIKE WE MIGHT HAVE SOME GOOD OLD PLANTATION SONGS TO NIGHT THE MEN GATHERED ROUND HIM AS HE BEGAN TO PLAY MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME THEY SANG ONE NEGRO MELODY AFTER ANOTHER
1926-147979-0018 WHILE THE MULATTO SAT ROCKING HIMSELF HIS HEAD THROWN BACK HIS YELLOW FACE LIFTED ITS SHRIVELED EYELIDS NEVER FLUTTERING HE WAS BORN IN THE FAR SOUTH ON THE D'ARNAULT PLANTATION WHERE THE SPIRIT IF NOT THE FACT OF SLAVERY PERSISTED
1926-147979-0019 WHEN HE WAS THREE WEEKS OLD HE HAD AN ILLNESS WHICH LEFT HIM TOTALLY BLIND
1926-147979-0020 HIS MOTHER A BUXOM YOUNG NEGRO WENCH WHO WAS LAUNDRESS FOR THE D'ARNAULTS CONCLUDED THAT HER BLIND BABY WAS NOT RIGHT IN HIS HEAD AND SHE WAS ASHAMED OF HIM SHE LOVED HIM DEVOTEDLY BUT HE WAS SO UGLY WITH HIS SUNKEN EYES AND HIS FIDGETS
1926-147979-0021 THAT SHE HID HIM AWAY FROM PEOPLE ALL THE DAINTIES SHE BROUGHT DOWN FROM THE BIG HOUSE WERE FOR THE BLIND CHILD AND SHE BEAT AND CUFFED HER OTHER CHILDREN WHENEVER SHE FOUND THEM TEASING HIM OR TRYING TO GET HIS CHICKEN BONE AWAY FROM HIM HE BEGAN TO TALK EARLY
1926-147979-0022 AND HIS MAMMY SAID HE WAS N'T ALL WRONG SHE NAMED HIM SAMSON BECAUSE HE WAS BLIND BUT ON THE PLANTATION HE WAS KNOWN AS YELLOW MARTHA'S SIMPLE CHILD
1926-147979-0023 HE WAS DOCILE AND OBEDIENT BUT WHEN HE WAS SIX YEARS OLD HE BEGAN TO RUN AWAY FROM HOME ALWAYS TAKING THE SAME DIRECTION HE FELT HIS WAY THROUGH THE LILACS ALONG THE BOXWOOD HEDGE
1926-147979-0024 WHENEVER SHE CAUGHT HIM SLIPPING AWAY FROM THE CABIN SHE WHIPPED HIM UNMERCIFULLY AND TOLD HIM WHAT DREADFUL THINGS OLD MISTER D'ARNAULT WOULD DO TO HIM IF HE EVER FOUND HIM NEAR THE BIG HOUSE BUT THE NEXT TIME SAMSON HAD A CHANCE HE RAN AWAY AGAIN
1926-147979-0025 AND WENT TOWARD THE WINDOW SHE SAW THIS HIDEOUS LITTLE PICKANINNY DRESSED IN AN OLD PIECE OF SACKING STANDING IN THE OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE HOLLYHOCK ROWS HIS BODY ROCKING AUTOMATICALLY HIS BLIND FACE LIFTED
1926-147979-0026 THOUGH IT DID NOT OCCUR TO HER THAT HE MIGHT HAVE MORE OF IT THAN OTHER CHILDREN ONE DAY SAMSON WAS STANDING THUS WHILE MISS NELLIE WAS PLAYING HER LESSON TO HER MUSIC MASTER THE WINDOWS WERE OPEN
1926-147979-0027 TALK A LITTLE WHILE AND THEN LEAVE THE ROOM HE HEARD THE DOOR CLOSE AFTER THEM HE CREPT UP TO THE FRONT WINDOWS AND STUCK HIS HEAD IN THERE WAS NO ONE THERE HE COULD ALWAYS DETECT THE PRESENCE OF ANY ONE IN A ROOM
1926-147979-0028 HE PUT ONE FOOT OVER THE WINDOW SILL AND STRADDLED IT HIS MOTHER HAD TOLD HIM OVER AND OVER HOW HIS MASTER WOULD GIVE HIM TO THE BIG MASTIFF IF HE EVER FOUND HIM MEDDLING SAMSON HAD GOT TOO NEAR THE MASTIFF'S KENNEL ONCE AND HAD FELT HIS TERRIBLE BREATH IN HIS FACE
1926-147979-0029 HE THOUGHT ABOUT THAT BUT HE PULLED IN HIS OTHER FOOT THROUGH THE DARK HE FOUND HIS WAY TO THE THING TO ITS MOUTH HE TOUCHED IT SOFTLY AND IT ANSWERED SOFTLY KINDLY HE SHIVERED AND STOOD STILL
1926-147979-0030 THEN HE BEGAN TO FEEL IT ALL OVER RAN HIS FINGER TIPS ALONG THE SLIPPERY SIDES EMBRACED THE CARVED LEGS TRIED TO GET SOME CONCEPTION OF ITS SHAPE AND SIZE OF THE SPACE IT OCCUPIED IN PRIMEVAL NIGHT
1926-147979-0031 IT WAS COLD AND HARD AND LIKE NOTHING ELSE IN HIS BLACK UNIVERSE HE WENT BACK TO ITS MOUTH BEGAN AT ONE END OF THE KEYBOARD AND FELT HIS WAY DOWN INTO THE MELLOW THUNDER AS FAR AS HE COULD GO
1926-147979-0032 HE SEEMED TO KNOW THAT IT MUST BE DONE WITH THE FINGERS NOT WITH THE FISTS OR THE FEET HE APPROACHED THIS HIGHLY ARTIFICIAL INSTRUMENT THROUGH A MERE INSTINCT AND COUPLED HIMSELF TO IT AS IF HE KNEW IT WAS TO PIECE HIM OUT AND MAKE A WHOLE CREATURE OF HIM
1926-147979-0033 THAT LAY UNDER THE BONES OF HIS PINCHED CONICAL LITTLE SKULL DEFINITE AS ANIMAL DESIRES THE DOOR OPENED MISS NELLIE AND HER MUSIC MASTER STOOD BEHIND IT BUT BLIND SAMSON WHO WAS SO SENSITIVE TO PRESENCES DID NOT KNOW THEY WERE THERE
1926-147979-0034 HE WAS FEELING OUT THE PATTERN THAT LAY ALL READY MADE ON THE BIG AND LITTLE KEYS WHEN HE PAUSED FOR A MOMENT BECAUSE THE SOUND WAS WRONG AND HE WANTED ANOTHER MISS NELLIE SPOKE SOFTLY HE WHIRLED ABOUT IN A SPASM OF TERROR
1926-147979-0035 LEAPED FORWARD IN THE DARK STRUCK HIS HEAD ON THE OPEN WINDOW AND FELL SCREAMING AND BLEEDING TO THE FLOOR HE HAD WHAT HIS MOTHER CALLED A FIT THE DOCTOR CAME AND GAVE HIM OPIUM WHEN SAMSON WAS WELL AGAIN HIS YOUNG MISTRESS LED HIM BACK TO THE PIANO
1926-147979-0036 SEVERAL TEACHERS EXPERIMENTED WITH HIM THEY FOUND HE HAD ABSOLUTE PITCH AND A REMARKABLE MEMORY AS A VERY YOUNG CHILD HE COULD REPEAT AFTER A FASHION ANY COMPOSITION THAT WAS PLAYED FOR HIM NO MATTER HOW MANY WRONG NOTES HE STRUCK HE NEVER LOST THE INTENTION OF A PASSAGE
1926-147979-0037 AS PIANO PLAYING IT WAS PERHAPS ABOMINABLE BUT AS MUSIC IT WAS SOMETHING REAL VITALIZED BY A SENSE OF RHYTHM THAT WAS STRONGER THAN HIS OTHER PHYSICAL SENSES THAT NOT ONLY FILLED HIS DARK MIND BUT WORRIED HIS BODY INCESSANTLY
1926-147979-0038 AND HE WERE GLOATING OVER THEM AND TRICKLING THEM THROUGH HIS YELLOW FINGERS IN THE MIDDLE OF A CRASHING WALTZ D'ARNAULT SUDDENLY BEGAN TO PLAY SOFTLY AND TURNING TO ONE OF THE MEN WHO STOOD BEHIND HIM WHISPERED
1926-147979-0039 SOMEBODY DANCING IN THERE HE JERKED HIS BULLET HEAD TOWARD THE DINING ROOM I HEAR LITTLE FEET GIRLS I SPECT ANSON KIRKPATRICK MOUNTED A CHAIR AND PEEPED OVER THE TRANSOM
1926-147979-0040 SPRINGING DOWN HE WRENCHED OPEN THE DOORS AND RAN OUT INTO THE DINING ROOM TINY AND LENA ANTONIA AND MARY DUSAK WERE WALTZING IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FLOOR THEY SEPARATED AND FLED TOWARD THE KITCHEN GIGGLING KIRKPATRICK CAUGHT TINY BY THE ELBOWS

1926-147979-0046 AND ON HIS WATCH CASE DOUBTLESS ON HIS HEART TOO HE WAS AN AFFECTIONATE LITTLE MAN AND HE THOUGHT HIS WIFE A WONDERFUL WOMAN HE KNEW THAT WITHOUT HER HE WOULD HARDLY BE MORE THAN A CLERK IN SOME OTHER MAN'S HOTEL AT A WORD FROM KIRKPATRICK
1926-147979-0047 OVER THE PIANO AND BEGAN TO DRAW THE DANCE MUSIC OUT OF IT WHILE THE PERSPIRATION SHONE ON HIS SHORT WOOL AND ON HIS UPLIFTED FACE
1926-147979-0048 WHENEVER THE DANCERS PAUSED TO CHANGE PARTNERS OR TO CATCH BREATH HE WOULD BOOM OUT SOFTLY WHO'S THAT GOIN BACK ON ME ONE OF THESE CITY GENTLEMEN I BET NOW YOU GIRLS
1926-147979-0049 ANTONIA SEEMED FRIGHTENED AT FIRST
1926-147979-0050 TINY SODERBALL WAS TRIM AND SLENDER WITH LIVELY LITTLE FEET AND PRETTY ANKLES SHE WORE HER DRESSES VERY SHORT SHE WAS QUICKER IN SPEECH LIGHTER IN MOVEMENT AND MANNER THAN THE OTHER GIRLS MARY DUSAK WAS BROAD AND
1926-147979-0051 SHE LOOKED BOLD AND RESOURCEFUL AND UNSCRUPULOUS AND SHE WAS ALL OF THESE THEY WERE HANDSOME GIRLS HAD THE FRESH COLOR OF THEIR COUNTRY UP BRINGING AND IN THEIR EYES THAT BRILLIANCY WHICH IS CALLED BY NO METAPHOR ALAS
1926-147979-0052 THE LIGHT OF YOUTH D'ARNAULT PLAYED UNTIL HIS MANAGER CAME AND SHUT THE PIANO BEFORE HE LEFT US HE SHOWED US HIS GOLD WATCH WHICH STRUCK THE HOURS AND A TOPAZ RING GIVEN HIM BY SOME RUSSIAN NOBLEMAN WHO DELIGHTED IN NEGRO MELODIES
1926-147979-0053 AND HAD HEARD D'ARNAULT PLAY IN NEW ORLEANS AT LAST HE TAPPED HIS WAY UPSTAIRS AFTER BOWING TO EVERYBODY DOCILE AND HAPPY I WALKED HOME WITH ANTONIA WE WERE SO EXCITED THAT WE DREADED TO GO TO BED
1926-147987-0000 THE DAY AFTER THE CUTTERS LEFT ANTONIA CAME OVER TO SEE US GRANDMOTHER NOTICED THAT SHE SEEMED TROUBLED AND DISTRACTED YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING ON YOUR MIND ANTONIA SHE SAID ANXIOUSLY
1926-147987-0001 SHE HESITATED AND THEN TOLD US HOW STRANGELY MISTER CUTTER HAD BEHAVED BEFORE HE WENT AWAY
1926-147987-0002 AS HE HAD JUST PUT A NEW YALE LOCK ON THE FRONT DOOR CUTTER HAD BEEN SO INSISTENT IN REGARD TO THESE DETAILS THAT NOW SHE FELT UNCOMFORTABLE ABOUT STAYING THERE ALONE
1926-147987-0003 OR THE WAY HE LOOKED AT HER I FEEL AS IF HE IS UP TO SOME OF HIS TRICKS AGAIN
1926-147987-0004 GRANDMOTHER WAS APPREHENSIVE AT ONCE I DON'T THINK IT'S RIGHT FOR YOU TO STAY THERE FEELING THAT WAY I SUPPOSE IT WOULD N'T BE RIGHT FOR YOU TO LEAVE THE PLACE ALONE EITHER
1926-147987-0005 MAYBE JIM WOULD BE WILLING TO GO OVER THERE AND SLEEP AND YOU COULD COME HERE NIGHTS I'D FEEL SAFER KNOWING YOU WERE UNDER MY OWN ROOF I GUESS JIM COULD TAKE CARE OF THEIR SILVER AND OLD USURY NOTES AS WELL AS YOU COULD
1926-147987-0006 ANTONIA TURNED TO ME EAGERLY OH WOULD YOU JIM
1926-147987-0007 THE THIRD NIGHT I SPENT AT THE CUTTERS I AWOKE SUDDENLY WITH THE IMPRESSION THAT I HAD HEARD A DOOR OPEN AND SHUT EVERYTHING WAS STILL HOWEVER AND I MUST HAVE GONE TO SLEEP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
1926-147987-0008 I WAS ONLY HALF AWAKE BUT I DECIDED THAT HE MIGHT TAKE THE CUTTERS SILVER WHOEVER HE WAS
1926-147987-0009 I HELD MY BREATH AND LAY ABSOLUTELY STILL A HAND CLOSED SOFTLY ON MY SHOULDER AND AT THE SAME MOMENT I FELT SOMETHING HAIRY AND COLOGNE SCENTED BRUSHING MY FACE
1926-147987-0010 THE MAN BECAME INSANE HE STOOD OVER ME CHOKING ME WITH ONE FIST AND BEATING ME IN THE FACE WITH THE OTHER HISSING AND CHUCKLING AND LETTING OUT A FLOOD OF ABUSE SO THIS IS WHAT SHE'S UP TO WHEN I'M AWAY IS IT WHERE IS SHE YOU NASTY WHELP

1926-147987-0012 WHEN I GOT HOME I CLIMBED IN AT THE KITCHEN WINDOW I WAS COVERED WITH BLOOD FROM MY NOSE AND LIP BUT I WAS TOO SICK TO DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT I FOUND A SHAWL AND AN OVERCOAT ON THE HATRACK LAY DOWN ON THE PARLOR SOFA AND IN SPITE OF MY HURTS WENT TO SLEEP
1926-147987-0013 HER CRY OF FRIGHT AWAKENED ME TRULY I WAS A BATTERED OBJECT AS SHE HELPED ME TO MY ROOM I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF MYSELF IN THE MIRROR MY LIP WAS CUT AND STOOD OUT LIKE A SNOUT MY NOSE LOOKED LIKE A BIG BLUE PLUM
1926-147987-0014 AND ONE EYE WAS SWOLLEN SHUT AND HIDEOUSLY DISCOLORED GRANDMOTHER SAID WE MUST HAVE THE DOCTOR AT ONCE BUT I IMPLORED HER AS I HAD NEVER BEGGED FOR ANYTHING BEFORE NOT TO SEND FOR HIM I COULD STAND ANYTHING I TOLD HER
1926-147987-0015 SHE SEEMED TO UNDERSTAND THOUGH I WAS TOO FAINT AND MISERABLE TO GO INTO EXPLANATIONS WHEN SHE TOOK
1926-147987-0016 SHE SPENT THE WHOLE MORNING BATHING AND POULTICING ME AND RUBBING ME WITH ARNICA I HEARD ANTONIA SOBBING OUTSIDE MY DOOR BUT I ASKED GRANDMOTHER TO SEND HER AWAY I FELT THAT I NEVER WANTED TO SEE HER AGAIN
1926-147987-0017 SHE HAD LET ME IN FOR ALL THIS DISGUSTINGNESS GRANDMOTHER KEPT SAYING HOW THANKFUL WE OUGHT TO BE THAT I HAD BEEN THERE INSTEAD OF ANTONIA BUT I LAY WITH MY DISFIGURED FACE TO THE WALL AND FELT NO PARTICULAR GRATITUDE
1926-147987-0018 IF THE STORY ONCE GOT ABROAD I WOULD NEVER HEAR THE LAST OF IT I COULD WELL IMAGINE WHAT THE OLD MEN DOWN AT THE DRUG STORE WOULD DO WITH SUCH A THEME
1926-147987-0019 AND HAD LEFT AGAIN ON THE SIX O'CLOCK TRAIN FOR DENVER THAT MORNING THE AGENT SAID HIS FACE WAS STRIPED WITH COURT PLASTER AND HE CARRIED HIS LEFT HAND IN A SLING HE LOOKED SO USED UP THAT THE AGENT ASKED HIM WHAT HAD HAPPENED TO HIM SINCE TEN O'CLOCK THE NIGHT BEFORE
1926-147987-0020 MY OWN GARMENTS HAD BEEN TREATED SO BADLY THAT I NEVER SAW THEM AGAIN GRANDMOTHER BURNED THEM IN THE CUTTERS KITCHEN RANGE WHILE ANTONIA WAS PACKING HER TRUNK AND PUTTING HER ROOM IN ORDER TO LEAVE IT THE FRONT DOOR BELL RANG VIOLENTLY
1926-147987-0021 THERE STOOD MISSUS CUTTER LOCKED OUT FOR SHE HAD NO KEY TO THE NEW LOCK HER HEAD TREMBLING WITH RAGE I ADVISED HER TO CONTROL HERSELF OR SHE WOULD HAVE A STROKE GRANDMOTHER SAID AFTERWARDS
1926-147987-0022 ANTONIA WAS FRIGHTENED AND WAS GOING HOME TO STAY FOR A WHILE SHE TOLD MISSUS CUTTER IT WOULD BE USELESS TO INTERROGATE THE GIRL FOR SHE KNEW NOTHING OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED THEN MISSUS CUTTER TOLD HER STORY
1926-147987-0023 SHE AND HER HUSBAND HAD STARTED HOME FROM OMAHA TOGETHER THE MORNING BEFORE THEY HAD TO STOP OVER SEVERAL HOURS AT WAYMORE JUNCTION TO CATCH THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN
1926-147987-0024 WHEN HE RETURNED HE TOLD HER THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO STAY OVERNIGHT THERE
1926-147987-0025 SHE SAW HIM SLIP A TWENTY DOLLAR BILL INTO HER HANDBAG WITH HER TICKET THAT BILL SHE SAID SHOULD HAVE AROUSED HER SUSPICIONS AT ONCE BUT DID NOT THE TRAINS ARE NEVER CALLED AT LITTLE JUNCTION TOWNS EVERYBODY KNOWS WHEN THEY COME IN
1926-147987-0026 MISTER CUTTER SHOWED HIS WIFE'S TICKET TO THE CONDUCTOR AND SETTLED HER IN HER SEAT BEFORE THE TRAIN MOVED OFF
1926-147987-0027 AND THAT CUTTER MUST HAVE PLANNED IT SO THE CONDUCTOR TOLD HER THE BLACK HAWK TRAIN WAS DUE AT WAYMORE TWELVE MINUTES AFTER THE KANSAS CITY TRAIN LEFT SHE SAW AT ONCE THAT HER HUSBAND HAD PLAYED THIS TRICK IN ORDER TO GET BACK TO BLACK HAWK WITHOUT HER
1926-147987-0028 SHE HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO GO ON TO KANSAS CITY AND TAKE THE FIRST FAST TRAIN FOR HOME CUTTER COULD HAVE GOT HOME A DAY EARLIER THAN HIS WIFE BY ANY ONE OF A DOZEN SIMPLER DEVICES HE COULD HAVE LEFT HER IN THE OMAHA HOTEL
1926-147987-0029 BUT APPARENTLY IT WAS PART OF HIS FUN TO OUTRAGE HER FEELINGS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE MISTER CUTTER WILL PAY FOR THIS MISSUS BURDEN HE WILL PAY MISSUS CUTTER AVOUCHED NODDING HER HORSELIKE HEAD AND ROLLING HER EYES
1926-147987-0030 CERTAINLY CUTTER LIKED TO HAVE HIS WIFE THINK HIM A DEVIL IN SOME WAY HE DEPENDED UPON THE EXCITEMENT HE COULD AROUSE IN HER HYSTERICAL NATURE PERHAPS HE GOT THE FEELING OF BEING A RAKE MORE FROM HIS WIFE'S RAGE AND AMAZEMENT
1926-147987-0031 THAN FROM ANY EXPERIENCES OF HIS OWN HIS ZEST IN DEBAUCHERY MIGHT WANE BUT NEVER MISSUS CUTTER'S BELIEF IN IT THE RECKONING WITH HIS WIFE AT THE END OF AN ESCAPADE WAS SOMETHING HE COUNTED ON
196-122150-0000 CHAPTER TWO AFTER TWO YEARS OF TRAINING HE WENT TO SEA AND ENTERING THE REGIONS SO WELL KNOWN TO HIS IMAGINATION FOUND THEM STRANGELY BARREN OF ADVENTURE HE MADE MANY VOYAGES
196-122150-0001 HE KNEW THE MAGIC MONOTONY OF EXISTENCE BETWEEN SKY AND WATER HE HAD TO BEAR THE CRITICISM OF MEN THE EXACTIONS OF THE SEA AND THE PROSAIC SEVERITY OF THE DAILY TASK THAT GIVES BREAD BUT WHOSE ONLY REWARD IS IN THE PERFECT LOVE OF THE WORK
196-122150-0002 THE EDGE OF HIS TEMPER AND THE FIBRE OF HIS STUFF THAT REVEAL THE QUALITY OF HIS RESISTANCE AND THE SECRET TRUTH OF HIS PRETENCES NOT ONLY TO OTHERS BUT ALSO TO HIMSELF
196-122150-0003 THERE ARE MANY SHADES IN THE DANGER OF ADVENTURES AND GALES AND IT IS ONLY NOW AND THEN THAT THERE APPEARS ON THE FACE OF FACTS A SINISTER VIOLENCE OF INTENTION THAT INDEFINABLE SOMETHING WHICH FORCES IT UPON THE MIND AND THE HEART OF A MAN
196-122150-0004 THAT THIS COMPLICATION OF ACCIDENTS OR THESE ELEMENTAL FURIES ARE COMING AT HIM WITH A PURPOSE OF MALICE WITH A STRENGTH BEYOND CONTROL WITH AN UNBRIDLED CRUELTY THAT MEANS TO TEAR OUT OF HIM HIS HOPE AND HIS FEAR
196-122150-0005 THE SUNSHINE THE MEMORIES THE FUTURE WHICH MEANS TO SWEEP THE WHOLE PRECIOUS WORLD UTTERLY AWAY FROM HIS SIGHT BY THE SIMPLE AND APPALLING ACT OF TAKING HIS LIFE JIM
196-122150-0006 DISABLED BY A FALLING SPAR AT THE BEGINNING OF A WEEK OF WHICH HIS SCOTTISH CAPTAIN USED TO SAY AFTERWARDS MAN IT'S A PAIRFECT MEERACLE TO ME HOW SHE LIVED THROUGH IT SPENT MANY DAYS STRETCHED ON HIS BACK DAZED BATTERED HOPELESS
196-122150-0007 AND TORMENTED AS IF AT THE BOTTOM OF AN ABYSS OF UNREST HE DID NOT CARE WHAT THE END WOULD BE AND IN HIS LUCID MOMENTS OVERVALUED HIS INDIFFERENCE THE DANGER WHEN NOT SEEN HAS THE IMPERFECT VAGUENESS OF HUMAN THOUGHT
196-122150-0008 HE LAY THERE BATTENED DOWN IN THE MIDST OF A SMALL DEVASTATION AND FELT SECRETLY GLAD HE HAD NOT TO GO ON DECK BUT NOW AND AGAIN AN UNCONTROLLABLE RUSH OF ANGUISH WOULD GRIP HIM BODILY
196-122150-0009 AND THEN THE UNINTELLIGENT BRUTALITY OF AN EXISTENCE LIABLE TO THE AGONY OF SUCH SENSATIONS FILLED HIM WITH A DESPAIRING DESIRE TO ESCAPE AT ANY COST THEN FINE WEATHER RETURNED AND HE THOUGHT NO MORE ABOUT IT
196-122150-0010 HIS LAMENESS HOWEVER PERSISTED AND WHEN THE SHIP ARRIVED AT AN EASTERN PORT HE HAD TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL HIS RECOVERY WAS SLOW AND HE WAS LEFT BEHIND
196-122150-0011 AFFLICTED BY SOME MYSTERIOUS TROPICAL DISEASE WHO HELD THE DOCTOR FOR AN ASS AND INDULGED IN SECRET DEBAUCHERIES OF PATENT MEDICINE WHICH HIS TAMIL SERVANT USED TO SMUGGLE IN WITH UNWEARIED DEVOTION THEY TOLD EACH OTHER THE STORY OF THEIR LIVES
196-122150-0012 PLAYED CARDS A LITTLE OR YAWNING AND IN PYJAMAS LOUNGED THROUGH THE DAY IN EASY CHAIRS WITHOUT SAYING A WORD THE HOSPITAL STOOD ON A HILL AND A GENTLE BREEZE ENTERING THROUGH THE WINDOWS ALWAYS FLUNG WIDE OPEN
196-122150-0013 BROUGHT INTO THE BARE ROOM THE SOFTNESS OF THE SKY THE LANGUOR OF THE EARTH THE BEWITCHING BREATH OF THE EASTERN WATERS THERE WERE PERFUMES IN IT SUGGESTIONS OF INFINITE REPOSE THE GIFT OF ENDLESS DREAMS
196-122150-0014 JIM LOOKED EVERY DAY OVER THE THICKETS OF GARDENS BEYOND THE ROOFS OF THE TOWN OVER THE FRONDS OF PALMS GROWING ON THE SHORE AT THAT ROADSTEAD WHICH IS A THOROUGHFARE TO THE EAST AT THE ROADSTEAD DOTTED BY GARLANDED ISLETS
196-122150-0015 LIGHTED BY FESTAL SUNSHINE ITS SHIPS LIKE TOYS ITS BRILLIANT ACTIVITY RESEMBLING A HOLIDAY PAGEANT WITH THE ETERNAL SERENITY OF THE EASTERN SKY OVERHEAD AND THE SMILING PEACE OF THE EASTERN SEAS
196-122150-0016 HE ASSOCIATED NATURALLY WITH THE MEN OF HIS CALLING IN THE PORT THESE WERE OF TWO KINDS SOME VERY FEW AND SEEN THERE BUT SELDOM LED MYSTERIOUS LIVES
196-122150-0017 HAD PRESERVED AN UNDEFACED ENERGY WITH THE TEMPER OF BUCCANEERS AND THE EYES OF DREAMERS THEY APPEARED TO LIVE IN A CRAZY MAZE OF PLANS HOPES DANGERS ENTERPRISES AHEAD OF CIVILISATION IN THE DARK PLACES OF THE SEA
196-122150-0018 HAD REMAINED AS OFFICERS OF COUNTRY SHIPS THEY HAD NOW A HORROR OF THE HOME SERVICE WITH ITS HARDER CONDITIONS SEVERER VIEW OF DUTY AND THE HAZARD OF STORMY OCEANS THEY WERE ATTUNED TO THE ETERNAL PEACE OF EASTERN SKY AND SEA
196-122150-0019 HOW THIS ONE HAD AN EASY BILLET IN JAPAN SOMEWHERE AND THAT ONE WAS DOING WELL IN THE SIAMESE NAVY AND IN ALL THEY SAID IN THEIR ACTIONS IN THEIR LOOKS IN THEIR PERSONS COULD BE DETECTED THE SOFT SPOT THE PLACE OF DECAY
196-122150-0020 THE DETERMINATION TO LOUNGE SAFELY THROUGH EXISTENCE TO JIM THAT GOSSIPING CROWD VIEWED AS SEAMEN SEEMED AT FIRST MORE UNSUBSTANTIAL THAN SO MANY SHADOWS BUT AT LENGTH HE FOUND A FASCINATION IN THE SIGHT OF THOSE MEN
196-122150-0021 IN THEIR APPEARANCE OF DOING SO WELL ON SUCH A SMALL ALLOWANCE OF DANGER AND TOIL IN TIME BESIDE THE ORIGINAL DISDAIN THERE GREW UP SLOWLY ANOTHER SENTIMENT AND SUDDENLY GIVING UP THE IDEA OF GOING HOME
196-122150-0022 SHE WAS OWNED BY A CHINAMAN CHARTERED BY AN ARAB AND COMMANDED BY A SORT OF RENEGADE NEW SOUTH WALES GERMAN VERY ANXIOUS TO CURSE PUBLICLY HIS NATIVE COUNTRY BUT WHO APPARENTLY ON THE STRENGTH OF BISMARCK'S VICTORIOUS POLICY
196-122150-0023 BRUTALISED ALL THOSE HE WAS NOT AFRAID OF AND WORE A BLOOD AND IRON AIR COMBINED WITH A PURPLE NOSE AND A RED MOUSTACHE AFTER SHE HAD BEEN PAINTED OUTSIDE AND WHITEWASHED INSIDE EIGHT HUNDRED PILGRIMS MORE OR LESS
196-122150-0024 THEY STREAMED ABOARD OVER THREE GANGWAYS THEY STREAMED IN URGED BY FAITH AND THE HOPE OF PARADISE THEY STREAMED IN WITH A CONTINUOUS TRAMP AND SHUFFLE OF BARE FEET WITHOUT A WORD A MURMUR OR A LOOK BACK
196-122150-0025 AND WHEN CLEAR OF CONFINING RAILS SPREAD ON ALL SIDES OVER THE DECK FLOWED FORWARD AND AFT OVERFLOWED DOWN THE YAWNING HATCHWAYS FILLED THE INNER RECESSES OF THE SHIP LIKE WATER FILLING A CISTERN
196-122150-0026 LIKE WATER FLOWING INTO CREVICES AND CRANNIES LIKE WATER RISING SILENTLY EVEN WITH THE RIM EIGHT HUNDRED MEN AND WOMEN WITH FAITH AND HOPES WITH AFFECTIONS AND MEMORIES THEY HAD COLLECTED THERE
196-122150-0027 COMING FROM NORTH AND SOUTH AND FROM THE OUTSKIRTS OF THE EAST AFTER TREADING THE JUNGLE PATHS DESCENDING THE RIVERS COASTING IN PRAUS ALONG THE SHALLOWS CROSSING IN SMALL CANOES FROM ISLAND TO ISLAND PASSING THROUGH SUFFERING
196-122150-0028 MEETING STRANGE SIGHTS BESET BY STRANGE FEARS UPHELD BY ONE DESIRE THEY CAME FROM SOLITARY HUTS IN THE WILDERNESS FROM POPULOUS CAMPONGS FROM VILLAGES BY THE SEA AT THE CALL OF AN IDEA
196-122150-0029 THEY HAD LEFT THEIR FORESTS THEIR CLEARINGS THE PROTECTION OF THEIR RULERS THEIR PROSPERITY THEIR POVERTY THE SURROUNDINGS OF THEIR YOUTH AND THE GRAVES OF THEIR FATHERS THEY CAME COVERED WITH DUST WITH SWEAT WITH GRIME WITH RAGS
196-122150-0030 THE STRONG MEN AT THE HEAD OF FAMILY PARTIES THE LEAN OLD MEN PRESSING FORWARD WITHOUT HOPE OF RETURN YOUNG BOYS WITH FEARLESS EYES GLANCING CURIOUSLY SHY LITTLE GIRLS WITH TUMBLED LONG HAIR
196-122150-0031 THE TIMID WOMEN MUFFLED UP AND CLASPING TO THEIR BREASTS WRAPPED IN LOOSE ENDS OF SOILED HEAD CLOTHS THEIR SLEEPING BABIES THE UNCONSCIOUS PILGRIMS OF AN EXACTING BELIEF
196-122150-0032 SAID THE GERMAN SKIPPER TO HIS NEW CHIEF MATE AN ARAB THE LEADER OF THAT PIOUS VOYAGE CAME LAST HE WALKED SLOWLY ABOARD HANDSOME AND GRAVE IN HIS WHITE GOWN AND LARGE TURBAN A STRING OF SERVANTS FOLLOWED LOADED WITH HIS LUGGAGE
196-122150-0033 AND ON THE SECRET PURPOSES OF THEIR HEARTS THE STEAMER POUNDED IN THE DUSK THE CALM WATER OF THE STRAIT AND FAR ASTERN OF THE PILGRIM SHIP A SCREW PILE LIGHTHOUSE PLANTED BY UNBELIEVERS ON A TREACHEROUS SHOAL SEEMED TO WINK AT HER
196-122150-0034 ITS EYE OF FLAME AS IF IN DERISION OF HER ERRAND OF FAITH SHE CLEARED THE STRAIT CROSSED THE BAY CONTINUED ON HER WAY THROUGH THE ONE DEGREE PASSAGE SHE HELD ON STRAIGHT FOR THE RED SEA UNDER A SERENE SKY
196-122150-0035 ENVELOPED IN A FULGOR OF SUNSHINE THAT KILLED ALL THOUGHT OPPRESSED THE HEART WITHERED ALL IMPULSES OF STRENGTH AND ENERGY AND UNDER THE SINISTER SPLENDOUR OF THAT SKY THE SEA BLUE AND PROFOUND REMAINED STILL WITHOUT A STIR
196-122150-0036 WITHOUT A RIPPLE WITHOUT A WRINKLE VISCOUS STAGNANT DEAD THE PATNA WITH A SLIGHT HISS PASSED OVER THAT PLAIN LUMINOUS AND SMOOTH UNROLLED A BLACK RIBBON OF SMOKE ACROSS THE SKY
196-122150-0037 GLIDED PAST ON HIS DESCENT AND SANK MYSTERIOUSLY INTO THE SEA EVENING AFTER EVENING PRESERVING THE SAME DISTANCE AHEAD OF HER ADVANCING BOWS THE FIVE WHITES ON BOARD LIVED AMIDSHIPS ISOLATED FROM THE HUMAN CARGO
196-122150-0038 THE AWNINGS COVERED THE DECK WITH A WHITE ROOF FROM STEM TO STERN AND A FAINT HUM A LOW MURMUR OF SAD VOICES ALONE REVEALED THE PRESENCE OF A CROWD OF PEOPLE UPON THE GREAT BLAZE OF THE OCEAN
196-122150-0039 SUCH WERE THE DAYS STILL HOT HEAVY DISAPPEARING ONE BY ONE INTO THE PAST AS IF FALLING INTO AN ABYSS FOR EVER OPEN IN THE WAKE OF THE SHIP AND THE SHIP LONELY UNDER A WISP OF SMOKE
196-122150-0040 HELD ON HER STEADFAST WAY BLACK AND SMOULDERING IN A LUMINOUS IMMENSITY AS IF SCORCHED BY A FLAME FLICKED AT HER FROM A HEAVEN WITHOUT PITY
196-122152-0000 HE SAID SPEAKING OF THE SHIP SHE WENT OVER WHATEVER IT WAS AS EASY AS A SNAKE CRAWLING OVER A STICK THE ILLUSTRATION WAS GOOD THE QUESTIONS WERE AIMING AT FACTS
196-122152-0001 AND THE OFFICIAL INQUIRY WAS BEING HELD IN THE POLICE COURT OF AN EASTERN PORT HE STOOD ELEVATED IN THE WITNESS BOX WITH BURNING CHEEKS IN A COOL LOFTY ROOM
196-122152-0002 THE BIG FRAMEWORK OF PUNKAHS MOVED GENTLY TO AND FRO HIGH ABOVE HIS HEAD AND FROM BELOW MANY EYES WERE LOOKING AT HIM OUT OF DARK FACES OUT OF WHITE FACES OUT OF RED FACES OUT OF FACES ATTENTIVE SPELLBOUND
196-122152-0003 AS IF ALL THESE PEOPLE SITTING IN ORDERLY ROWS UPON NARROW BENCHES HAD BEEN ENSLAVED BY THE FASCINATION OF HIS VOICE IT WAS VERY LOUD IT RANG STARTLING IN HIS OWN EARS IT WAS THE ONLY SOUND AUDIBLE IN THE WORLD
196-122152-0004 FOR THE TERRIBLY DISTINCT QUESTIONS THAT EXTORTED HIS ANSWERS SEEMED TO SHAPE THEMSELVES IN ANGUISH AND PAIN WITHIN HIS BREAST CAME TO HIM POIGNANT AND SILENT
196-122152-0005 OUTSIDE THE COURT THE SUN BLAZED WITHIN WAS THE WIND OF GREAT PUNKAHS THAT MADE YOU SHIVER THE SHAME THAT MADE YOU BURN THE ATTENTIVE EYES WHOSE GLANCE STABBED THE FACE OF THE PRESIDING MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0006 CLEAN SHAVED AND IMPASSIBLE LOOKED AT HIM DEADLY PALE BETWEEN THE RED FACES OF THE TWO NAUTICAL ASSESSORS THE LIGHT OF A BROAD WINDOW UNDER THE CEILING FELL FROM ABOVE ON THE HEADS AND SHOULDERS OF THE THREE MEN
196-122152-0007 AS IF FACTS COULD EXPLAIN ANYTHING AFTER YOU HAD CONCLUDED YOU HAD COLLIDED WITH SOMETHING FLOATING AWASH SAY A WATER LOGGED WRECK YOU WERE ORDERED BY YOUR CAPTAIN TO GO FORWARD AND ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY DAMAGE DONE
196-122152-0008 LOOKING AT JIM WITH THOUGHTFUL BLUE EYES THE OTHER A HEAVY SCORNFUL MAN THROWN BACK IN HIS SEAT HIS LEFT ARM EXTENDED FULL LENGTH DRUMMED DELICATELY WITH HIS FINGER TIPS ON A BLOTTING PAD IN THE MIDDLE THE MAGISTRATE
196-122152-0009 I WAS TOLD TO CALL NO ONE AND TO MAKE NO NOISE FOR FEAR OF CREATING A PANIC I THOUGHT THE PRECAUTION REASONABLE I TOOK ONE OF THE LAMPS THAT WERE HUNG UNDER THE AWNINGS AND WENT FORWARD AFTER OPENING THE FOREPEAK HATCH I HEARD SPLASHING IN THERE
196-122152-0010 HIS FINGERS PLAYED INCESSANTLY TOUCHING THE PAPER WITHOUT NOISE I DID NOT THINK OF DANGER JUST THEN I MIGHT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE STARTLED ALL THIS HAPPENED IN SUCH A QUIET WAY AND SO VERY SUDDENLY
196-122152-0011 I KNEW THERE WAS NO OTHER BULKHEAD IN THE SHIP BUT THE COLLISION BULKHEAD SEPARATING THE FOREPEAK FROM THE FOREHOLD I WENT BACK TO TELL THE CAPTAIN I CAME UPON THE SECOND ENGINEER GETTING UP AT THE FOOT OF THE BRIDGE LADDER HE SEEMED DAZED AND
196-122152-0012 TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HIS LEFT ARM WAS BROKEN HE HAD SLIPPED ON THE TOP STEP WHEN GETTING DOWN WHILE I WAS FORWARD HE EXCLAIMED MY GOD THAT ROTTEN BULKHEAD'LL GIVE WAY IN A MINUTE
196-122152-0013 HE DID NOT STRIKE HIM AGAIN HE STOOD BENDING OVER HIM AND SPEAKING ANGRILY BUT QUITE LOW
196-122152-0014 STOP THE ENGINES INSTEAD OF MAKING A ROW ABOUT IT ON DECK I HEARD HIM SAY GET UP RUN FLY HE SWORE ALSO THE ENGINEER SLID DOWN THE STARBOARD LADDER AND BOLTED ROUND THE SKYLIGHT TO THE ENGINE ROOM COMPANION
196-122152-0015 WHICH WAS ON THE PORT SIDE HE MOANED AS HE RAN HE SPOKE SLOWLY HE REMEMBERED SWIFTLY AND WITH EXTREME VIVIDNESS HE COULD HAVE REPRODUCED LIKE AN ECHO THE MOANING OF THE ENGINEER FOR THE BETTER INFORMATION OF THESE MEN
196-122152-0016 WHO WANTED FACTS AFTER HIS FIRST FEELING OF REVOLT HE HAD COME ROUND TO THE VIEW THAT ONLY A METICULOUS PRECISION OF STATEMENT WOULD BRING OUT THE TRUE HORROR BEHIND THE APPALLING FACE OF THINGS
196-122152-0017 THE FACTS THOSE MEN WERE SO EAGER TO KNOW HAD BEEN VISIBLE TANGIBLE OPEN TO THE SENSES OCCUPYING THEIR PLACE IN SPACE AND TIME REQUIRING FOR THEIR EXISTENCE A FOURTEEN HUNDRED TON STEAMER
196-122152-0018 PERDITION THAT DWELT WITHIN LIKE A MALEVOLENT SOUL IN A DETESTABLE BODY HE WAS ANXIOUS TO MAKE THIS CLEAR THIS HAD NOT BEEN A COMMON AFFAIR EVERYTHING IN IT HAD BEEN OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE
196-122152-0019 AND FORTUNATELY HE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO GO ON TALKING FOR TRUTH'S SAKE PERHAPS FOR HIS OWN SAKE ALSO AND WHILE HIS UTTERANCE WAS DELIBERATE HIS MIND POSITIVELY FLEW ROUND AND ROUND THE SERRIED CIRCLE OF FACTS
196-122152-0020 HE SEEMED CALM ENOUGH ONLY HE STUMBLED SEVERAL TIMES AND ONCE AS I STOOD SPEAKING TO HIM HE WALKED RIGHT INTO ME AS THOUGH HE HAD BEEN STONE BLIND HE MADE NO DEFINITE ANSWER TO WHAT I HAD TO TELL
196-122152-0021 FELT A SHIVER RUN DOWN HIS BACK THE BIG ASSESSOR HAD DROPPED HIS EYELIDS AND DRUMMED ON WITHOUT A SOUND CARELESS AND MOURNFUL THE EYES OF THE OTHER ABOVE THE SUNBURNT CLASPED FINGERS
196-122152-0022 THE MAGISTRATE HAD SWAYED FORWARD
196-122152-0023 HE RESTED HIS TEMPLE IN THE PALM OF HIS HAND THE WIND OF THE PUNKAHS EDDIED DOWN ON THE HEADS ON THE DARK FACED NATIVES WOUND ABOUT IN VOLUMINOUS DRAPERIES ON THE EUROPEANS SITTING TOGETHER VERY HOT
196-122152-0024 AND IN DRILL SUITS THAT SEEMED TO FIT THEM AS CLOSE AS THEIR SKINS AND HOLDING THEIR ROUND PITH HATS ON THEIR KNEES WHILE GLIDING ALONG THE WALLS THE COURT PEONS BUTTONED TIGHT IN LONG WHITE COATS FLITTED RAPIDLY TO AND FRO
196-122152-0025 RESTED UPON A WHITE MAN WHO SAT APART FROM THE OTHERS WITH HIS FACE WORN AND CLOUDED BUT WITH QUIET EYES THAT GLANCED STRAIGHT INTERESTED AND CLEAR JIM ANSWERED ANOTHER QUESTION AND WAS TEMPTED TO CRY OUT
196-122152-0026 WHAT'S THE GOOD OF THIS WHAT'S THE GOOD HE TAPPED WITH HIS FOOT SLIGHTLY BIT HIS LIP AND LOOKED AWAY OVER THE HEADS HE MET THE EYES OF THE WHITE MAN THE GLANCE DIRECTED AT HIM WAS NOT THE FASCINATED STARE OF THE OTHERS
196-122152-0027 IT WAS AN ACT OF INTELLIGENT VOLITION JIM BETWEEN TWO QUESTIONS FORGOT HIMSELF SO FAR AS TO FIND LEISURE FOR A THOUGHT THIS FELLOW RAN THE THOUGHT LOOKS AT ME AS THOUGH HE COULD SEE SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING PAST MY SHOULDER
196-122152-0028 HE HAD COME ACROSS THAT MAN BEFORE IN THE STREET PERHAPS HE WAS POSITIVE HE HAD NEVER SPOKEN TO HIM FOR DAYS FOR MANY DAYS HE HAD SPOKEN TO NO ONE BUT HAD HELD SILENT INCOHERENT AND ENDLESS CONVERSE WITH HIMSELF
196-122152-0029 LIKE A PRISONER ALONE IN HIS CELL OR LIKE A WAYFARER LOST IN A WILDERNESS AT PRESENT HE WAS ANSWERING QUESTIONS THAT DID NOT MATTER THOUGH THEY HAD A PURPOSE BUT HE DOUBTED WHETHER HE WOULD EVER AGAIN SPEAK OUT AS LONG AS HE LIVED
196-122152-0030 THE SOUND OF HIS OWN TRUTHFUL STATEMENTS CONFIRMED HIS DELIBERATE OPINION THAT SPEECH WAS OF NO USE TO HIM ANY LONGER THAT MAN THERE SEEMED TO BE AWARE OF HIS HOPELESS DIFFICULTY JIM LOOKED AT HIM THEN TURNED AWAY
196-122152-0031 AND AUDIBLY PERHAPS IT WOULD BE AFTER DINNER ON A VERANDAH DRAPED IN MOTIONLESS FOLIAGE AND CROWNED WITH FLOWERS IN THE DEEP DUSK SPECKLED BY FIERY CIGAR ENDS THE ELONGATED BULK OF EACH CANE CHAIR
196-122152-0032 HARBOURED A SILENT LISTENER NOW AND THEN A SMALL RED GLOW WOULD MOVE ABRUPTLY AND EXPANDING LIGHT UP THE FINGERS OF A LANGUID HAND PART OF A FACE IN PROFOUND REPOSE OR FLASH A CRIMSON GLEAM INTO A PAIR OF PENSIVE EYES
196-122152-0033 OVERSHADOWED BY A FRAGMENT OF AN UNRUFFLED FOREHEAD AND WITH THE VERY FIRST WORD UTTERED MARLOW'S BODY EXTENDED AT REST IN THE SEAT WOULD BECOME VERY STILL AS THOUGH HIS SPIRIT HAD WINGED ITS WAY BACK INTO THE LAPSE OF TIME
196-122159-0000 AT HIS BACK WAS THE DARK NIGHT WITH THE CLEAR STARS WHOSE DISTANT GLITTER DISPOSED IN RETREATING PLANES LURED THE EYE INTO THE DEPTHS OF A GREATER DARKNESS
196-122159-0001 AND YET A MYSTERIOUS LIGHT SEEMED TO SHOW ME HIS BOYISH HEAD AS IF IN THAT MOMENT THE YOUTH WITHIN HIM HAD FOR A MOMENT GLOWED AND EXPIRED YOU ARE AN AWFUL GOOD SORT TO LISTEN
196-122159-0002 LIKE THIS HE SAID IT DOES ME GOOD YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS TO ME YOU DON'T WORDS SEEMED TO FAIL HIM IT WAS A DISTINCT GLIMPSE HE WAS A YOUNGSTER OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO SEE ABOUT YOU
196-122159-0003 OF THE SORT YOU LIKE TO IMAGINE YOURSELF TO HAVE BEEN OF THE SORT WHOSE APPEARANCE CLAIMS THE FELLOWSHIP OF THESE ILLUSIONS YOU HAD THOUGHT GONE OUT EXTINCT COLD AND WHICH AS IF REKINDLED AT THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER FLAME
196-122159-0004 YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR A FELLOW IN MY POSITION TO BE BELIEVED MAKE A CLEAN BREAST OF IT TO AN ELDER MAN IT IS SO DIFFICULT SO AWFULLY UNFAIR SO HARD TO UNDERSTAND
196-122159-0005 THE MISTS WERE CLOSING AGAIN I DON'T KNOW HOW OLD I APPEARED TO HIM AND HOW MUCH WISE NOT HALF AS OLD AS I FELT JUST THEN NOT HALF AS USELESSLY WISE AS I KNEW MYSELF TO BE
196-122159-0006 SURELY IN NO OTHER CRAFT AS IN THAT OF THE SEA DO THE HEARTS OF THOSE ALREADY LAUNCHED TO SINK OR SWIM GO OUT SO MUCH TO THE YOUTH ON THE BRINK LOOKING WITH SHINING EYES UPON THAT
196-122159-0007 GLITTER OF THE VAST SURFACE WHICH IS ONLY A REFLECTION OF HIS OWN GLANCES FULL OF FIRE THERE IS SUCH MAGNIFICENT VAGUENESS IN THE EXPECTATIONS THAT HAD DRIVEN EACH OF US TO SEA SUCH A GLORIOUS INDEFINITENESS
196-122159-0008 SUCH A BEAUTIFUL GREED OF ADVENTURES THAT ARE THEIR OWN AND ONLY REWARD WHAT WE GET WELL WE WON'T TALK OF THAT BUT CAN ONE OF US RESTRAIN A SMILE
196-122159-0009 IN NO OTHER KIND OF LIFE IS THE ILLUSION MORE WIDE OF REALITY IN NO OTHER IS THE BEGINNING ALL ILLUSION THE DISENCHANTMENT MORE SWIFT THE SUBJUGATION MORE COMPLETE
196-122159-0010 HADN'T WE ALL COMMENCED WITH THE SAME DESIRE ENDED WITH THE SAME KNOWLEDGE CARRIED THE MEMORY OF THE SAME CHERISHED GLAMOUR THROUGH THE SORDID DAYS OF IMPRECATION WHAT WONDER THAT WHEN SOME
196-122159-0011 HEAVY PROD GETS HOME THE BOND IS FOUND TO BE CLOSE THAT BESIDES THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CRAFT THERE IS FELT THE STRENGTH OF A WIDER FEELING THE FEELING THAT BINDS A MAN TO A CHILD HE WAS THERE BEFORE ME BELIEVING THAT
196-122159-0012 AND HE HAD BEEN DELIBERATING UPON DEATH CONFOUND HIM HE HAD FOUND THAT TO MEDITATE ABOUT BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE HAD SAVED HIS LIFE WHILE ALL ITS GLAMOUR HAD GONE WITH THE SHIP IN THE NIGHT WHAT MORE NATURAL
196-122159-0013 AND HIS VOICE SPOKE I WAS SO LOST YOU KNOW IT WAS THE SORT OF THING ONE DOES NOT EXPECT TO HAPPEN TO ONE IT WAS NOT LIKE A FIGHT FOR INSTANCE
196-122159-0014 HE APPEARED CHANGED AS IF HE HAD SUDDENLY MATURED ONE COULDN'T BE SURE HE MUTTERED AH YOU WERE NOT SURE I SAID
196-122159-0015 AND WAS PLACATED BY THE SOUND OF A FAINT SIGH THAT PASSED BETWEEN US LIKE THE FLIGHT OF A BIRD IN THE NIGHT WELL I WASN'T HE SAID COURAGEOUSLY IT WAS SOMETHING LIKE THAT WRETCHED STORY THEY MADE UP IT WAS NOT A LIE
196-122159-0016 BUT IT WASN'T TRUTH ALL THE SAME IT WAS SOMETHING ONE KNOWS A DOWNRIGHT LIE THERE WAS NOT THE THICKNESS OF A SHEET OF PAPER BETWEEN THE RIGHT AND THE WRONG OF THIS AFFAIR
196-122159-0017 HOW MUCH MORE DID YOU WANT I ASKED BUT I THINK I SPOKE SO LOW THAT HE DID NOT CATCH WHAT I SAID HE HAD ADVANCED HIS ARGUMENT AS THOUGH LIFE HAD BEEN A NETWORK OF
196-122159-0018 HIS VOICE SOUNDED REASONABLE SUPPOSE I HAD NOT I MEAN TO SAY SUPPOSE I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP WELL HOW MUCH LONGER SAY A MINUTE HALF A MINUTE
196-122159-0019 I INTERJECTED I WOULD HAVE MEANT TO BE HE RETORTED AND THAT'S MORE THAN I MEANT WHEN I HE SHIVERED AS IF ABOUT TO SWALLOW SOME NAUSEOUS DRUG JUMPED
196-122159-0020 HE PRONOUNCED WITH A CONVULSIVE EFFORT WHOSE STRESS AS IF PROPAGATED BY THE WAVES OF THE AIR MADE MY BODY STIR A LITTLE IN THE CHAIR HE FIXED ME WITH LOWERING EYES DON'T YOU BELIEVE ME HE CRIED I SWEAR
196-122159-0021 I OUGHT TO HAVE KNOWN I AM I AM A GENTLEMAN TOO YES YES I SAID HASTILY HE WAS LOOKING ME SQUARELY IN THE FACE AND WITHDREW HIS GAZE SLOWLY
196-122159-0022 NOW YOU UNDERSTAND WHY I DIDN'T AFTER ALL DIDN'T GO OUT IN THAT WAY I WASN'T GOING TO BE FRIGHTENED AT WHAT I HAD DONE AND ANYHOW IF I HAD STUCK TO THE SHIP I WOULD HAVE DONE MY BEST TO BE SAVED
196-122159-0023 MEN HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO FLOAT FOR HOURS IN THE OPEN SEA AND BE PICKED UP NOT MUCH THE WORSE FOR IT I MIGHT HAVE LASTED IT OUT BETTER THAN MANY OTHERS THERE'S NOTHING THE MATTER WITH MY HEART
196-122159-0024 A HAIR'S BREADTH HE MUTTERED NOT THE BREADTH OF A HAIR BETWEEN THIS AND THAT AND AT THE TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE A HAIR AT MIDNIGHT I PUT IN
196-122159-0025 A LITTLE VICIOUSLY I FEAR DON'T YOU SEE WHAT I MEAN BY THE SOLIDARITY OF THE CRAFT I WAS AGGRIEVED AGAINST HIM AS THOUGH HE HAD CHEATED ME
196-122159-0026 KEEP UP THE ILLUSION OF MY BEGINNINGS AS THOUGH HE HAD ROBBED OUR COMMON LIFE OF THE LAST SPARK OF ITS GLAMOUR AND SO YOU CLEARED OUT AT ONCE JUMPED HE CORRECTED ME INCISIVELY JUMPED MIND
196-122159-0027 HE REPEATED AND I WONDERED AT THE EVIDENT BUT OBSCURE INTENTION WELL YES PERHAPS I COULD NOT SEE THEN BUT I HAD PLENTY OF TIME AND ANY AMOUNT OF LIGHT IN THAT BOAT AND I COULD THINK TOO
196-122159-0028 NOBODY WOULD KNOW OF COURSE BUT THIS DID NOT MAKE IT ANY EASIER FOR ME YOU'VE GOT TO BELIEVE THAT TOO I DID NOT WANT ALL THIS TALK NO YES I WON'T LIE
196-122159-0029 I WANTED IT IT IS THE VERY THING I WANTED THERE DO YOU THINK YOU OR ANYBODY COULD HAVE MADE ME IF I I AM I AM NOT AFRAID TO TELL AND I WASN'T AFRAID TO THINK EITHER I LOOKED IT IN THE FACE
196-122159-0030 I WASN'T GOING TO RUN AWAY AT FIRST AT NIGHT IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR THOSE FELLOWS I MIGHT HAVE NO BY HEAVENS I WAS NOT GOING TO GIVE THEM THAT SATISFACTION THEY HAD DONE ENOUGH THEY MADE UP A STORY AND BELIEVED IT FOR ALL I KNOW
196-122159-0031 BUT I KNEW THE TRUTH AND I WOULD LIVE IT DOWN ALONE WITH MYSELF I WASN'T GOING TO GIVE IN TO SUCH A BEASTLY UNFAIR THING WHAT DID IT PROVE AFTER ALL I WAS CONFOUNDEDLY CUT UP SICK OF LIFE
196-122159-0032 NO THE PROPER THING WAS TO FACE IT OUT ALONE FOR MYSELF WAIT FOR ANOTHER CHANCE
1963-142393-0000 ADAM UNDERSTOOD DINAH'S HASTE TO GO AWAY AND DREW HOPE RATHER THAN DISCOURAGEMENT FROM IT
1963-142393-0001 I WISH I'D ASKED HER TO WRITE TO ME THOUGH HE THOUGHT AND YET
1963-142393-0002 SHE WANTS TO BE QUITE QUIET IN HER OLD WAY FOR A WHILE AND I'VE NO RIGHT TO BE IMPATIENT AND INTERRUPTING HER WITH MY WISHES SHE'S TOLD ME WHAT HER MIND IS AND SHE'S NOT A WOMAN TO SAY ONE THING AND MEAN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0003 I'LL WAIT PATIENTLY THAT WAS ADAM'S WISE RESOLUTION AND IT THROVE EXCELLENTLY FOR THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WEEKS ON THE NOURISHMENT IT GOT
1963-142393-0004 BUT TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER THE RESOLUTION BEGAN TO DWINDLE PERCEPTIBLY AND SHOWED DANGEROUS SYMPTOMS OF EXHAUSTION THE WEEKS WERE UNUSUALLY LONG DINAH MUST SURELY HAVE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH TIME TO MAKE UP HER MIND
1963-142393-0005 HE IS A LITTLE TOO FLUSHED AND EXALTED WITH THAT FIRST DRAUGHT SHE OFFERS HIM TO CARE MUCH ABOUT THE TASTE OF THE SECOND HE TREADS THE EARTH WITH A VERY ELASTIC STEP AS HE WALKS AWAY FROM HER AND MAKES LIGHT OF ALL DIFFICULTIES
1963-142393-0006 BUT THAT SORT OF GLOW DIES OUT MEMORY GETS SADLY DILUTED WITH TIME AND IS NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO REVIVE US ADAM WAS NO LONGER SO CONFIDENT AS HE HAD BEEN HE BEGAN TO FEAR THAT PERHAPS DINAH'S OLD LIFE
1963-142393-0007 WOULD HAVE TOO STRONG A GRASP UPON HER
1963-142393-0008 IF SHE HAD NOT FELT THIS SHE WOULD SURELY HAVE WRITTEN TO HIM TO GIVE HIM SOME COMFORT BUT IT APPEARED THAT SHE HELD IT RIGHT TO DISCOURAGE HIM AS ADAM'S CONFIDENCE WANED HIS PATIENCE WANED WITH IT
1963-142393-0009 AND HE THOUGHT HE MUST WRITE HIMSELF HE MUST ASK DINAH NOT TO LEAVE HIM IN PAINFUL DOUBT LONGER THAN WAS NEEDFUL HE SAT UP LATE ONE NIGHT TO WRITE HER A LETTER BUT THE NEXT MORNING HE BURNT IT AFRAID OF ITS EFFECT
1963-142393-0010 IT WOULD BE WORSE TO HAVE A DISCOURAGING ANSWER BY LETTER THAN FROM HER OWN LIPS FOR HER PRESENCE RECONCILED HIM TO HER WILL YOU PERCEIVE HOW IT WAS ADAM WAS HUNGERING FOR THE SIGHT OF DINAH
1963-142393-0011 AND WHEN THAT SORT OF HUNGER REACHES A CERTAIN STAGE A LOVER IS LIKELY TO STILL IT THOUGH HE MAY HAVE TO PUT HIS FUTURE IN PAWN BUT WHAT HARM COULD HE DO BY GOING TO SNOWFIELD DINAH COULD NOT BE DISPLEASED WITH HIM FOR IT
1963-142393-0012 SHE HAD NOT FORBIDDEN HIM TO GO SHE MUST SURELY EXPECT THAT HE WOULD GO BEFORE LONG BY THE SECOND SUNDAY IN OCTOBER
1963-142393-0013 THAT HE WAS ALREADY ON HIS WAY TO SNOWFIELD ON HORSEBACK THIS TIME FOR HIS HOURS WERE PRECIOUS NOW AND HE HAD BORROWED JONATHAN BURGE'S GOOD NAG FOR THE JOURNEY WHAT KEEN MEMORIES WENT ALONG THE ROAD WITH HIM
1963-142393-0014 HE HAD OFTEN BEEN TO OAKBOURNE AND BACK SINCE THAT FIRST JOURNEY TO SNOWFIELD BUT BEYOND OAKBOURNE THE GREYSTONE WALLS THE BROKEN COUNTRY THE MEAGRE TREES SEEMED TO BE TELLING HIM AFRESH
1963-142393-0015 THE STORY OF THAT PAINFUL PAST WHICH HE KNEW SO WELL BY HEART BUT NO STORY IS THE SAME TO US AFTER A LAPSE OF TIME OR RATHER WE WHO READ IT ARE NO LONGER THE SAME INTERPRETERS AND ADAM
1963-142393-0016 THIS MORNING BROUGHT WITH HIM NEW THOUGHTS THROUGH THAT GREY COUNTRY THOUGHTS WHICH GAVE AN ALTERED SIGNIFICANCE TO ITS STORY OF THE PAST THAT IS A BASE
1963-142393-0017 AND SELFISH EVEN A BLASPHEMOUS SPIRIT WHICH REJOICES AND IS THANKFUL OVER THE PAST EVIL THAT HAS BLIGHTED OR CRUSHED ANOTHER BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN MADE A SOURCE OF UNFORESEEN GOOD TO OURSELVES
1963-142393-0018 ADAM COULD NEVER CEASE TO MOURN OVER THAT MYSTERY OF HUMAN SORROW WHICH HAD BEEN BROUGHT SO CLOSE TO HIM HE COULD NEVER THANK GOD FOR ANOTHER'S MISERY AND IF I WERE CAPABLE OF THAT NARROW SIGHTED JOY IN ADAM'S BEHALF
1963-142393-0019 I SHOULD STILL KNOW HE WAS NOT THE MAN TO FEEL IT FOR HIMSELF HE WOULD HAVE SHAKEN HIS HEAD AT SUCH A SENTIMENT AND SAID EVIL'S EVIL AND SORROW'S SORROW
1963-142393-0020 BY WRAPPING IT UP IN OTHER WORDS OTHER FOLKS WERE NOT CREATED FOR MY SAKE THAT I SHOULD THINK ALL SQUARE WHEN THINGS TURN OUT WELL FOR ME BUT IT IS NOT IGNOBLE TO FEEL THAT THE FULLER LIFE
1963-142393-0021 WHICH A SAD EXPERIENCE HAS BROUGHT US IS WORTH OUR OWN PERSONAL SHARE OF PAIN SURELY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO FEEL OTHERWISE ANY MORE THAN IT WOULD BE POSSIBLE
1963-142393-0022 BY WHICH HIS DIM BLURRED SIGHT OF MEN AS TREES WALKING HAD BEEN EXCHANGED FOR CLEAR OUTLINE AND EFFULGENT DAY THE GROWTH OF HIGHER FEELING WITHIN US IS LIKE THE GROWTH OF FACULTY
1963-142393-0023 WE CAN NO MORE WISH TO RETURN TO A NARROWER SYMPATHY THAN A PAINTER OR A MUSICIAN CAN WISH TO RETURN TO HIS CRUDER MANNER OR A PHILOSOPHER TO HIS LESS COMPLETE FORMULA
1963-142393-0024 SOMETHING LIKE THIS SENSE OF ENLARGED BEING WAS IN ADAM'S MIND THIS SUNDAY MORNING AS HE RODE ALONG IN VIVID RECOLLECTION OF THE PAST
1963-142393-0025 THE HOPE OF PASSING HIS LIFE WITH HER HAD BEEN THE DISTANT UNSEEN POINT TOWARDS WHICH THAT HARD JOURNEY FROM SNOWFIELD EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO HAD BEEN LEADING HIM TENDER AND DEEP AS HIS LOVE FOR HETTY HAD BEEN
1963-142393-0026 SO DEEP THAT THE ROOTS OF IT WOULD NEVER BE TORN AWAY HIS LOVE FOR DINAH WAS BETTER AND MORE PRECIOUS TO HIM FOR IT WAS THE OUTGROWTH OF THAT FULLER LIFE WHICH HAD COME TO HIM FROM HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH DEEP SORROW
1963-142393-0027 IT'S LIKE AS IF IT WAS A NEW STRENGTH TO ME HE SAID TO HIMSELF TO LOVE HER AND KNOW AS SHE LOVES ME
1963-142393-0028 FOR SHE'S BETTER THAN I AM
1963-142393-0029 AS IF YOU COULD WALK MORE FEARLESS WHEN YOU'VE MORE TRUST IN ANOTHER
1963-142393-0030 I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THINKING I KNEW BETTER THAN THEM AS BELONGED TO ME
1963-142393-0031 WHEN YOU CAN'T LOOK TO THEM NEAREST TO YOU T HELP YOU WITH A BIT BETTER THOUGHT
1963-142393-0032 WHEN ADAM CAME IN SIGHT OF THE GREY TOWN ON THE HILL SIDE AND LOOKED SEARCHINGLY TOWARDS THE GREEN VALLEY BELOW FOR THE FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE OLD THATCHED ROOF NEAR THE UGLY RED MILL THE SCENE LOOKED LESS HARSH IN THE SOFT
1963-142393-0033 OCTOBER SUNSHINE THAN IT HAD IN THE EAGER TIME OF EARLY SPRING AND THE ONE GRAND CHARM IT POSSESSED IN COMMON WITH ALL WIDE STRETCHING WOODLESS REGIONS
1963-142393-0034 THAT IT FILLED YOU WITH A NEW CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE OVERARCHING SKY HAD A MILDER MORE SOOTHING INFLUENCE THAN USUAL ON THIS ALMOST CLOUDLESS DAY ADAM'S DOUBTS AND FEARS MELTED UNDER THIS INFLUENCE
1963-142393-0035 AS THE DELICATE WEBLIKE CLOUDS HAD GRADUALLY MELTED AWAY INTO THE CLEAR BLUE ABOVE HIM HE SEEMED TO SEE DINAH'S GENTLE FACE ASSURING HIM WITH ITS LOOKS ALONE OF ALL HE LONGED TO KNOW
1963-142393-0036 HE DID NOT EXPECT DINAH TO BE AT HOME AT THIS HOUR BUT HE GOT DOWN FROM HIS HORSE AND TIED IT AT THE LITTLE GATE
1963-142393-0037 HE HAD SET HIS MIND ON FOLLOWING HER AND BRINGING HER HOME SHE WAS GONE TO SLOMAN'S END A HAMLET ABOUT THREE MILES OFF OVER THE HILL THE OLD WOMAN TOLD HIM
1963-142393-0038 TO PREACH IN A COTTAGE THERE AS HER HABIT WAS
1963-142393-0039 SO ADAM GOT ON HIS HORSE AGAIN AND RODE TO THE TOWN PUTTING UP AT THE OLD INN AND TAKING A HASTY DINNER THERE IN THE COMPANY OF THE TOO CHATTY LANDLORD FROM WHOSE FRIENDLY QUESTIONS AND REMINISCENCES
1963-142393-0040 HE WAS GLAD TO ESCAPE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SET OUT TOWARDS SLOMAN'S END WITH ALL HIS HASTE IT WAS NEARLY FOUR O'CLOCK BEFORE HE COULD SET OFF
1963-142393-0041 THE LITTLE GREY DESOLATE LOOKING HAMLET UNSCREENED BY SHELTERING TREES LAY IN SIGHT LONG BEFORE HE REACHED IT AND AS HE CAME NEAR HE COULD HEAR THE SOUND OF VOICES SINGING A HYMN
1963-142393-0042 PERHAPS THAT'S THE LAST HYMN BEFORE THEY COME AWAY ADAM THOUGHT I'LL WALK BACK A BIT AND TURN AGAIN TO MEET HER FARTHER OFF THE VILLAGE HE WALKED BACK TILL HE GOT NEARLY TO THE TOP OF THE HILL AGAIN
1963-142393-0043 AND SEATED HIMSELF ON A LOOSE STONE AGAINST THE LOW WALL TO WATCH TILL HE SHOULD SEE THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE LEAVING THE HAMLET AND WINDING UP THE HILL HE CHOSE THIS SPOT ALMOST AT THE TOP OF THE HILL
1963-142393-0044 BECAUSE IT WAS AWAY FROM ALL EYES NO HOUSE NO CATTLE NOT EVEN A NIBBLING SHEEP NEAR NO PRESENCE BUT THE STILL LIGHTS AND SHADOWS AND THE GREAT EMBRACING SKY
1963-142393-0045 SHE WAS MUCH LONGER COMING THAN HE EXPECTED HE WAITED AN HOUR AT LEAST WATCHING FOR HER AND THINKING OF HER WHILE THE AFTERNOON SHADOWS LENGTHENED AND THE LIGHT GREW SOFTER AT LAST HE SAW THE LITTLE BLACK FIGURE
1963-142393-0046 COMING FROM BETWEEN THE GREY HOUSES AND GRADUALLY APPROACHING THE FOOT OF THE HILL SLOWLY ADAM THOUGHT BUT DINAH WAS REALLY WALKING AT HER USUAL PACE WITH A LIGHT QUIET STEP
1963-142393-0047 NOW SHE WAS BEGINNING TO WIND ALONG THE PATH UP THE HILL BUT ADAM WOULD NOT MOVE YET HE WOULD NOT MEET HER TOO SOON HE HAD SET HIS HEART ON MEETING HER IN THIS ASSURED LONELINESS AND NOW HE BEGAN TO FEAR
1963-142393-0048 LEST HE SHOULD STARTLE HER TOO MUCH YET HE THOUGHT SHE'S NOT ONE TO BE OVERSTARTLED SHE'S ALWAYS SO CALM AND QUIET AS IF SHE WAS PREPARED FOR ANYTHING WHAT WAS SHE THINKING OF AS SHE WOUND UP THE HILL
1963-142393-0049 PERHAPS SHE HAD FOUND COMPLETE REPOSE WITHOUT HIM AND HAD CEASED TO FEEL ANY NEED OF HIS LOVE ON THE VERGE OF A DECISION WE ALL TREMBLE HOPE PAUSES WITH FLUTTERING WINGS BUT NOW AT LAST SHE WAS VERY NEAR
1963-142393-0050 AND ADAM ROSE FROM THE STONE WALL IT HAPPENED THAT JUST AS HE WALKED FORWARD DINAH HAD PAUSED AND TURNED ROUND TO LOOK BACK AT THE VILLAGE
1963-142393-0051 ADAM WAS GLAD FOR WITH THE FINE INSTINCT OF A LOVER HE FELT THAT IT WOULD BE BEST FOR HER TO HEAR HIS VOICE BEFORE SHE SAW HIM HE CAME WITHIN THREE PACES OF HER AND THEN SAID DINAH
1963-142393-0052 SHE STARTED WITHOUT LOOKING ROUND AS IF SHE CONNECTED THE SOUND WITH NO PLACE DINAH ADAM SAID AGAIN
1963-142393-0053 WHAT WAS IN HER MIND SHE WAS SO ACCUSTOMED TO THINK OF IMPRESSIONS AS PURELY SPIRITUAL MONITIONS THAT SHE LOOKED FOR NO MATERIAL VISIBLE ACCOMPANIMENT OF THE VOICE BUT THIS SECOND TIME SHE LOOKED ROUND
1963-142393-0054 WHAT A LOOK OF YEARNING LOVE IT WAS THAT THE MILD GREY EYES TURNED ON THE STRONG DARK EYED MAN SHE DID NOT START AGAIN AT THE SIGHT OF HIM SHE SAID NOTHING BUT MOVED TOWARDS HIM SO THAT HIS ARM COULD CLASP HER ROUND
1963-142393-0055 AND THEY WALKED ON SO IN SILENCE WHILE THE WARM TEARS FELL ADAM WAS CONTENT AND SAID NOTHING IT WAS DINAH WHO SPOKE FIRST ADAM SHE SAID IT IS THE DIVINE WILL
1963-142393-0056 MY SOUL IS SO KNIT TO YOURS THAT IT IS BUT A DIVIDED LIFE I LIVE WITHOUT YOU AND THIS MOMENT NOW YOU ARE WITH ME AND I FEEL THAT OUR HEARTS ARE FILLED WITH THE SAME LOVE I HAVE A FULNESS OF STRENGTH
1963-142393-0057 TO BEAR AND DO OUR HEAVENLY FATHER'S WILL THAT I HAD LOST BEFORE ADAM PAUSED AND LOOKED INTO HER SINCERE EYES THEN WE'LL NEVER PART ANY MORE DINAH TILL DEATH PARTS US AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER

1970-10594-0004 MISSUS CAREW AND THE CHILD WERE STILL AT THE ADDRESS SHE HAD GIVEN ME ALL LOOKED WELL IN THAT DIRECTION
1970-10594-0005 MISS PORTER WHO CAME IN HASTE TO GREET ME WORE THE CAREWORN LOOK OF A LONG AND UNRELIEVED VIGIL
1970-10594-0006 HOW COULD I SHE ASKED WHEN MISSUS OCUMPAUGH DID NOT CLOSE HER EYES SHE DID NOT EVEN LIE DOWN BUT SAT ALL NIGHT IN AN ARM CHAIR WHICH SHE HAD WHEELED INTO GWENDOLEN'S ROOM
1970-10594-0007 STARING LIKE ONE WHO SEES NOTHING OUT INTO THE NIGHT THROUGH THE WINDOW WHICH OVERLOOKS THE RIVER THIS MORNING WE CAN NOT MAKE HER SPEAK HER EYES ARE DRY WITH FEVER ONLY NOW AND THEN SHE UTTERS A LITTLE MOAN
1970-10594-0008 THE DOCTOR SAYS SHE WILL NOT LIVE TO SEE HER HUSBAND UNLESS SOMETHING COMES TO ROUSE HER BUT THE PAPERS GIVE NO NEWS AND ALL THE ATTEMPTS OF THE POLICE END IN NOTHING
1970-10594-0009 YOU SAW WHAT A DISMAL FAILURE THEIR LAST ATTEMPT WAS THE CHILD ON WHICH THEY COUNTED PROVED TO BE BOTH RED HAIRED AND POCK MARKED GWENDOLEN APPEARS TO BE LOST LOST
1970-10594-0010 IN SPITE OF THE DESPAIR THUS EXPRESSED MY WAY SEEMED TO OPEN A LITTLE I THINK I CAN BREAK MISSUS OCUMPAUGH'S DANGEROUS APATHY IF YOU WILL LET ME SEE HER AGAIN WILL YOU LET ME TRY THE NURSE WE HAVE A NURSE NOW
1970-10594-0011 WILL NOT CONSENT I FEAR THEN TELEPHONE TO THE DOCTOR TELL HIM I AM THE ONLY MAN WHO CAN DO ANYTHING FOR MISSUS OCUMPAUGH THIS WILL NOT BE AN EXAGGERATION WAIT I WILL GET HIS ORDER
1970-10594-0012 I DO NOT KNOW WHY I HAVE SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN YOU IN ANOTHER FIFTEEN MINUTES SHE CAME TO LEAD ME TO MISSUS OCUMPAUGH I ENTERED WITHOUT KNOCKING THEY TOLD ME TO SHE WAS SEATED AS THEY SAID IN A LARGE CHAIR
1970-10594-0013 BUT WITH NO EASE TO HERSELF FOR SHE WAS NOT EVEN LEANING AGAINST ITS BACK
1970-10594-0014 WHERE FROM WHAT SHE HAD INTIMATED TO ME IN OUR LAST INTERVIEW
1970-10594-0015 THERE WAS A MINIATURE IN HER HAND BUT I SAW AT FIRST GLANCE THAT IT WAS NOT THE FACE OF GWENDOLEN OVER WHICH HER FINGERS CLOSED SO SPASMODICALLY IT WAS HER HUSBAND'S PORTRAIT WHICH SHE HELD
1970-10594-0016 AND IT WAS HIS FACE AROUSED AND FULL OF DENUNCIATION WHICH SHE EVIDENTLY SAW IN HER FANCY AS I DREW NEARER HER IN MY EFFORTS TO ATTRACT HER ATTENTION FOR A SHIVER SUDDENLY CONTRACTED HER LOVELY FEATURES
1970-10594-0017 AND SHE THREW HER ARMS OUT AS IF TO WARD FROM HERSELF SOMETHING WHICH SHE HAD NO POWER TO MEET IN DOING THIS HER HEAD TURNED SLIGHTLY AND SHE SAW ME INSTANTLY THE SPELL UNDER WHICH SHE SAT FROZEN
1970-10594-0018 YIELDED TO A RECOGNITION OF SOMETHING BESIDES HER OWN TERRIBLE BROODING SHE LET HER ARMS DROP AND THE LIPS WHICH HAD NOT SPOKEN THAT MORNING MOVED SLIGHTLY I WAITED RESPECTFULLY
1970-10594-0019 I SAW THAT IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WOULD SPEAK YOU HAVE COME SHE PANTED OUT AT LAST TO HEAR MY DECISION IT IS TOO SOON THE STEAMER HAS TWENTY FOUR HOURS YET BEFORE IT CAN MAKE PORT
1970-10594-0020 I HAVE NOT FINISHED WEIGHING MY LIFE AGAINST THE GOOD OPINION OF HIM I LIVE FOR THEN FAINTLY MISSUS CAREW HAS GONE TO NEW YORK I FINISHED NO FARTHER THAN THAT
1970-10594-0021 SHE ASKED ANXIOUSLY SHE HAS NOT SAILED I DID NOT SEE HOW IT WAS COMPATIBLE WITH MY DUTY TO LET HER MISSUS OCUMPAUGH'S WHOLE FORM COLLAPSED THE DANGEROUS APATHY WAS CREEPING OVER HER AGAIN
1970-10594-0022 YOU ARE DECIDING FOR ME SHE SPOKE VERY FAINTLY YOU AND DOCTOR POOL
1970-10594-0023 NO NOT YET I WANTED HER TO CHOOSE THE NOBLE COURSE FOR MISTER OCUMPAUGH'S SAKE YES AND FOR HER OWN NO I VENTURED TO REJOIN YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN SETTLE YOUR OWN FATE
1970-10594-0024 THE WORD MUST COME FROM YOU I AM ONLY TRYING TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR YOU TO MEET YOUR HUSBAND WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL WRONG TO BLUNT HIS POSSIBLE FORGIVENESS OH HE WILL NEVER FORGIVE
1970-10594-0025 AND I HAVE LOST ALL AND THE SET LOOK RETURNED IN ITS FULL FORCE
1970-10594-0026 MISSUS OCUMPAUGH WE MAY NEVER HAVE ANOTHER MOMENT TOGETHER IN CONFIDENCE THERE IS ONE THING I HAVE NEVER TOLD YOU SOMETHING WHICH I THINK YOU OUGHT TO KNOW AS IT MAY AFFECT YOUR WHOLE FUTURE COURSE
1970-10594-0027 IT CONCERNS GWENDOLEN'S REAL MOTHER YOU SAY YOU DO NOT KNOW HER NO
1970-10594-0028 MY DARLING IS HAPPY WITH MISSUS CAREW TOO HAPPY
1970-10594-0029 ALARMED I PUT OUT MY HAND IN A SOOTHING GESTURE
1970-10594-0030 I MADE HASTE TO SAY LISTEN TO MY LITTLE STORY IT WILL NOT ADD TO YOUR PAIN RATHER ALLEVIATE IT
1970-10594-0031 I ALSO KNEW THAT THIS PATIENT HAD OVERHEARD WHAT YOU SAID AS WELL AS I FOR IMPERVIOUS AS THE DOOR LOOKED I HAD OFTEN HEARD THE DOCTOR'S MUTTERINGS WHEN HE THOUGHT I WAS SAFE BEYOND EAR SHOT IF NOT ASLEEP
1970-10594-0032 YES SHE WAS READY TO MAKE HER COMPACT WITH THE DOCTOR JUST AS YOU HAD DONE BEFORE SHE LEFT EVERYTHING WAS ARRANGED FOR IT WAS HER CHILD YOU TOOK REARED LOVED AND HAVE NOW LOST
1970-10594-0033 AT ANOTHER TIME SHE MIGHT HAVE RESENTED THESE WORDS ESPECIALLY THE LAST BUT I HAD ROUSED HER CURIOSITY HER PANTING EAGER CURIOSITY AND SHE LET THEM PASS ALTOGETHER UNCHALLENGED DID YOU SEE THIS WOMAN
1970-10594-0034 WAS SHE OF COMMON BLOOD COMMON MANNERS IT DOES NOT SEEM POSSIBLE GWENDOLEN IS BY NATURE SO DAINTY IN ALL HER WAYS THE WOMAN WAS A LADY I DID NOT SEE HER FACE IT WAS HEAVILY VEILED
1970-10594-0035 BUT I HEARD HER VOICE IT WAS A LADY'S VOICE AND WHAT SHE WORE BEAUTIFUL JEWELS JEWELS YOU SAID SHE WAS POOR SO SHE DECLARED HERSELF BUT SHE HAD ON HER NECK UNDER HER COAT
1970-10594-0036 A STRING OF BEADS WHICH WERE BOTH VALUABLE AND OF EXQUISITE WORKMANSHIP I KNOW BECAUSE IT BROKE JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING AND THE BEADS FELL ALL OVER THE FLOOR AND ONE ROLLED MY WAY AND I PICKED IT UP SCAMP THAT I WAS
1970-10594-0037 WHEN BOTH THEIR BACKS WERE TURNED IN THEIR SEARCH FOR THE OTHERS A BEAD A COSTLY BEAD AND YOU WERE NOT FOUND OUT NO MISSUS OCUMPAUGH SHE NEVER SEEMED TO MISS IT
1970-10594-0038 TO COUNT CORRECTLY SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD THEM ALL BUT THIS HAS BEEN IN MY POCKET FOR SIX YEARS PERHAPS YOU HAVE SEEN ITS LIKE
1970-10594-0039 TILL YESTERDAY YESTERDAY HER GREAT EYES HAGGARD WITH SUFFERING ROSE TO MINE THEN THEY FELL ON THE BEAD WHICH I HAD TAKEN FROM MY POCKET THE CRY SHE GAVE WAS NOT LOUD BUT IT EFFECTUALLY SETTLED ALL MY DOUBTS
1970-10594-0040 I ASKED IMPRESSIVELY FOR MINUTES SHE DID NOT ANSWER SHE WAS TREMBLING LIKE A LEAF HER MOTHER SHE EXCLAIMED AT LAST HER MOTHER HER OWN MOTHER
1970-10594-0041 AND SHE NEVER HINTED IT TO ME BY WORD OR LOOK OH VALERIE VALERIE WHAT TORTURES WE HAVE BOTH SUFFERED AND NOW YOU ARE HAPPY WHILE I GRIEF SEEMED TO ENGULF HER
1970-10594-0042 FEELING MY POSITION KEENLY I WALKED TO THE WINDOW BUT SOON TURNED AND CAME BACK IN RESPONSE TO HER CRY I MUST SEE MISSUS CAREW INSTANTLY
1970-10594-0043 THEY WILL THINK I HAVE GONE TO BE ON HAND TO MEET MISTER OCUMPAUGH AND WILL SAY THAT I HAVE NOT THE STRENGTH OVERRIDE THEIR OBJECTIONS I PUT MY WHOLE CAUSE IN YOUR HANDS YOU WILL GO WITH ME
1970-10594-0044 WITH PLEASURE MADAM AND THUS WAS THAT TERRIFYING APATHY BROKEN UP
1970-26100-0000 HER WILLINGNESS TO BREAK OUR FRIENDSHIP AT THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY GAVE ME LITTLE ROOM TO THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE THAT SHE SHOULD RISK HER REPUTATION TO RUN AFTER THAT MAN WAS INEXPLICABLE BUT IT WAS JUST LIKE A WOMAN
1970-26100-0001 IF SHE COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT ME I COULD GET ALONG WITHOUT HER I'M THE EASIEST GOING PERSON IN THE WORLD BUT WHEN IT COMES TO ALLOWING THE GIRL YOU ARE PRACTICALLY ENGAGED TO TO MAKE A FOOL OF HERSELF OVER ANOTHER MAN I WON'T STAND FOR IT
1970-26100-0002 AND SHE DIDN'T KNOW BUT I MADE UP MY MIND THAT SHE WOULD HAVE TO GIVE ME AN AWFULLY GOOD REASON FOR HER SUDDEN INTEREST IN FRANK WOODS BEFORE I WOULD FORGIVE HER THESE THOUGHTS HELD MY ATTENTION ALL THE WAY OUT
1970-26100-0003 NOW AND AGAIN I WOULD BE RECALLED FROM MY GLOOM BY SOME QUESTION FROM THE CORONER HE WAS TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF WHO MURDERED JIM
1970-26100-0004 AS WE NEARED THE BRIDGE I NOTICED AGAIN HOW SCANT THE VEGETATION WAS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE ROAD ANY ONE WISHING TO MURDER JIM WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE HIM COMING
1970-26100-0005 COULD BE SEEN THE THIRTEENTH HOLE OF THE COUNTRY CLUB GOLF LINKS WHEN WE REACHED THE CREST OF THE HILL LEADING DOWN TO THE BRIDGE OUR EYES AT ONCE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A TALL MAPLE TREE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE ROAD AND ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM IT
1970-26100-0006 AS HE SAW IT THE CORONER GAVE A GRUNT OF SATISFACTION THERE'S OUR TREE WE STOPPED THE CAR AND SCRAMBLED THROUGH THE THORNY BUSHES THAT LINED THE ROAD THE GROUND WAS HARD CLAY WITH ONLY BURDOCK AND WEEDS GROWING ON IT
1970-26100-0007 THERE WAS NOTHING THAT WOULD LEAD US TO BELIEVE THAT ANY ONE HAD BEEN THERE BEFORE WHEN WE REACHED THE TREE THE CORONER EXAMINED THE GROUND AROUND IT CAREFULLY WHEN HE AROSE HE SEEMED DISAPPOINTED WHAT DID YOU EXPECT TO FIND HERE I ASKED
1970-26100-0008 I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WE MIGHT FIND IF THE MAN WHO FIRED THOSE SHOTS USED THIS TREE I THOUGHT WE MIGHT FIND AN EMPTY CARTRIDGE OR TWO THERE OUGHT TO BE AT LEAST SOME BROKEN TWIGS OR SOMETHING TO SHOW THAT HE WAS UP THERE BUT I FIND NOTHING AT ALL
1970-26100-0009 STILL THE FACT THAT THE TREE IS WHERE IT IS MAKES THE THEORY PLAUSIBLE HE SHOOK HIS HEAD NO NOW THAT I'VE SEEN HOW FAR WE ARE FROM THE ROAD I DON'T THINK IT DOES
1970-26100-0010 THOSE BULLET HOLES IN THE BACK OF THE CAR WERE FIRED FROM ABOVE AND BEHIND THE MACHINE THEY SLANTED DOWN BUT NOT SIDEWISE
1970-26100-0011 BUT IF THE MURDERER USED THIS TREE TWO HUNDRED YARDS FROM THE ROAD HE WOULD HAVE STARTED FIRING BEFORE THE CAR CAME OPPOSITE
1970-26100-0012 I'M SORRY FOR WHEN I SAW THIS TREE I THOUGHT WE'D STRUCK THE RIGHT TRACK THERE'S ONE THING I CAN'T MAKE OUT I STATED AND THAT IS THE STRANGE CRY OF MY SISTER IN HER DELIRIUM LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US SHE CALLED OUT
1970-26100-0013 AND I WOULD BE WILLING TO SWEAR IT HAD SOMETHING TO DO WITH THE MURDER THE CORONER THOUGHT A MOMENT THEN TURNED TO ME WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY NOTHING THAT SEEMED TO REFER TO THE ACCIDENT ALL THE REST WAS APPARENTLY DELIRIUM
1970-26100-0014 SHE BEGGED FORGIVENESS FOR SOME FANCIED WRONG AND REPEATED THAT A CERTAIN MAN WAS NOT GUILTY OF DISHONESTY BUT HER FIRST WEIRD CRY HAD TO DO WITH THE MURDER I'M SURE
1970-26100-0015 EVERYTHING POINTS TO AN AEROPLANE IT WAS DONE A HUNDRED YES A THOUSAND TIMES IN THE WAR WHILE I WAS OVER THERE WITH MY HOSPITAL UNIT WE USED TO GET A LOT OF CASES OF MOTORCYCLE DESPATCH RIDERS WHO HAD BEEN PICKED OFF BY GERMAN AVIATORS
1970-26100-0016 AND IS THE HEAD OF AN AEROPLANE FIRM BUT I DON'T THINK HE HAS AN AEROPLANE HERE HE COULD GET ONE EASY ENOUGH THE CLEVER DEVIL LOOK OVER THERE HE HAD THE BROAD SWEEP OF THE GOLF COURSE AS A PERFECT LANDING GROUND
1970-26100-0017 HELPLESS BEFORE APPROACHING DEATH I COULD IMAGINE HELEN'S AGONY AS SHE SAW THAT DIM BLACK SHAPE
1970-26100-0018 LOOK OUT JIM IT'S GOING TO HIT US YES BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO PROVE IT I ASKED THAT'S UP TO US NOW AN AEROPLANE HAS SUCH SPEED THAT IT WAS EASY FOR WOODS TO FASHION AN INGENIOUS ALIBI
1970-26100-0019 TO ACCOUNT FOR EVERY MINUTE OF HIS TIME ON THE NIGHT OF THE MURDER BUT THERE MUST BE SOME HOLES IN IT THERE ALWAYS IS IN A MANUFACTURED ALIBI I WANT YOU TO GO OVER TO THE COUNTRY CLUB AND CHECK UP MISTER WOODS SCHEDULE OF THAT NIGHT
1970-26100-0020 WHILE I EXAMINE THE GOLF LINKS TO SEE IF HE LANDED THERE WE JUMPED INTO MY CAR AND DROVE RAPIDLY TO THE CLUB I WENT INTO THE HOUSE BY THE BACK WAY TO AVOID MEETING PEOPLE AND ASKED FOR JACKSON
1970-26100-0021 JACKSON WHAT TIME DID MISTER WOODS GET OUT HERE ON THE EVENING MISTER FELDERSON WAS KILLED
1970-26100-0022 DID YOU SEE HIM AT THAT TIME

1970-26100-0031 GROGAN DO YOU REMEMBER WHO WAS IN THE BAR BETWEEN SEVEN THIRTY AND EIGHT THIRTY ON THE NIGHT OF THE FELDERSON MURDER ONLY ONE OR TWO OF THE GENTLEMEN SIR THERE WAS MISTER FARNSWORTH AND MISTER BROWN AND I THINK MISTER WOODS
1970-26100-0032 ARE YOU SURE MISTER WOODS WAS IN HERE WELL NO SIR NOT EXACTLY I REMEMBER MISTER FARNSWORTH AND MISTER BROWN THERE WERE PROBABLY SOME OTHERS THE REASON I THINK MISTER WOODS WAS HERE
1970-26100-0033 WAS BECAUSE HE CALLED MY ATTENTION TO THE FACT A FEW NIGHTS AFTER THE MURDER THERE WERE A FEW GENTLEMEN IN HERE AND THEY WERE TALKING OF MISTER FELDERSON'S DEATH MISTER WOODS SAID IN VIEW OF THE FACT THAT THE MURDERER HADN'T BEEN FOUND
1970-26100-0034 ALMOST ANY ONE MIGHT BE ACCUSED SOME ONE ASKED HIM IF HE WAS WORRIED WE ALL KNEW SIR THAT MISTER FELDERSON AND MISTER WOODS WERE NOT VERY FRIENDLY AND MISTER WOODS LAUGHED AND SAID THAT FORTUNATELY HE HAD A PERFECT ALIBI
1970-26100-0035 OH HIS ALIBI IS GOOD OF COURSE BECAUSE HE WAS AROUND THE CLUB ALL THAT EVENING I GUESS HE WAS HERE AND I DON'T REMEMBER IT I SHOOK HANDS WITH HIM AND LEFT FAR OUT ON THE GOLF LINKS THE CORONER WAS BENDING OVER EXAMINING SOMETHING ON THE GROUND
1970-26100-0036 PARALLELING EACH OTHER FOR ALMOST A HUNDRED YARDS
1970-28415-0000 THEY UNTIED IT AND LED IT AWAY SOME OF THEM PUT THEIR CLOTHES ON THE DONKEY'S BACK FOR A KING MUST RIDE IN COMFORT OTHERS SPREAD THEIR CLOTHES OUT ON THE STREET FOR A KING SHOULD RIDE IN STATE
1970-28415-0001 JESUS GOT ON THE DONKEY AND STARTED FOR JERUSALEM THE DISCIPLES WALKED AHEAD WHEN THEY HAD ALMOST REACHED THE CITY THE DISCIPLES BEGAN TO SHOUT JESUS USED TO SAY THAT THEY MUST NOT TELL ANYONE THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
1970-28415-0002 BUT NOW THEY COULD TELL THE WHOLE WORLD FOR JESUS WANTED EVERYONE TO KNOW THEY WERE GLAD THAT THEY DID NOT HAVE TO BE QUIET ANY LONGER
1970-28415-0003 AND WAS A CRY OF WELCOME THEY SHOUTED THE WORDS OF A PSALM HOSANNA TO THE SON OF DAVID
1970-28415-0004 HOSANNA IN THE HIGHEST THE CITY WAS CROWDED WITH TRAVELERS FROM ALL OVER PALESTINE AND FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES TOO THEY WERE THE PILGRIMS WHO HAD COME FOR THE PASSOVER FEAST THE CROWDS SAW THE PROCESSION COMING THEY SAW THE DONKEY
1970-28415-0005 SOME OF THE CROWDS BEGAN TO SHOUT WITH THE DISCIPLES A GREAT CRY OF HOSANNA WENT RINGING DOWN THE STREET EVERYONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING IT
1970-28415-0006 SOME CUT BRANCHES FROM THE TREES AND WAVED THEM BEFORE THE MESSIAH IT WAS A ROYAL WELCOME ONLY THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS AND THE PHARISEES WERE SORRY TO SEE JESUS COME WHAT IS THERE WE CAN DO THEY SAID TO ONE ANOTHER
1970-28415-0007 WHO IS THIS THEY ASKED OTHERS WHO KNEW HIM ANSWERED WHY THIS IS JESUS THE PROPHET FROM NAZARETH IN GALILEE
1970-28415-0008 THIS WAS HIS FATHER'S HOUSE AND HIS HOUSE THESE WERE HIS FATHER'S PEOPLE AND HIS PEOPLE THE KING FOR WHOM THE JEWS HAD BEEN WAITING HAD COME AT LAST TO REIGN
1970-28415-0009 THIS TIME HE CARRIED A WHIP IN THE COURT OF THE GENTILES THE MONEY WAS CLINKING AS IT HAD DONE WHEN JESUS WAS A BOY AT TABLES SAT THE MEN WHO GREW RICH BY EXCHANGING THE MONEY OF VISITORS FOR COINS USED IN JERUSALEM
1970-28415-0010 OTHERS WERE SELLING DOVES FOR SACRIFICE THE POOR HAD TO PAY HEAVILY TO WORSHIP GOD IN HIS OWN HOUSE JESUS STRODE DOWN THE ROOM WITH THE WHIP IN HIS HAND AND UPSET THE TABLES WHERE THE MONEY WAS
1970-28415-0011 WHEN THE MEN JUMPED UP FROM THEIR CHAIRS HE DROVE THEM OUT OF THE TEMPLE THEN HE DROVE THE SHEEP AND THE CATTLE OUT AFTER THE MEN IT IS WRITTEN IN THE SCRIPTURES GOD'S HOUSE SHALL BE A HOUSE OF PRAYER
1970-28415-0012 BUT YOU HAVE MADE IT INTO A DEN OF THIEVES AND ROBBERS HE CRIED THIS WAS TOO MUCH FOR THE PRIESTS OF THE TEMPLE AND ALL THE IMPORTANT MEN WHO RULED JERUSALEM THE NEXT DAY SOME OF THE RULERS CAME TO JESUS AND SAID
1970-28415-0013 WHAT RIGHT HAVE YOU TO DO THESE THINGS WHO TOLD YOU THAT YOU COULD ACT LIKE THIS SO FAR JESUS HAD NEVER SAID THAT HE WAS THE MESSIAH
1970-28415-0014 BUT JESUS WAS TOO QUICK FOR THEM HE SAID I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION IF YOU ANSWER A QUESTION OF MINE WHEN JOHN THE BAPTIST USED TO PREACH TO YOU AND BAPTIZE PEOPLE WHO GAVE HIM THE RIGHT TO DO THAT
1970-28415-0015 THEN THE RULERS DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY THEY THOUGHT TO THEMSELVES NOW IF WE SAY THAT JOHN WAS SENT BY GOD TO PREACH HE WILL SAY WHY DIDN'T YOU LISTEN TO HIM THEN IF WE SAY THAT JOHN DIDN'T HAVE ANY RIGHT TO PREACH
1970-28415-0016 NEITHER AM I GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT RIGHT I HAVE TO DO THESE THINGS EVERY DAY THAT WEEK JESUS CAME AND TAUGHT IN THE TEMPLE SEVERAL TIMES HIS ENEMIES TRIED TO TRICK HIM INTO SAYING SOMETHING THAT WOULD TURN THE PEOPLE AGAINST HIM
1970-28415-0017 BUT JESUS ALWAYS HAD AN ANSWER WHICH SILENCED THEM ONCE THEY CAME AND ASKED SHOULD WE PAY TAXES TO THE ROMANS THAT WAS A HARD QUESTION
1970-28415-0018 EVERYBODY WOULD HATE HIM TOO BUT IF HE SAID THEY SHOULD NOT PAY THE TAXES WELL THEY COULD COUNT ON THE ROMAN GOVERNOR TO SETTLE WITH JESUS THEN
1970-28415-0019 THERE WAS A MAN'S PICTURE STAMPED ON ONE SIDE OF IT JESUS SAID WHOSE PICTURE IS THAT WHY THEY ANSWERED THAT IS A PICTURE OF CAESAR THE EMPEROR OF ROME ALL RIGHT SAID JESUS
1970-28415-0020 DO WHATEVER YOUR DUTY IS TO CAESAR AND HIS GOVERNMENT YOU WILL HAVE TO DECIDE ABOUT THAT FOR YOURSELVES AND ALSO DO YOUR DUTY TO GOD IT WAS SUCH A CLEVER ANSWER THAT NO ONE HAD A WORD TO SAY
1970-28415-0021 WATCH OUT FOR THE SCRIBES AND THE PHARISEES HE TOLD THE PEOPLE AND DON'T BE LIKE THEM THEY LOVE TO WALK AROUND IN THEIR LONG WHITE ROBES AND TO HAVE EVERYBODY BOW TO THEM IN THE STREET AND TO SIT IN THE BEST SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUES AND AT DINNERS
1970-28415-0022 WHICH PEOPLE WALK OVER WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT IS UNDERNEATH NOBODY KNOWS HOW BAD YOU ARE YOU SNAKES HOW CAN YOU ESCAPE THE PUNISHMENT WHICH GOD IS BRINGING UPON YOU HE LEFT THE PHARISEES AND WENT INTO THE TEMPLE
1970-28415-0023 WHERE PEOPLE WERE MAKING THEIR GIFTS TO GOD
1970-28415-0024 THEN CAME A POOR WIDOW WHO PUT TWO SMALL COINS INTO THE BOX JESUS CALLED HIS DISCIPLES TO HIM AND SAID I TELL YOU THIS POOR WIDOW HAS GIVEN MORE THAN ALL THESE RICH PEOPLE ARE GIVING
1970-28415-0025 AND IT DOESN'T COST THEM ANYTHING TO GIVE WHAT THEY DO BUT THIS POOR WOMAN NEEDS HER MONEY AND SHE HAS GIVEN ALL SHE HAS WITH MANY WORDS AND STORIES HE TAUGHT THE PEOPLE WHO THRONGED AROUND HIM ON THE DAYS OF THAT WEEK
1970-28415-0026 AND THIS WAS THE LAST STORY HE EVER TOLD SOMEDAY I SHALL SIT UPON MY THRONE AND JUDGE ALL THE NATIONS OF THE EARTH TO SOME PEOPLE I WILL SAY COME MY HEAVENLY FATHER LOVES YOU
1970-28415-0027 TAKE THE REWARD HE HAS PLANNED FOR YOU TO HAVE FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND YOU GAVE ME FOOD I WAS THIRSTY AND YOU GAVE ME SOMETHING TO DRINK I WAS A STRANGER AND YOU TOOK ME INTO YOUR HOMES
1970-28415-0028 I HAD NOTHING TO WEAR AND YOU GAVE ME CLOTHES I WAS SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU CAME TO VISIT ME THEN THESE PEOPLE WILL BE SURPRISED AND SAY LORD WHEN DID WE EVER DO ANYTHING FOR YOU
1970-28415-0029 THEN I WILL SAY TO OTHERS GO AWAY GOD WANTS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU FOR I WAS HUNGRY AND THIRSTY AND NAKED AND SICK AND IN PRISON AND YOU DID NOTHING AT ALL FOR ME
1970-28415-0030 THESE PEOPLE WILL ALSO BE SURPRISED THEY WILL SAY LORD
1970-28415-0031 IF WE HAD SEEN YOU NEEDING ANYTHING WE WOULD HAVE HELPED YOU AND I WILL SAY MANY POOR PEOPLE NEEDED YOUR HELP AND YOU DID NOT HELP THEM WHEN YOU FAILED THEM YOU FAILED ME AND NOW IT IS TOO LATE
1970-28415-0032 IF HE HEARD THAT THERE WAS SOMEONE IN JERUSALEM PRETENDING TO BE KING OF THE JEWS THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS WANTED TO KILL JESUS THAT WAS ALL THEY TALKED ABOUT BUT THEY DID NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS TO BE DONE
1970-28415-0033 FOR WHENEVER JESUS CAME TO JERUSALEM GREAT CROWDS GATHERED AROUND HIM NONE OF THE PRIESTS DARED TO LAY A FINGER ON HIM IN THE OPEN THE CROWDS WOULD NEVER LET THEM IT SEEMED TO THE PEOPLE AS IF THE MESSIAH MIGHT HAVE COME AT LAST
1970-28415-0034 BUT SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE THE PRIESTS AND THE RULERS SAID THE WEEK WAS GOING BY
1970-28415-0035 WE SHALL HAVE TO DO AWAY WITH JESUS QUIETLY SOMEONE SAID YES THE OTHERS AGREED WE CAN'T WAIT TILL THE DAY OF THE PASSOVER IF WE SHOULD DO ANYTHING TO HIM ON THAT DAY THERE WOULD BE A RIOT
1970-28415-0036 THEY WERE AT THEIR WITS END TO KNOW HOW TO GET RID OF JESUS THE CRAFTIEST MEN IN JERUSALEM COULD NOT THINK WHAT TO DO THERE WAS A KNOCK AT THE DOOR IT WAS ONE OF JESUS TWELVE DISCIPLES
1970-28415-0037 WHAT WILL YOU GIVE ME JUDAS SAID IF I TURN JESUS OVER TO YOU THE PRIESTS AND RULERS COULD HARDLY BELIEVE THEIR EARS THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER YOU SHALL HAVE THEY CRIED IF YOU GIVE US JESUS
1970-28415-0038 SO FOR THIRTY PIECES OF SILVER JUDAS AGREED TO SHOW THEM WHERE JESUS WAS AT SOME TIME WHEN THERE WAS NO ONE AROUND BUT THE TWELVE DISCIPLES SEND SOLDIERS WHEN I TELL YOU JUDAS SAID
1970-28415-0039 THE OTHER DISCIPLES WILL ALL BE THERE AND THE SOLDIERS WON'T KNOW WHICH MAN TO TAKE BUT I WILL GO UP TO JESUS AND KISS HIM THE MAN I KISS WILL BE THE ONE YOU WANT
198-126831-0000 FRIDAY WAS A COMFORTABLE DAY IN THE HOUSEHOLD OF KING EVERYBODY WAS IN GOOD HUMOUR THE STORY GIRL SPARKLED THROUGH SEVERAL TALES THAT RANGED FROM THE AFRITES AND JINNS OF EASTERN MYTH THROUGH THE PIPING DAYS OF CHIVALRY DOWN TO THE HOMELY ANECDOTES OF CARLISLE WORKADAY FOLKS

198-126831-0014 I'D LIKE TO SIGHED FELICITY BUT WE'D COME HOME TIRED AND WITH ALL THE MILKING TO DO YOU BOYS BETTER GO ALONE PETER AND I WILL ATTEND TO THE MILKING FOR ONE EVENING SAID UNCLE ROGER YOU CAN ALL GO
198-126831-0015 I HAVE AN IDEA THAT A RASPBERRY PIE FOR TO MORROW NIGHT WHEN THE FOLKS COME HOME WOULD HIT THE RIGHT SPOT ACCORDINGLY AFTER TEA WE ALL SET OFF ARMED WITH JUGS AND CUPS FELICITY THOUGHTFUL CREATURE ALSO TOOK A SMALL BASKETFUL OF JELLY COOKIES ALONG WITH HER
198-126831-0016 A PRETTY WALK THROUGH A WORLD OF GREEN WHISPERING BOUGHS AND SPICE SWEET FERNS AND SHIFTING PATCHES OF SUNLIGHT THE RASPBERRIES WERE PLENTIFUL
198-126831-0017 THEN WE FOREGATHERED AROUND A TINY WOOD SPRING COLD AND PELLUCID UNDER ITS YOUNG MAPLES AND ATE THE JELLY COOKIES AND THE STORY GIRL TOLD US A TALE OF A HAUNTED SPRING IN A MOUNTAIN GLEN WHERE A FAIR WHITE LADY DWELT
198-126831-0018 WHO PLEDGED ALL COMERS IN A GOLDEN CUP WITH JEWELS BRIGHT AND IF YOU DRANK OF THE CUP WITH HER SAID THE STORY GIRL HER EYES GLOWING THROUGH THE EMERALD DUSK ABOUT US YOU WERE NEVER SEEN IN THE WORLD AGAIN YOU WERE WHISKED STRAIGHTWAY TO FAIRYLAND AND LIVED THERE WITH A FAIRY BRIDE
198-126831-0019 I THINK THERE IS SUCH A PLACE IN SPITE OF UNCLE EDWARD SAID THE STORY GIRL DREAMILY AND I THINK THERE IS A WAY OF GETTING THERE TOO IF WE COULD ONLY FIND IT
198-126831-0020 ONE BITTER DAY WHEN THEY SEEK IT
198-126831-0021 AND THAT IS THE TRAGEDY OF LIFE ON THAT DAY THE GATES OF EDEN ARE SHUT BEHIND THEM AND THE AGE OF GOLD IS OVER HENCEFORTH THEY MUST DWELL IN THE COMMON LIGHT OF COMMON DAY ONLY A FEW WHO REMAIN CHILDREN AT HEART CAN EVER FIND THAT FAIR LOST PATH AGAIN
198-126831-0022 THEY AND ONLY THEY CAN BRING US TIDINGS FROM THAT DEAR COUNTRY WHERE WE ONCE SOJOURNED AND FROM WHICH WE MUST EVERMORE BE EXILES THE WORLD CALLS THEM ITS SINGERS AND POETS AND ARTISTS AND STORY TELLERS
198-126831-0023 AS WE SAT THERE THE AWKWARD MAN PASSED BY WITH HIS GUN OVER HIS SHOULDER AND HIS DOG AT HIS SIDE HE DID NOT LOOK LIKE AN AWKWARD MAN THERE IN THE HEART OF THE MAPLE WOODS
198-126831-0024 HE STRODE ALONG RIGHT MASTERFULLY AND LIFTED HIS HEAD WITH THE AIR OF ONE WHO WAS MONARCH OF ALL HE SURVEYED THE STORY GIRL KISSED HER FINGERTIPS TO HIM WITH THE DELIGHTFUL AUDACITY WHICH WAS A PART OF HER
198-126831-0025 YOU'D UNDERSTAND WHY IF YOU EVER SAW HIM AT A PARTY OR A PICNIC SAID FELICITY TRYING TO PASS PLATES AND DROPPING THEM WHENEVER A WOMAN LOOKED AT HIM THEY SAY IT'S PITIFUL TO SEE HIM I MUST GET WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THAT MAN NEXT SUMMER SAID THE STORY GIRL
198-126831-0026 IF I PUT IT OFF ANY LONGER IT WILL BE TOO LATE I'M GROWING SO FAST AUNT OLIVIA SAYS I'LL HAVE TO WEAR ANKLE SKIRTS NEXT SUMMER IF I BEGIN TO LOOK GROWN UP HE'LL GET FRIGHTENED OF ME AND THEN I'LL NEVER FIND OUT THE GOLDEN MILESTONE MYSTERY
198-126831-0027 DO YOU THINK HE'LL EVER TELL YOU WHO ALICE IS I ASKED I HAVE A NOTION WHO ALICE IS ALREADY SAID THE MYSTERIOUS CREATURE BUT SHE WOULD TELL US NOTHING MORE WHEN THE JELLY COOKIES WERE ALL EATEN IT WAS HIGH TIME TO BE MOVING HOMEWARD
198-126831-0028 AND THE PRECINCTS OF A POSSIBLY ENCHANTED SPRING WHEN WE REACHED THE FOOT OF THE ORCHARD AND ENTERED IT THROUGH A GAP IN THE HEDGE IT WAS THE MAGICAL MYSTICAL TIME OF BETWEEN LIGHTS OFF TO THE WEST WAS A DAFFODIL GLOW HANGING OVER THE VALLEY OF LOST SUNSETS
198-126831-0029 AND I GOT BACK ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES AGO I SET DOWN ON THE FRONT DOOR STEPS FOR A MOMENT AND ALL AT ONCE I HEARD A BELL RING IN THE HOUSE EIGHT TIMES I TELL YOU I WAS SKEERED I MADE A BOLT FOR THE ORCHARD AND YOU WON'T CATCH ME GOING NEAR THAT HOUSE TILL YOUR UNCLE ROGER COMES HOME
198-126831-0030 THERE WE STOOD IN A HUDDLED DEMORALIZED GROUP OH WHAT AN EERIE PLACE THAT ORCHARD WAS WHAT SHADOWS WHAT NOISES
198-126831-0031 WELL HERE'S THE KEY GO AND SEE FOR YOURSELF SAID PETER FELICITY HAD NO INTENTION OF GOING AND SEEING I THINK YOU BOYS OUGHT TO GO SHE SAID RETREATING BEHIND THE DEFENCE OF SEX YOU OUGHT TO BE BRAVER THAN GIRLS
198-126831-0032 SOMEBODY KILLED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT YOU KNOW NOTHING LIKE THAT EVER HAPPENED IN OUR FAMILY THE KINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RESPECTABLE PERHAPS IT IS EMILY
198-126831-0033 KING'S GHOST WHISPERED FELIX SHE NEVER APPEARED ANYWHERE BUT IN THE ORCHARD SAID THE STORY GIRL OH OH CHILDREN ISN'T THERE SOMETHING UNDER UNCLE ALEC'S TREE WE PEERED FEARFULLY THROUGH THE GLOOM THERE WAS SOMETHING SOMETHING THAT WAVERED AND FLUTTERED ADVANCED RETREATED
198-126831-0034 THAT'S ONLY MY OLD APRON SAID FELICITY I HUNG IT THERE TO DAY WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR THE WHITE HEN'S NEST OH WHAT SHALL WE DO UNCLE ROGER MAY NOT BE BACK FOR HOURS I CAN'T BELIEVE THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE HOUSE MAYBE IT'S ONLY PEG BOWEN SUGGESTED DAN
198-126831-0035 THERE WAS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COMFORT IN THIS WE WERE ALMOST AS MUCH AFRAID OF PEG BOWEN AS WE WOULD BE OF ANY SPECTRAL VISITANT PETER SCOFFED AT THE IDEA PEG BOWEN WASN'T IN THE HOUSE BEFORE YOUR UNCLE ROGER LOCKED IT UP AND HOW COULD SHE GET IN AFTERWARDS HE SAID
198-126831-0036 NO IT ISN'T PEG BOWEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT WALKS I KNOW A STORY ABOUT A GHOST SAID THE STORY GIRL THE RULING PASSION STRONG EVEN IN EXTREMITY IT IS ABOUT A GHOST WITH EYEHOLES BUT NO EYES
198-126831-0037 DON'T CRIED CECILY HYSTERICALLY DON'T YOU GO ON DON'T YOU SAY ANOTHER WORD I CAN'T BEAR IT DON'T YOU THE STORY GIRL DIDN'T BUT SHE HAD SAID ENOUGH
198-126831-0038 ALL AT ONCE SOMETHING LEAPED FROM THE BOUGH OF A TREE AND ALIGHTED BEFORE US WE SPLIT THE AIR WITH A SIMULTANEOUS SHRIEK
198-126831-0039 HE STRUGGLED OUT OF MY CLASP AND DISAPPEARED OVER THE LONG GRASSES WITH SOUNDLESS LEAPS
198-126831-0040 HE WAS A STRANGE FURTIVE ANIMAL A QUESTING BEAST PRESENTLY THE MOON ROSE BUT THIS ONLY MADE MATTERS WORSE THE SHADOWS HAD BEEN STILL BEFORE NOW THEY MOVED AND DANCED AS THE NIGHT WIND TOSSED THE BOUGHS THE OLD HOUSE WITH ITS DREADFUL SECRET
198-126831-0041 WAS WHITE AND CLEAR AGAINST THE DARK BACKGROUND OF SPRUCES WE WERE WOEFULLY TIRED BUT WE COULD NOT SIT DOWN BECAUSE THE GRASS WAS REEKING WITH DEW THE FAMILY GHOST ONLY APPEARS IN DAYLIGHT SAID THE STORY GIRL
198-126831-0042 I KNOW HE'LL LAUGH AT US AWFUL BUT IT'S BETTER TO BE LAUGHED AT THAN SCARED LIKE THIS UNCLE ROGER DID NOT COME UNTIL NEARLY TEN NEVER WAS THERE A MORE WELCOME SOUND THAN THE RUMBLE OF HIS WHEELS IN THE LANE
198-126831-0043 WE RAN TO THE ORCHARD GATE AND SWARMED ACROSS THE YARD JUST AS UNCLE ROGER ALIGHTED AT THE FRONT DOOR HE STARED AT US IN THE MOONLIGHT
198-126831-0044 THERE'S NO USE ASKING THE MEANING OF THIS I SUPPOSE SAID UNCLE ROGER WITH THE CALM OF DESPAIR I'VE GAVE UP TRYING TO FATHOM YOU YOUNG ONES PETER WHERE'S THE KEY WHAT YARN HAVE YOU BEEN TELLING
198-126831-0045 UNCLE ROGER UNLOCKED AND FLUNG OPEN THE FRONT DOOR AS HE DID SO CLEAR AND SWEET RANG OUT TEN BELL LIKE CHIMES
198-126831-0046 WE HAD TO WAIT UNTIL UNCLE ROGER STOPPED LAUGHING BEFORE WE HEARD THE EXPLANATION WE THOUGHT HE NEVER WOULD STOP
198-126831-0047 AND NOW IT HAS ALMOST FRIGHTENED YOU POOR LITTLE MONKEYS TO DEATH WE HEARD UNCLE ROGER CHUCKLING ALL THE WAY TO THE BARN
198-126831-0048 I WAS SO FRIGHTENED I WOULDN'T MIND IF HE'D LAUGH ONCE AND HAVE IT DONE WITH IT
198-126831-0049 I SHALL TELL IT TOO I DON'T CARE IF THE JOKE IS AS MUCH ON MYSELF AS ANY ONE A STORY IS A STORY NO MATTER WHO IT'S ON BUT IT IS HATEFUL TO BE LAUGHED AT AND GROWN UPS ALWAYS DO IT I NEVER WILL WHEN I'M GROWN UP I'LL REMEMBER BETTER
198-126831-0050 IT'S ALL PETER'S FAULT SAID FELICITY I DO THINK HE MIGHT HAVE HAD MORE SENSE THAN TO TAKE A CLOCK STRIKING FOR A BELL RINGING
198-126831-0051 IT DON'T SOUND A BIT LIKE OTHER CLOCKS
198-126831-0052 I WOULDN'T HAVE SAID THE STORY GIRL HONESTLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A BELL WHEN I HEARD IT AND THE DOOR OPEN TOO LET US BE FAIR FELICITY
198-126831-0053 BUT IT WAS OVER TWO HOURS SINCE WE HAD EATEN THE COOKIES AND FELICITY SUGGESTED THAT A SAUCERFUL APIECE
198-129977-0000 ELINOR SAW WITH GREAT UNEASINESS THE LOW SPIRITS OF HER FRIEND HIS VISIT AFFORDED HER BUT A VERY PARTIAL SATISFACTION
198-129977-0001 WHILE HIS OWN ENJOYMENT IN IT APPEARED SO IMPERFECT IT WAS EVIDENT THAT HE WAS UNHAPPY SHE WISHED IT WERE EQUALLY EVIDENT THAT HE STILL DISTINGUISHED HER BY THE SAME AFFECTION WHICH ONCE SHE HAD FELT NO DOUBT OF INSPIRING
198-129977-0002 BUT HITHERTO THE CONTINUANCE OF HIS PREFERENCE SEEMED VERY UNCERTAIN AND THE RESERVEDNESS OF HIS MANNER TOWARDS HER CONTRADICTED ONE MOMENT WHAT A MORE ANIMATED LOOK HAD INTIMATED THE PRECEDING ONE
198-129977-0003 HE JOINED HER AND MARIANNE IN THE BREAKFAST ROOM THE NEXT MORNING BEFORE THE OTHERS WERE DOWN AND MARIANNE WHO WAS ALWAYS EAGER TO PROMOTE THEIR HAPPINESS AS FAR AS SHE COULD SOON LEFT THEM TO THEMSELVES BUT BEFORE SHE WAS HALF WAY UPSTAIRS SHE HEARD THE PARLOUR DOOR OPEN
198-129977-0004 AS YOU ARE NOT YET READY FOR BREAKFAST
198-129977-0005 THIS WAS A SUBJECT WHICH ENSURED MARIANNE'S ATTENTION AND SHE WAS BEGINNING TO DESCRIBE HER OWN ADMIRATION OF THESE SCENES
198-129977-0006 WHEN EDWARD INTERRUPTED HER BY SAYING YOU MUST NOT ENQUIRE TOO FAR MARIANNE REMEMBER I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE IN THE PICTURESQUE AND I SHALL OFFEND YOU BY MY IGNORANCE AND WANT OF TASTE IF WE COME TO PARTICULARS
198-129977-0007 WHICH OUGHT TO BE IRREGULAR AND RUGGED AND DISTANT OBJECTS OUT OF SIGHT WHICH OUGHT ONLY TO BE INDISTINCT THROUGH THE SOFT MEDIUM OF A HAZY ATMOSPHERE YOU MUST BE SATISFIED WITH SUCH ADMIRATION AS I CAN HONESTLY GIVE I CALL IT A VERY FINE COUNTRY
198-129977-0008 THE HILLS ARE STEEP THE WOODS SEEM FULL OF FINE TIMBER
198-129977-0009 I CAN EASILY BELIEVE IT TO BE FULL OF ROCKS AND PROMONTORIES GREY MOSS AND BRUSH WOOD BUT THESE ARE ALL LOST ON ME I KNOW NOTHING OF THE PICTURESQUE
198-129977-0010 I AM AFRAID IT IS BUT TOO TRUE SAID MARIANNE BUT WHY SHOULD YOU BOAST OF IT I SUSPECT SAID ELINOR THAT TO AVOID ONE KIND OF AFFECTATION EDWARD HERE FALLS INTO ANOTHER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES MANY PEOPLE PRETEND TO MORE ADMIRATION OF THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE THAN THEY REALLY FEEL
198-129977-0011 AND IS DISGUSTED WITH SUCH PRETENSIONS HE AFFECTS GREATER INDIFFERENCE AND LESS DISCRIMINATION IN VIEWING THEM HIMSELF THAN HE POSSESSES HE IS FASTIDIOUS AND WILL HAVE AN AFFECTATION OF HIS OWN IT IS VERY TRUE SAID MARIANNE THAT ADMIRATION OF LANDSCAPE SCENERY
198-129977-0012 IS BECOME A MERE JARGON EVERY BODY PRETENDS TO FEEL AND TRIES TO DESCRIBE WITH THE TASTE AND ELEGANCE OF HIM WHO FIRST DEFINED WHAT PICTURESQUE BEAUTY WAS I DETEST JARGON OF EVERY KIND AND SOMETIMES I HAVE KEPT MY FEELINGS TO MYSELF
198-129977-0013 BECAUSE I COULD FIND NO LANGUAGE TO DESCRIBE THEM IN BUT WHAT WAS WORN AND HACKNEYED OUT OF ALL SENSE AND MEANING I AM CONVINCED SAID EDWARD THAT YOU REALLY FEEL ALL THE DELIGHT IN A FINE PROSPECT WHICH YOU PROFESS TO FEEL
198-129977-0014 BUT IN RETURN YOUR SISTER MUST ALLOW ME TO FEEL NO MORE THAN I PROFESS I LIKE A FINE PROSPECT BUT NOT ON PICTURESQUE PRINCIPLES I DO NOT LIKE CROOKED TWISTED BLASTED TREES I ADMIRE THEM MUCH MORE IF THEY ARE TALL STRAIGHT AND FLOURISHING
198-129977-0015 I DO NOT LIKE RUINED TATTERED COTTAGES I AM NOT FOND OF NETTLES OR THISTLES OR HEATH BLOSSOMS I HAVE MORE PLEASURE IN A SNUG FARM HOUSE THAN A WATCH TOWER
198-129977-0016 MARIANNE LOOKED WITH AMAZEMENT AT EDWARD WITH COMPASSION AT HER SISTER
198-129977-0017 TILL A NEW OBJECT SUDDENLY ENGAGED HER ATTENTION SHE WAS SITTING BY EDWARD AND IN TAKING HIS TEA FROM MISSUS DASHWOOD HIS HAND PASSED SO DIRECTLY BEFORE HER AS TO MAKE A RING WITH A PLAIT OF HAIR IN THE CENTRE VERY CONSPICUOUS ON ONE OF HIS FINGERS
198-129977-0018 BUT I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT HER HAIR HAD BEEN DARKER MARIANNE SPOKE INCONSIDERATELY WHAT SHE REALLY FELT BUT WHEN SHE SAW HOW MUCH SHE HAD PAINED EDWARD HER OWN VEXATION AT HER WANT OF THOUGHT COULD NOT BE SURPASSED BY HIS
198-129977-0019 HE COLOURED VERY DEEPLY AND GIVING A MOMENTARY GLANCE AT ELINOR REPLIED YES IT IS MY SISTER'S HAIR THE SETTING ALWAYS CASTS A DIFFERENT SHADE ON IT YOU KNOW ELINOR HAD MET HIS EYE AND LOOKED CONSCIOUS LIKEWISE
198-129977-0020 THAT THE HAIR WAS HER OWN SHE INSTANTANEOUSLY FELT AS WELL SATISFIED AS MARIANNE THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THEIR CONCLUSIONS WAS THAT WHAT MARIANNE CONSIDERED AS A FREE GIFT FROM HER SISTER ELINOR WAS CONSCIOUS MUST HAVE BEEN PROCURED BY SOME THEFT OR CONTRIVANCE UNKNOWN TO HERSELF
198-129977-0021 SHE WAS NOT IN A HUMOUR HOWEVER TO REGARD IT AS AN AFFRONT AND AFFECTING TO TAKE NO NOTICE OF WHAT PASSED BY INSTANTLY TALKING OF SOMETHING ELSE SHE INTERNALLY RESOLVED HENCEFORWARD TO CATCH EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EYEING THE HAIR AND OF SATISFYING HERSELF BEYOND ALL DOUBT
198-129977-0022 THAT IT WAS EXACTLY THE SHADE OF HER OWN EDWARD'S EMBARRASSMENT LASTED SOME TIME AND IT ENDED IN AN ABSENCE OF MIND STILL MORE SETTLED HE WAS PARTICULARLY GRAVE THE WHOLE MORNING MARIANNE SEVERELY CENSURED HERSELF FOR WHAT SHE HAD SAID
198-129977-0023 BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY THEY WERE VISITED BY SIR JOHN AND MISSUS JENNINGS WHO HAVING HEARD OF THE ARRIVAL OF A GENTLEMAN AT THE COTTAGE CAME TO TAKE A SURVEY OF THE GUEST WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF HIS MOTHER IN LAW SIR JOHN WAS NOT LONG IN DISCOVERING
198-129977-0024 THAT THE NAME OF FERRARS BEGAN WITH AN F AND THIS PREPARED A FUTURE MINE OF RAILLERY AGAINST THE DEVOTED ELINOR WHICH NOTHING BUT THE NEWNESS OF THEIR ACQUAINTANCE WITH EDWARD COULD HAVE PREVENTED FROM BEING IMMEDIATELY SPRUNG
198-129977-0025 BUT AS IT WAS SHE ONLY LEARNED FROM SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT LOOKS HOW FAR THEIR PENETRATION FOUNDED ON MARGARET'S INSTRUCTIONS EXTENDED SIR JOHN NEVER CAME TO THE DASHWOODS WITHOUT EITHER INVITING THEM TO DINE AT THE PARK THE NEXT DAY OR TO DRINK TEA WITH THEM THAT EVENING
198-129977-0026 ON THE PRESENT OCCASION FOR THE BETTER ENTERTAINMENT OF THEIR VISITOR TOWARDS WHOSE AMUSEMENT HE FELT HIMSELF BOUND TO CONTRIBUTE HE WISHED TO ENGAGE THEM FOR BOTH YOU MUST DRINK TEA WITH US TO NIGHT SAID HE
198-129977-0027 MISSUS JENNINGS ENFORCED THE NECESSITY AND WHO KNOWS BUT YOU MAY RAISE A DANCE SAID SHE AND THAT WILL TEMPT YOU MISS MARIANNE A DANCE CRIED MARIANNE IMPOSSIBLE WHO IS TO DANCE WHO WHY YOURSELVES AND THE CAREYS AND WHITAKERS TO BE SURE
198-129977-0028 WHAT YOU THOUGHT NOBODY COULD DANCE BECAUSE A CERTAIN PERSON THAT SHALL BE NAMELESS IS GONE I WISH WITH ALL MY SOUL CRIED SIR JOHN THAT WILLOUGHBY WERE AMONG US AGAIN THIS AND MARIANNE'S BLUSHING GAVE NEW SUSPICIONS TO EDWARD
198-129977-0029 AND WHO IS WILLOUGHBY SAID HE IN A LOW VOICE TO MISS DASHWOOD BY WHOM HE WAS SITTING SHE GAVE HIM A BRIEF REPLY
198-129977-0030 EDWARD SAW ENOUGH TO COMPREHEND NOT ONLY THE MEANING OF OTHERS BUT SUCH OF MARIANNE'S EXPRESSIONS AS HAD PUZZLED HIM BEFORE AND WHEN THEIR VISITORS LEFT THEM HE WENT IMMEDIATELY ROUND HER AND SAID IN A WHISPER I HAVE BEEN GUESSING SHALL I TELL YOU MY GUESS
198-129977-0031 WHAT DO YOU MEAN SHALL I TELL YOU CERTAINLY WELL THEN I GUESS THAT MISTER WILLOUGHBY HUNTS MARIANNE WAS SURPRISED AND CONFUSED YET SHE COULD NOT HELP SMILING AT THE QUIET ARCHNESS OF HIS MANNER AND AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE SAID
198-129977-0032 HOPE I AM SURE YOU WILL LIKE HIM
198-209-0000 MISSUS ALLEN SAID CATHERINE THE NEXT MORNING WILL THERE BE ANY HARM IN MY CALLING ON MISS TILNEY TODAY I SHALL NOT BE EASY TILL I HAVE EXPLAINED EVERYTHING GO BY ALL MEANS MY DEAR ONLY PUT ON A WHITE GOWN MISS TILNEY ALWAYS WEARS WHITE
198-209-0001 CATHERINE CHEERFULLY COMPLIED AND BEING PROPERLY EQUIPPED WAS MORE IMPATIENT THAN EVER TO BE AT THE PUMP ROOM THAT SHE MIGHT INFORM HERSELF OF GENERAL TILNEY'S LODGINGS FOR THOUGH SHE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN MILSOM STREET SHE WAS NOT CERTAIN OF THE HOUSE
198-209-0002 AND MISSUS ALLEN'S WAVERING CONVICTIONS ONLY MADE IT MORE DOUBTFUL TO MILSOM STREET SHE WAS DIRECTED AND HAVING MADE HERSELF PERFECT IN THE NUMBER HASTENED AWAY WITH EAGER STEPS AND A BEATING HEART TO PAY HER VISIT EXPLAIN HER CONDUCT AND BE FORGIVEN
198-209-0003 TRIPPING LIGHTLY THROUGH THE CHURCH YARD AND RESOLUTELY TURNING AWAY HER EYES THAT SHE MIGHT NOT BE OBLIGED TO SEE HER BELOVED ISABELLA AND HER DEAR FAMILY WHO SHE HAD REASON TO BELIEVE WERE IN A SHOP HARD BY SHE REACHED THE HOUSE WITHOUT ANY IMPEDIMENT LOOKED AT THE NUMBER
198-209-0004 AND WITH A LOOK WHICH DID NOT QUITE CONFIRM HIS WORDS SAID HE HAD BEEN MISTAKEN FOR THAT MISS TILNEY WAS WALKED OUT CATHERINE WITH A BLUSH OF MORTIFICATION LEFT THE HOUSE SHE FELT ALMOST PERSUADED THAT MISS TILNEY WAS AT HOME AND TOO MUCH OFFENDED TO ADMIT HER
198-209-0005 AND AS SHE RETIRED DOWN THE STREET COULD NOT WITHHOLD ONE GLANCE AT THE DRAWING ROOM WINDOWS IN EXPECTATION OF SEEING HER THERE
198-209-0006 AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STREET HOWEVER SHE LOOKED BACK AGAIN AND THEN NOT AT A WINDOW BUT ISSUING FROM THE DOOR SHE SAW MISS TILNEY HERSELF SHE WAS FOLLOWED BY A GENTLEMAN WHOM CATHERINE BELIEVED TO BE HER FATHER AND THEY TURNED UP TOWARDS EDGAR'S BUILDINGS
198-209-0007 CATHERINE IN DEEP MORTIFICATION PROCEEDED ON HER WAY SHE COULD ALMOST BE ANGRY HERSELF AT SUCH ANGRY INCIVILITY BUT SHE CHECKED THE RESENTFUL SENSATION SHE REMEMBERED HER OWN IGNORANCE SHE KNEW NOT HOW SUCH AN OFFENCE AS HERS MIGHT BE CLASSED BY THE LAWS OF WORLDLY POLITENESS
198-209-0008 TO WHAT A DEGREE OF UNFORGIVINGNESS IT MIGHT WITH PROPRIETY LEAD NOR TO WHAT RIGOURS OF RUDENESS IN RETURN IT MIGHT JUSTLY MAKE HER AMENABLE DEJECTED AND HUMBLED SHE HAD EVEN SOME THOUGHTS OF NOT GOING WITH THE OTHERS TO THE THEATRE THAT NIGHT
198-209-0009 FOR SHE SOON RECOLLECTED IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT SHE WAS WITHOUT ANY EXCUSE FOR STAYING AT HOME AND IN THE SECOND
198-209-0010 TO THE THEATRE ACCORDINGLY THEY ALL WENT NO TILNEYS APPEARED TO PLAGUE OR PLEASE HER SHE FEARED THAT AMONGST THE MANY PERFECTIONS OF THE FAMILY A FONDNESS FOR PLAYS WAS NOT TO BE RANKED BUT PERHAPS IT WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE HABITUATED TO THE FINER PERFORMANCES OF THE LONDON STAGE
198-209-0011 ON THE BEGINNING OF THE FIFTH HOWEVER THE SUDDEN VIEW OF MISTER HENRY TILNEY AND HIS FATHER JOINING A PARTY IN THE OPPOSITE BOX RECALLED HER TO ANXIETY AND DISTRESS THE STAGE COULD NO LONGER EXCITE GENUINE MERRIMENT NO LONGER KEEP HER WHOLE ATTENTION
198-209-0012 EVERY OTHER LOOK UPON AN AVERAGE WAS DIRECTED TOWARDS THE OPPOSITE BOX AND FOR THE SPACE OF TWO ENTIRE SCENES DID SHE THUS WATCH HENRY TILNEY WITHOUT BEING ONCE ABLE TO CATCH HIS EYE NO LONGER COULD HE BE SUSPECTED OF INDIFFERENCE FOR A PLAY
198-209-0013 HIS NOTICE WAS NEVER WITHDRAWN FROM THE STAGE DURING TWO WHOLE SCENES
198-209-0014 AND FORCED HIM TO HEAR HER EXPLANATION FEELINGS RATHER NATURAL THAN HEROIC POSSESSED HER INSTEAD OF CONSIDERING HER OWN DIGNITY INJURED BY THIS READY CONDEMNATION INSTEAD OF PROUDLY RESOLVING IN CONSCIOUS INNOCENCE
198-209-0015 TO SHOW HER RESENTMENT TOWARDS HIM WHO COULD HARBOUR A DOUBT OF IT TO LEAVE TO HIM ALL THE TROUBLE OF SEEKING AN EXPLANATION AND TO ENLIGHTEN HIM ON THE PAST ONLY BY AVOIDING HIS SIGHT OR FLIRTING WITH SOMEBODY ELSE SHE TOOK TO HERSELF ALL THE SHAME OF MISCONDUCT
198-209-0016 OR AT LEAST OF ITS APPEARANCE AND WAS ONLY EAGER FOR AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING ITS CAUSE THE PLAY CONCLUDED THE CURTAIN FELL HENRY TILNEY WAS NO LONGER TO BE SEEN WHERE HE HAD HITHERTO SAT BUT HIS FATHER REMAINED
198-209-0017 AND PERHAPS HE MIGHT BE NOW COMING ROUND TO THEIR BOX SHE WAS RIGHT IN A FEW MINUTES HE APPEARED
198-209-0018 YOU MUST HAVE THOUGHT ME SO RUDE BUT INDEED IT WAS NOT MY OWN FAULT WAS IT MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT THEY TELL ME THAT MISTER TILNEY AND HIS SISTER WERE GONE OUT IN A PHAETON TOGETHER AND THEN WHAT COULD I DO BUT I HAD TEN THOUSAND TIMES RATHER HAVE BEEN WITH YOU
198-209-0019 MY DEAR YOU TUMBLE MY GOWN WAS MISSUS ALLEN'S REPLY HER ASSURANCE HOWEVER STANDING SOLE AS IT DID WAS NOT THROWN AWAY IT BROUGHT A MORE CORDIAL MORE NATURAL SMILE INTO HIS COUNTENANCE
198-209-0020 AND HE REPLIED IN A TONE WHICH RETAINED ONLY A LITTLE AFFECTED RESERVE WE WERE MUCH OBLIGED TO YOU AT ANY RATE FOR WISHING US A PLEASANT WALK AFTER OUR PASSING YOU IN ARGYLE STREET YOU WERE SO KIND AS TO LOOK BACK ON PURPOSE
198-209-0021 BUT INDEED I DID NOT WISH YOU A PLEASANT WALK I NEVER THOUGHT OF SUCH A THING BUT I BEGGED MISTER THORPE SO EARNESTLY TO STOP I CALLED OUT TO HIM AS SOON AS EVER I SAW YOU NOW MISSUS ALLEN DID NOT OH YOU WERE NOT THERE BUT INDEED I DID AND IF MISTER THORPE WOULD ONLY HAVE STOPPED
198-209-0022 I WOULD HAVE JUMPED OUT AND RUN AFTER YOU IS THERE A HENRY IN THE WORLD WHO COULD BE INSENSIBLE TO SUCH A DECLARATION HENRY TILNEY AT LEAST WAS NOT WITH A YET SWEETER SMILE HE SAID EVERYTHING THAT NEED BE SAID OF HIS SISTER'S CONCERN REGRET
198-209-0023 AND DEPENDENCE ON CATHERINE'S HONOUR OH DO NOT SAY MISS TILNEY WAS NOT ANGRY CRIED CATHERINE BECAUSE I KNOW SHE WAS FOR SHE WOULD NOT SEE ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CALLED I SAW HER WALK OUT OF THE HOUSE THE NEXT MINUTE AFTER MY LEAVING IT I WAS HURT BUT I WAS NOT AFFRONTED
198-209-0024 PERHAPS YOU DID NOT KNOW I HAD BEEN THERE I WAS NOT WITHIN AT THE TIME BUT I HEARD OF IT FROM ELEANOR AND SHE HAS BEEN WISHING EVER SINCE TO SEE YOU TO EXPLAIN THE REASON OF SUCH INCIVILITY BUT PERHAPS I CAN DO IT AS WELL IT WAS NOTHING MORE THAN THAT MY FATHER
198-209-0025 AND HE BEING HURRIED FOR TIME AND NOT CARING TO HAVE IT PUT OFF MADE A POINT OF HER BEING DENIED THAT WAS ALL I DO ASSURE YOU
198-209-0026 AND MEANT TO MAKE HER APOLOGY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE CATHERINE'S MIND WAS GREATLY EASED BY THIS INFORMATION YET A SOMETHING OF SOLICITUDE REMAINED FROM WHICH SPRANG THE FOLLOWING QUESTION THOROUGHLY ARTLESS IN ITSELF THOUGH RATHER DISTRESSING TO THE GENTLEMAN BUT MISTER TILNEY
198-209-0027 WHY WERE YOU LESS GENEROUS THAN YOUR SISTER IF SHE FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE IN MY GOOD INTENTIONS AND COULD SUPPOSE IT TO BE ONLY A MISTAKE WHY SHOULD YOU BE SO READY TO TAKE OFFENCE ME I TAKE OFFENCE
198-209-0028 NAY I AM SURE BY YOUR LOOK WHEN YOU CAME INTO THE BOX YOU WERE ANGRY I ANGRY I COULD HAVE NO RIGHT WELL NOBODY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU HAD NO RIGHT WHO SAW YOUR FACE HE REPLIED BY ASKING HER TO MAKE ROOM FOR HIM AND TALKING OF THE PLAY HE REMAINED WITH THEM SOME TIME
198-209-0029 AND WAS ONLY TOO AGREEABLE FOR CATHERINE TO BE CONTENTED WHEN HE WENT AWAY BEFORE THEY PARTED HOWEVER IT WAS AGREED THAT THE PROJECTED WALK SHOULD BE TAKEN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND SETTING ASIDE THE MISERY OF HIS QUITTING THEIR BOX
198-209-0030 SHE WAS UPON THE WHOLE LEFT ONE OF THE HAPPIEST CREATURES IN THE WORLD WHILE TALKING TO EACH OTHER
198-209-0031 WAS ENGAGED IN CONVERSATION WITH GENERAL TILNEY
198-209-0032 WHAT COULD THEY HAVE TO SAY OF HER SHE FEARED GENERAL TILNEY DID NOT LIKE HER APPEARANCE SHE FOUND IT WAS IMPLIED IN HIS PREVENTING HER ADMITTANCE TO HIS DAUGHTER RATHER THAN POSTPONE HIS OWN WALK A FEW MINUTES HOW CAME MISTER THORPE TO KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS HER ANXIOUS INQUIRY
198-209-0033 AS SHE POINTED THEM OUT TO HER COMPANION HE KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT BUT HIS FATHER LIKE EVERY MILITARY MAN
198-209-0034 WHEN THE ENTERTAINMENT WAS OVER THORPE CAME TO ASSIST THEM IN GETTING OUT CATHERINE WAS THE IMMEDIATE OBJECT OF HIS GALLANTRY AND WHILE THEY WAITED IN THE LOBBY FOR A CHAIR HE PREVENTED THE INQUIRY WHICH HAD TRAVELLED FROM HER HEART ALMOST TO THE TIP OF HER TONGUE BY ASKING
198-209-0035 IN A CONSEQUENTIAL MANNER WHETHER SHE HAD SEEN HIM TALKING WITH GENERAL TILNEY HE IS A FINE OLD FELLOW UPON MY SOUL STOUT ACTIVE LOOKS AS YOUNG AS HIS SON I HAVE A GREAT REGARD FOR HIM I ASSURE YOU
198-209-0036 KNOW HIM THERE ARE FEW PEOPLE MUCH ABOUT TOWN THAT I DO NOT KNOW I HAVE MET HIM FOREVER AT THE BEDFORD AND I KNEW HIS FACE AGAIN TODAY THE MOMENT HE CAME INTO THE BILLIARD ROOM ONE OF THE BEST PLAYERS WE HAVE BY THE BY AND WE HAD A LITTLE TOUCH TOGETHER THOUGH I WAS ALMOST AFRAID OF HIM AT FIRST
198-209-0037 THE ODDS WERE FIVE TO FOUR AGAINST ME AND IF I HAD NOT MADE ONE OF THE CLEANEST STROKES THAT PERHAPS EVER WAS MADE IN THIS WORLD I TOOK HIS BALL EXACTLY BUT I COULD NOT MAKE YOU UNDERSTAND IT WITHOUT A TABLE HOWEVER I DID BEAT HIM A VERY FINE FELLOW AS RICH AS A JEW
198-209-0038 LOWERING HIS VOICE WELL DONE GENERAL SAID I I AM QUITE OF YOUR MIND
1992-141719-0000 THE QUEEN WAS RECEIV'D AT BABYLON WITH ALL THE TRANSPORTS OF JOY THAT COULD POSSIBLY BE EXPRESS'D FOR THE SAFE RETURN OF SO ILLUSTRIOUS AND SO BEAUTIFUL A PERSONAGE THAT HAD RUN THRO SUCH A LONG SERIES OF MISFORTUNES

1992-141719-0007 IN ORDER THAT HE WHO SHOULD REMAIN MASTER OF THE FIELD SHOULD BE PROCLAIM'D THE HAPPY VICTOR FOUR DAYS AFTERWARDS THEY WERE TO MEET AGAIN ACCOUTRED AS BEFORE
1992-141719-0008 AND TO EXPLAIN ALL SUCH A ENIGMAS OR RIDDLES AS THE MAGI SHOULD THINK PROPER TO PROPOSE IF THEIR QUERIES SHOULD PROVE TOO INTRICATE AND PERPLEXT FOR THEM TO RESOLVE THEY WERE TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE LISTS AGAIN AND AFTER THAT TO FRESH A ENIGMAS
1992-141719-0009 BEFORE THEY COULD BE ENTITLED TO THE ELECTION SO THAT THE TOURNAMENTS WERE TO BE CONTINU'D TILL ONE OF THE CANDIDATES SHOULD BE TWICE A VICTOR AND SHINE AS CONSPICUOUS WITH RESPECT TO HIS INTERNAL QUALITIES AS TO HIS DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS IN HEROIC ATCHIEVEMENTS
1992-141719-0010 THE QUEEN IN THE MEAN TIME WAS TO BE NARROWLY WATCH'D AND ALLOW'D ONLY TO BE A SPECTATOR OF BOTH THEIR AMUSEMENTS AT SOME CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE AND MOREOVER TO BE COVER'D WITH A VAIL
1992-141719-0011 NOR WAS SHE INDULG'D SO FAR AS TO SPEAK ONE SINGLE WORD TO ANY CANDIDATE WHOMSOEVER IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE LEAST JEALOUSY OR SUSPICION EITHER OF PARTIALITY OR INJUSTICE
1992-141719-0012 TO INFORM HER LOVER OF ALL THE PRELIMINARY ARTICLES ABOVEMENTION'D NOT DOUBTING BUT THAT HE WOULD EXERT BOTH HIS COURAGE AND UNDERSTANDING FOR HER SAKE BEYOND ANY OF THE OTHER COMPETITORS ZADIG ACCORDINGLY SET OUT FOR BABYLON AND BESOUGHT THE GODDESS VENUS
1992-141719-0013 NOT ONLY TO FORTIFY HIS COURAGE BUT TO ILLUMINATE HIS MIND WITH WISDOM ON THIS IMPORTANT OCCASION THE NIGHT BEFORE THESE MARTIAL ATCHIEVEMENTS WERE TO COMMENCE ZADIG ARRIVED UPON THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES
1992-141719-0014 HE INSCRIB'D HIS DEVICE AMONGST THE LIST OF COMBATANTS CONCEALING AT THE SAME TIME BOTH HIS PERSON AND NAME AS THE LAWS OF THE ELECTION REQUIRED AND ACCORDINGLY WITHDREW TO THE APARTMENT THAT WAS PROVIDED FOR HIM
1992-141719-0015 ACCORDING TO HIS LOT CADOR WHO WAS JUST RETURN'D TO BABYLON HAVING HUNTED ALL EGYPT OVER TO NO PURPOSE IN HOPES TO FIND HIS FRIEND ZADIG BROUGHT A COMPLEAT SET OF ARMOUR INTO HIS LODGE BY EXPRESS ORDERS FROM THE QUEEN
1992-141719-0016 SHE SENT HIM LIKEWISE ONE OF THE FINEST HORSES IN ALL PERSIA
1992-141719-0017 WHICH REDOUBLED HIS VIGOUR AND HIS HOPES THE NEXT MORNING THE QUEEN BEING SEATED UNDER A CANOPY OF STATE ENRICH'D WITH PRECIOUS STONES AND THE AMPHITHEATRES BEING CROWDED WITH GENTLEMEN AND LADIES OF ALL RANKS AND CONDITIONS FROM BABYLON
1992-141719-0018 THE COMPETITORS MADE THEIR PERSONAL APPEARANCE IN THE CIRCUS EACH OF THEM WENT UP TO THE GRAND MAGUS AND LAID DOWN HIS PARTICULAR DEVICE AT HIS FEET THE DEVICES WERE DRAWN BY LOT THAT OF ZADIG WAS THE LAST
1992-141719-0019 ONE ITABOD BY NAME IMMENSELY RICH INDEED AND VERY HAUGHTY
1992-141719-0020 EXCEEDINGLY AWKWARD AND A MAN OF NO ACQUIR'D PARTS THE SYCOPHANTS THAT HOVER'D ROUND ABOUT HIM FLATTER'D HIM THAT A MAN OF HIS MERIT COULDN'T FAIL OF BEING KING HE IMPERIOUSLY REPLIED ONE OF MY MERIT MUST BE KING
1992-141719-0021 HIS ARMOUR WAS MADE OF PURE GOLD ENAMELL'D WITH GREEN THE HOUSINGS OF HIS SADDLE WERE GREEN AND HIS LANCE EMBELLISH'D WITH GREEN RIBBANDS EVERY ONE WAS SENSIBLE AT FIRST SIGHT
1992-141719-0022 BY ITOBAD'S MANNER OF MANAGING HIS HORSE THAT HE WAS NOT THE MAN WHOM HEAV'N HAD PITCH'D UPON TO SWAY THE BABYLONISH SCEPTER THE FIRST COMBATANT THAT TILTED WITH HIM THREW HIM OUT OF THE SADDLE THE SECOND FLUNG HIM QUITE OVER THE CRUPPER
1992-141719-0023 AND LAID HIM SPRAWLING ON THE GROUND WITH HIS HEELS QUIV'RING IN THE AIR ITOBAD TIS TRUE REMOUNTED BUT WITH SO ILL A GRACE
1992-141719-0024 THE THIRD DISDAINING TO USE HIS LANCE MADE ONLY A FEINT AT HIM THEN CATCH'D HOLD OF HIS RIGHT LEG AND WHIRLING HIM ROUND THREW HIM FLAT UPON THE SAND THE ESQUIRES WHO WERE THE ATTENDANTS RAN TO HIS ASSISTANCE
1992-141719-0025 AND WITH A SNEER REMOUNTED HIM THE FOURTH COMBATANT CATCH'D HOLD OF HIS LEFT LEG AND UNHORS'D HIM AGAIN HE WAS CONVEY'D THRO THE HISSING MULTITUDE TO HIS LODGE WHERE ACCORDING TO THE LAW IN THAT CASE PROVIDED HE WAS TO PASS THE NIGHT
1992-141719-0026 AND AS HE HOBBLED ALONG SAID HE TO THE ESQUIRES WHAT A SAD MISFORTUNE IS THIS TO ONE OF MY BIRTH AND CHARACTER THE OTHER CHAMPIONS PLAY'D THEIR PARTS MUCH BETTER AND ALL CAME OFF WITH CREDIT
1992-141719-0027 SOME CONQUER'D TWO OF THEIR ANTAGONISTS AND OTHERS WERE SO FAR SUCCESSFUL AS TO GET THE BETTER OF THREE NONE OF THEM HOWEVER EXCEPT PRINCE HOTTAM VANQUISH'D FOUR ZADIG AT LAST
1992-141719-0028 ONE AFTER THE OTHER WITH THE UTMOST EASE AND WITH SUCH AN AIR AND GRACE AS GAIN'D HIM UNIVERSAL APPLAUSE AS THE CASE STOOD THUS ZADIG AND HOTTAM WERE TO CLOSE THE DAY'S ENTERTAINMENT IN A SINGLE COMBAT
1992-141719-0029 THE ARMOUR OF THE LATTER WAS OF A BLUE COLOUR MIXT WITH GOLD AND THE HOUSINGS OF HIS SADDLE WERE OF THE SAME THOSE OF THE FORMER WHITE AS SNOW THE MULTITUDE WERE DIVIDED IN THEIR WISHES THE KNIGHT IN BLUE WAS THE FAVOURITE OF SOME OF THE LADIES
1992-141719-0030 THE QUEEN WHOSE HEART WAS IN A PERFECT PALPITATION PUT UP HER SECRET PRAYERS TO VENUS TO ASSIST HER DARLING HERO THE TWO CHAMPIONS MAKING THEIR PASSES AND THEIR VOLTA'S WITH THE UTMOST DEXTERITY AND ADDRESS
1992-141719-0031 AND KEEPING FIRM IN THEIR SADDLES GAVE EACH OTHER SUCH REBUFFS WITH THEIR LANCES THAT ALL THE SPECTATORS THE QUEEN ONLY EXCEPTED WISH'D FOR TWO KINGS OF BABYLON AT LAST THEIR HORSES BEING TIRED AND BOTH THEIR LANCES BROKE
1992-141719-0032 ZADIG MADE USE OF THE FOLLOWING STRATAGEM
1992-141719-0033 HE GOT ARTFULLY BEHIND HIM AND SHOOTING WITH A SPRING ON HIS HORSES BUTTOCKS GRASP'D HIM CLOSE THREW HIM HEADLONG ON THE SAND THEN JUMP'D INTO HIS SEAT AND WHEEL'D ROUND PRINCE HOTTAM WHILE HE LAY SPRAWLING ON THE GROUND ALL THE SPECTATORS IN GENERAL
1992-141719-0034 WITH LOUD ACCLAMATIONS CRIED OUT VICTORY VICTORY IN FAVOUR OF THE CHAMPION IN WHITE
1992-141719-0035 INCENS'D TO THE LAST DEGREE GOT UP AND DREW HIS SWORD ZADIG SPRANG FROM HIS HORSE WITH HIS SABRE IN HIS HAND NOW BEHOLD THE TWO CHIEFTAINS UPON THEIR LEGS COMMENCING A NEW TRIAL OF SKILL WHERE THEY SEEM'D TO GET THE BETTER OF EACH OTHER ALTERNATELY
1992-141719-0036 FOR BOTH WERE STRONG AND BOTH WERE ACTIVE THE FEATHERS OF THEIR HELMETS THE STUDS OF THEIR BRACELETS THEIR COATS OF MAIL FLEW ABOUT IN PIECES THRO THE DRY BLOWS WHICH THEY A THOUSAND TIMES REPEATED THEY STRUCK AT EACH OTHER SOMETIMES WITH THE EDGE OF THEIR SWORDS
1992-141719-0037 AT OTHER TIMES THEY PUSH'D AS OCCASION OFFER'D NOW ON THE RIGHT THEN ON THE LEFT NOW ON THE HEAD THEN AT THE BREAST THEY RETREATED THEY ADVANC'D THEY KEPT AT A DISTANCE THEY CLOS'D AGAIN
1992-141719-0038 THEIR SWORDS STRUCK FIRE ALMOST AT EVERY BLOW AT LAST ZADIG IN ORDER TO RECOVER HIS BREATH FOR A MOMENT OR TWO STOOD STILL AND AFTERWARDS MAKING A FEINT AT THE PRINCE THREW HIM ON HIS BACK AND DISARM'D HIM HOTTAM THEREUPON
1992-141719-0039 CRIED OUT O THOU KNIGHT OF THE WHITE ARMOUR TIS YOU ONLY ARE DESTIN'D TO BE THE KING OF BABYLON THE QUEEN WAS PERFECTLY TRANSPORTED THE TWO CHAMPIONS WERE RECONDUCTED TO THEIR SEPARATE LODGES AS THE OTHERS HAD BEEN BEFORE THEM IN CONFORMITY TO THE LAWS PRESCRIB'D
1992-141719-0040 SEVERAL MUTES WERE ORDER'D TO WAIT ON THE CHAMPIONS AND CARRY THEM SOME PROPER REFRESHMENT WE'LL LEAVE THE READER TO JUDGE WHETHER THE QUEEN'S DWARF WAS NOT APPOINTED TO WAIT ON ZADIG ON THIS HAPPY OCCASION AFTER SUPPER THE MUTES WITHDREW
1992-141719-0041 AND LEFT THE COMBATANTS TO REST THEIR WEARIED LIMBS TILL THE NEXT MORNING AT WHICH TIME THE VICTOR WAS TO PRODUCE HIS DEVICE BEFORE THE GRAND MAGUS IN ORDER TO CONFER NOTES AND DISCOVER THE HERO WHOEVER HE MIGHT BE ZADIG SLEPT VERY SOUND
1992-141719-0042 NOTWITHSTANDING HIS AMOROUS REGARD FOR THE QUEEN BEING PERFECTLY FATIGU'D ITABOD WHO LAY IN THE LODGE CONTIGUOUS TO HIS COULD NOT ONCE CLOSE HIS EYES FOR VEXATION HE GOT UP THEREFORE IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT STOLE IMPERCEPTIBLY INTO ZADIG'S APARTMENT
1992-141719-0043 TOOK HIS WHITE ARMOUR AND DEVICE AWAY WITH HIM AND SUBSTITUTED HIS GREEN ONE IN ITS PLACE AS SOON AS THE DAY BEGAN TO DAWN HE REPAIR'D WITH A SEEMINGLY UNDAUNTED COURAGE TO THE GRAND MAGUS TO INFORM HIM THAT HE WAS THE MIGHTY HERO THE HAPPY VICTOR
1992-141719-0044 AND WAS PROCLAIM'D VICTOR BEFORE ZADIG WAS AWAKE
1992-141719-0045 RETURN'D WITH A HEART OVERWHELM'D WITH DESPAIR TO THE COURT OF BABYLON
1992-141719-0046 HE WAS OBLIG'D THO SORELY AGAINST HIS WILL TO PUT IT ON HAVING NOTHING ELSE IN HIS LODGE TO APPEAR IN CONFOUNDED AND BIG WITH RESENTMENT
1992-141719-0047 THE POPULACE THAT WERE LEFT BEHIND IN THE CIRCUS HISS'D HIM EVERY STEP HE TOOK THEY MADE A RING ABOUT HIM AND TREATED HIM WITH ALL THE MARKS OF IGNOMINY AND CONTEMPT THE MOST COWARDLY WRETCH BREATHING WAS NEVER SURE SO SWEATED OR HUNTED DOWN AS POOR ZADIG
1992-141719-0048 HE GREW QUITE OUT OF PATIENCE AT LAST AND CUT HIS WAY THRO THE INSULTING MOB WITH HIS RIVAL'S SABRE BUT HE DID NOT KNOW WHAT MEASURES TO PURSUE OR HOW TO RECTIFY SO GROSS A MISTAKE IT WAS NOT IN HIS POWER TO HAVE A SIGHT OF THE QUEEN
1992-141719-0049 HE COULD NEVER RECOVER THE WHITE ARMOUR AGAIN WHICH SHE HAD SENT HIM THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE OR THE ENGAGEMENT TO WHICH THE COMBATANTS HAD ALL UNANIMOUSLY AGREED THUS AS HE WAS ON THE ONE HAND PLUNG'D IN AN ABYSS OF SORROW
1992-141719-0050 SO ON THE OTHER HE WAS ALMOST DROVE DISTRACTED WITH VEXATION AND RESENTMENT HE WITHDREW THEREFORE IN A SOLITARY MOOD TO THE BANKS OF THE EUPHRATES NOW FULLY PERSUADED
1992-141719-0051 THAT HIS IMPROPITIOUS STAR HAD SHED ITS MOST BALEFUL INFLUENCE ON HIM AND THAT HIS MISFORTUNES WERE IRRETRIEVABLE REVOLVING IN HIS MIND ALL HIS DISAPPOINTMENTS FROM HIS FIRST ADVENTURE WITH THE COURT COQUET
1992-141719-0052 DOWN TO HIS LATE LOSS OF HIS WHITE ARMOUR SEE SAID HE THE FATAL CONSEQUENCE OF BEING A SLUGGARD
1992-141719-0053 ALL THE KNOWLEDGE OF BOOKS OR MANKIND ALL THE PERSONAL VALOUR THAT I CAN BOAST OF HAS ONLY PROV'D AN AGGRAVATION OF MY SORROWS HE CARRIED THE POINT SO FAR AT LAST AS TO MURMUR AT THE UNEQUAL DISPENSATIONS OF DIVINE PROVIDENCE
1992-141719-0054 AND WAS TEMPTED TO BELIEVE THAT ALL OCCURRENCES WERE GOVERN'D BY A MALIGNANT DESTINY WHICH NEVER FAIL'D TO OPPRESS THE VIRTUOUS AND ALWAYS CROWN'D THE ACTIONS OF SUCH VILLAINS AS THE GREEN KNIGHT WITH UNCOMMON SUCCESS IN ONE OF HIS FRANTICK FITS
1992-141719-0055 HE PUT ON THE GREEN ARMOUR THAT HAD CREATED HIM SUCH A WORLD OF DISGRACE A MERCHANT HAPPENING TO PASS BY HE SOLD IT TO HIM FOR A TRIFLE AND TOOK IN EXCHANGE NOTHING MORE THAN A MANTLE AND A CAP
200-124139-0000 TO THE CIVIL INQUIRIES WHICH THEN POURED IN AND AMONGST WHICH SHE HAD THE PLEASURE OF DISTINGUISHING THE MUCH SUPERIOR SOLICITUDE OF MISTER BINGLEY'S SHE COULD NOT MAKE A VERY FAVOURABLE ANSWER JANE WAS BY NO MEANS BETTER
200-124139-0001 THE SISTERS ON HEARING THIS REPEATED THREE OR FOUR TIMES HOW MUCH THEY WERE GRIEVED HOW SHOCKING IT WAS TO HAVE A BAD COLD AND HOW EXCESSIVELY THEY DISLIKED BEING ILL THEMSELVES AND THEN THOUGHT NO MORE OF THE MATTER
200-124139-0002 AND THEIR INDIFFERENCE TOWARDS JANE WHEN NOT IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THEM RESTORED ELIZABETH TO THE ENJOYMENT OF ALL HER FORMER DISLIKE THEIR BROTHER INDEED WAS THE ONLY ONE OF THE PARTY WHOM SHE COULD REGARD WITH ANY COMPLACENCY
200-124139-0003 MISS BINGLEY WAS ENGROSSED BY MISTER DARCY HER SISTER SCARCELY LESS SO AND AS FOR MISTER HURST BY WHOM ELIZABETH SAT HE WAS AN INDOLENT MAN
200-124139-0004 WHO WHEN HE FOUND HER TO PREFER A PLAIN DISH TO A RAGOUT HAD NOTHING TO SAY TO HER WHEN DINNER WAS OVER SHE RETURNED DIRECTLY TO JANE AND MISS BINGLEY BEGAN ABUSING HER AS SOON AS SHE WAS OUT OF THE ROOM
200-124139-0005 SHE HAS NOTHING IN SHORT TO RECOMMEND HER BUT BEING AN EXCELLENT WALKER I SHALL NEVER FORGET HER APPEARANCE THIS MORNING SHE REALLY LOOKED ALMOST WILD SHE DID INDEED LOUISA
200-124139-0006 SIX INCHES DEEP IN MUD I AM ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN AND THE GOWN WHICH HAD BEEN LET DOWN TO HIDE IT NOT DOING ITS OFFICE YOUR PICTURE MAY BE VERY EXACT LOUISA SAID BINGLEY BUT THIS WAS ALL LOST UPON ME
200-124139-0007 CERTAINLY NOT TO WALK THREE MILES OR FOUR MILES OR FIVE MILES
200-124139-0008 SAID BINGLEY I AM AFRAID MISTER DARCY OBSERVED MISS BINGLEY IN A HALF WHISPER THAT THIS ADVENTURE HAS RATHER AFFECTED YOUR ADMIRATION OF HER FINE EYES
200-124139-0009 HE REPLIED THEY WERE BRIGHTENED BY THE EXERCISE A SHORT PAUSE FOLLOWED THIS SPEECH AND MISSUS HURST BEGAN AGAIN I HAVE AN EXCESSIVE REGARD FOR MISS JANE BENNET SHE IS REALLY A VERY SWEET GIRL
200-124139-0010 AND I WISH WITH ALL MY HEART SHE WERE WELL SETTLED BUT WITH SUCH A FATHER AND MOTHER AND SUCH LOW CONNECTIONS I AM AFRAID THERE IS NO CHANCE OF IT
200-124139-0011 YES AND THEY HAVE ANOTHER WHO LIVES SOMEWHERE NEAR CHEAPSIDE THAT IS CAPITAL ADDED HER SISTER AND THEY BOTH LAUGHED HEARTILY
200-124139-0012 IT WOULD NOT MAKE THEM ONE JOT LESS AGREEABLE BUT IT MUST VERY MATERIALLY LESSEN THEIR CHANCE OF MARRYING MEN OF ANY CONSIDERATION IN THE WORLD REPLIED DARCY TO THIS SPEECH BINGLEY MADE NO ANSWER
200-124139-0013 BUT HIS SISTERS GAVE IT THEIR HEARTY ASSENT AND INDULGED THEIR MIRTH FOR SOME TIME AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR DEAR FRIEND'S VULGAR RELATIONS
200-124139-0014 AND SAT WITH HER TILL SUMMONED TO COFFEE SHE WAS STILL VERY POORLY AND ELIZABETH WOULD NOT QUIT HER AT ALL TILL LATE IN THE EVENING WHEN SHE HAD THE COMFORT OF SEEING HER SLEEP AND WHEN IT SEEMED TO HER RATHER RIGHT THAN PLEASANT
200-124139-0015 THAT SHE SHOULD GO DOWNSTAIRS HERSELF ON ENTERING THE DRAWING ROOM SHE FOUND THE WHOLE PARTY AT LOO AND WAS IMMEDIATELY INVITED TO JOIN THEM BUT SUSPECTING THEM TO BE PLAYING HIGH SHE DECLINED IT
200-124139-0016 AND MAKING HER SISTER THE EXCUSE SAID SHE WOULD AMUSE HERSELF FOR THE SHORT TIME SHE COULD STAY BELOW WITH A BOOK MISTER HURST LOOKED AT HER WITH ASTONISHMENT DO YOU PREFER READING TO CARDS SAID HE THAT IS RATHER SINGULAR
200-124139-0017 MISS ELIZA BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY DESPISES CARDS SHE IS A GREAT READER AND HAS NO PLEASURE IN ANYTHING ELSE
200-124139-0018 HE IMMEDIATELY OFFERED TO FETCH HER OTHERS ALL THAT HIS LIBRARY AFFORDED AND I WISH MY COLLECTION WERE LARGER FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND MY OWN CREDIT BUT I AM AN IDLE FELLOW AND THOUGH I HAVE NOT MANY I HAVE MORE THAN I EVER LOOKED INTO
200-124139-0019 I AM ASTONISHED SAID MISS BINGLEY THAT MY FATHER SHOULD HAVE LEFT SO SMALL A COLLECTION OF BOOKS WHAT A DELIGHTFUL LIBRARY YOU HAVE AT PEMBERLEY MISTER DARCY IT OUGHT TO BE GOOD HE REPLIED
200-124139-0020 IT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MANY GENERATIONS
200-124139-0021 CHARLES WHEN YOU BUILD YOUR HOUSE
200-124139-0022 I WISH IT MAY BUT I WOULD REALLY ADVISE YOU TO MAKE YOUR PURCHASE IN THAT NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TAKE PEMBERLEY FOR A KIND OF MODEL THERE IS NOT A FINER COUNTY IN ENGLAND THAN DERBYSHIRE WITH ALL MY HEART
200-124139-0023 I WILL BUY PEMBERLEY ITSELF IF DARCY WILL SELL IT I AM TALKING OF POSSIBILITIES CHARLES UPON MY WORD CAROLINE I SHOULD THINK IT MORE POSSIBLE TO GET PEMBERLEY BY PURCHASE THAN BY IMITATION
200-124139-0024 SAID MISS BINGLEY WILL SHE BE AS TALL AS I AM I THINK SHE WILL SHE IS NOW ABOUT MISS ELIZABETH BENNET'S HEIGHT OR RATHER TALLER HOW I LONG TO SEE HER AGAIN I NEVER MET
200-124139-0025 WITH ANYBODY WHO DELIGHTED ME SO MUCH SUCH A COUNTENANCE SUCH MANNERS AND SO EXTREMELY ACCOMPLISHED FOR HER AGE HER PERFORMANCE ON THE PIANOFORTE IS EXQUISITE IT IS AMAZING TO ME SAID BINGLEY
200-124139-0026 THE WORD IS APPLIED TO MANY A WOMAN WHO DESERVES IT NO OTHERWISE THAN BY NETTING A PURSE OR COVERING A SCREEN BUT I AM VERY FAR FROM AGREEING WITH YOU IN YOUR ESTIMATION OF LADIES IN GENERAL
200-124139-0027 I CANNOT BOAST OF KNOWING MORE THAN HALF A DOZEN IN THE WHOLE RANGE OF MY ACQUAINTANCE THAT ARE REALLY ACCOMPLISHED NOR I I AM SURE SAID MISS BINGLEY THEN
200-124139-0028 OBSERVED ELIZABETH YOU MUST COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN YOUR IDEA OF AN ACCOMPLISHED WOMAN YES I DO COMPREHEND A GREAT DEAL IN IT
200-124139-0029 NO ONE CAN BE REALLY ESTEEMED ACCOMPLISHED WHO DOES NOT GREATLY SURPASS WHAT IS USUALLY MET WITH A WOMAN MUST HAVE A THOROUGH KNOWLEDGE OF MUSIC SINGING DRAWING DANCING AND THE MODERN LANGUAGES TO DESERVE THE WORD
200-124139-0030 ADDED DARCY AND TO ALL THIS SHE MUST YET ADD SOMETHING MORE SUBSTANTIAL IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF HER MIND BY EXTENSIVE READING I AM NO LONGER SURPRISED AT YOUR KNOWING ONLY SIX ACCOMPLISHED WOMEN
200-124139-0031 ARE YOU SO SEVERE UPON YOUR OWN SEX AS TO DOUBT THE POSSIBILITY OF ALL THIS I NEVER SAW SUCH A WOMAN I NEVER SAW SUCH CAPACITY AND TASTE AND APPLICATION AND ELEGANCE AS YOU DESCRIBE UNITED
200-124139-0032 MISSUS HURST AND MISS BINGLEY BOTH CRIED OUT AGAINST THE INJUSTICE OF HER IMPLIED DOUBT AND WERE BOTH PROTESTING THAT THEY KNEW MANY WOMEN WHO ANSWERED THIS DESCRIPTION WHEN MISTER HURST CALLED THEM TO ORDER
200-124139-0033 WITH BITTER COMPLAINTS OF THEIR INATTENTION TO WHAT WAS GOING FORWARD AS ALL CONVERSATION WAS THEREBY AT AN END ELIZABETH SOON AFTERWARDS LEFT THE ROOM ELIZABETH BENNET SAID MISS BINGLEY WHEN THE DOOR WAS CLOSED ON HER
200-124139-0034 A VERY MEAN ART UNDOUBTEDLY REPLIED DARCY TO WHOM THIS REMARK WAS CHIEFLY ADDRESSED THERE IS A MEANNESS IN ALL THE ARTS WHICH LADIES SOMETIMES CONDESCEND TO EMPLOY FOR CAPTIVATION
200-124139-0035 WHATEVER BEARS AFFINITY TO CUNNING IS DESPICABLE MISS BINGLEY WAS NOT SO ENTIRELY SATISFIED WITH THIS REPLY AS TO CONTINUE THE SUBJECT
200-124139-0036 ELIZABETH JOINED THEM AGAIN ONLY TO SAY THAT HER SISTER WAS WORSE AND THAT SHE COULD NOT LEAVE HER BINGLEY URGED MISTER JONES BEING SENT FOR IMMEDIATELY WHILE HIS SISTERS CONVINCED THAT NO COUNTRY ADVICE COULD BE OF ANY SERVICE
200-124139-0037 RECOMMENDED AN EXPRESS TO TOWN FOR ONE OF THE MOST EMINENT PHYSICIANS THIS SHE WOULD NOT HEAR OF BUT SHE WAS NOT SO UNWILLING TO COMPLY WITH THEIR BROTHER'S PROPOSAL AND IT WAS SETTLED THAT MISTER JONES SHOULD BE SENT FOR EARLY IN THE MORNING
200-124139-0038 IF MISS BENNET WERE NOT DECIDEDLY BETTER BINGLEY WAS QUITE UNCOMFORTABLE HIS SISTERS DECLARED THAT THEY WERE MISERABLE THEY SOLACED THEIR WRETCHEDNESS HOWEVER BY DUETS AFTER SUPPER
200-124140-0000 AND SOME TIME AFTERWARDS FROM THE TWO ELEGANT LADIES WHO WAITED ON HIS SISTERS IN SPITE OF THIS AMENDMENT HOWEVER SHE REQUESTED TO HAVE A NOTE SENT TO LONGBOURN DESIRING HER MOTHER TO VISIT JANE AND FORM HER OWN JUDGEMENT OF HER SITUATION
200-124140-0001 THE NOTE WAS IMMEDIATELY DISPATCHED AND ITS CONTENTS AS QUICKLY COMPLIED WITH MISSUS BENNET ACCOMPANIED BY HER TWO YOUNGEST GIRLS REACHED NETHERFIELD SOON AFTER THE FAMILY BREAKFAST HAD SHE FOUND JANE IN ANY APPARENT DANGER
200-124140-0002 SHE WOULD NOT LISTEN THEREFORE TO HER DAUGHTER'S PROPOSAL OF BEING CARRIED HOME NEITHER DID THE APOTHECARY WHO ARRIVED ABOUT THE SAME TIME THINK IT AT ALL ADVISABLE AFTER SITTING A LITTLE WHILE WITH JANE
200-124140-0003 ON MISS BINGLEY'S APPEARANCE AND INVITATION THE MOTHER AND THREE DAUGHTERS ALL ATTENDED HER INTO THE BREAKFAST PARLOUR BINGLEY MET THEM WITH HOPES THAT MISSUS BENNET HAD NOT FOUND MISS BENNET WORSE THAN SHE EXPECTED
200-124140-0004 INDEED I HAVE SIR WAS HER ANSWER SHE IS A GREAT DEAL TOO ILL TO BE MOVED MISTER JONES SAYS WE MUST NOT THINK OF MOVING HER WE MUST TRESPASS A LITTLE LONGER ON YOUR KINDNESS
200-124140-0005 REMOVED CRIED BINGLEY IT MUST NOT BE THOUGHT OF MY SISTER I AM SURE WILL NOT HEAR OF HER REMOVAL YOU MAY DEPEND UPON IT MADAM SAID MISS BINGLEY WITH COLD CIVILITY
200-124140-0006 YOU WILL NOT THINK OF QUITTING IT IN A HURRY I HOPE THOUGH YOU HAVE BUT A SHORT LEASE WHATEVER I DO IS DONE IN A HURRY REPLIED HE AND THEREFORE IF I SHOULD RESOLVE TO QUIT NETHERFIELD I SHOULD PROBABLY BE OFF IN FIVE MINUTES
200-124140-0007 AT PRESENT HOWEVER I CONSIDER MYSELF AS QUITE FIXED HERE THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I SHOULD HAVE SUPPOSED OF YOU SAID ELIZABETH YOU BEGIN TO COMPREHEND ME DO YOU CRIED HE TURNING TOWARDS HER
200-124140-0008 OH YES I UNDERSTAND YOU PERFECTLY I WISH I MIGHT TAKE THIS FOR A COMPLIMENT BUT TO BE SO EASILY SEEN THROUGH I AM AFRAID IS PITIFUL THAT IS AS IT HAPPENS
200-124140-0009 IT DOES NOT FOLLOW THAT A DEEP INTRICATE CHARACTER IS MORE OR LESS ESTIMABLE THAN SUCH A ONE AS YOURS LIZZY CRIED HER MOTHER REMEMBER WHERE YOU ARE AND DO NOT RUN ON IN THE WILD MANNER THAT YOU ARE SUFFERED TO DO AT HOME
200-124140-0010 I DID NOT KNOW BEFORE CONTINUED BINGLEY IMMEDIATELY THAT YOU WERE A STUDIER OF CHARACTER IT MUST BE AN AMUSING STUDY
200-124140-0011 THEY HAVE AT LEAST THAT ADVANTAGE THE COUNTRY SAID DARCY CAN IN GENERAL SUPPLY BUT A FEW SUBJECTS FOR SUCH A STUDY IN A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD YOU MOVE IN A VERY CONFINED AND UNVARYING SOCIETY
200-124140-0012 BUT PEOPLE THEMSELVES ALTER SO MUCH
200-124140-0013 OFFENDED BY HIS MANNER OF MENTIONING A COUNTRY NEIGHBOURHOOD I ASSURE YOU THERE IS QUITE AS MUCH OF THAT GOING ON IN THE COUNTRY AS IN TOWN EVERYBODY WAS SURPRISED AND DARCY AFTER LOOKING AT HER FOR A MOMENT
200-124140-0014 TURNED SILENTLY AWAY MISSUS BENNET WHO FANCIED SHE HAD GAINED A COMPLETE VICTORY OVER HIM CONTINUED HER TRIUMPH I CANNOT SEE THAT LONDON HAS ANY GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER THE COUNTRY FOR MY PART
200-124140-0015 THEY HAVE EACH THEIR ADVANTAGES AND I CAN BE EQUALLY HAPPY IN EITHER AYE THAT IS BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE RIGHT DISPOSITION BUT THAT GENTLEMAN LOOKING AT DARCY SEEMED TO THINK THE COUNTRY WAS NOTHING AT ALL
200-124140-0016 INDEED MAMMA YOU ARE MISTAKEN SAID ELIZABETH BLUSHING FOR HER MOTHER YOU QUITE MISTOOK MISTER DARCY HE ONLY MEANT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUCH A VARIETY OF PEOPLE TO BE MET WITH IN THE COUNTRY AS IN THE TOWN
200-124140-0017 WHICH YOU MUST ACKNOWLEDGE TO BE TRUE CERTAINLY MY DEAR NOBODY SAID THERE WERE BUT AS TO NOT MEETING WITH MANY PEOPLE IN THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I BELIEVE THERE ARE FEW NEIGHBOURHOODS LARGER I KNOW WE DINE WITH FOUR AND TWENTY FAMILIES
200-124140-0018 NOTHING BUT CONCERN FOR ELIZABETH COULD ENABLE BINGLEY TO KEEP HIS COUNTENANCE HIS SISTER WAS LESS DELICATE AND DIRECTED HER EYES TOWARDS MISTER DARCY WITH A VERY EXPRESSIVE SMILE
200-124140-0019 ELIZABETH FOR THE SAKE OF SAYING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT TURN HER MOTHER'S THOUGHTS NOW ASKED HER IF CHARLOTTE LUCAS HAD BEEN AT LONGBOURN SINCE HER COMING AWAY
200-124140-0020 SO MUCH THE MAN OF FASHION SO GENTEEL AND EASY HE HAS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO SAY TO EVERYBODY THAT IS MY IDEA OF GOOD BREEDING AND THOSE PERSONS WHO FANCY THEMSELVES VERY IMPORTANT
200-124140-0021 AND NEVER OPEN THEIR MOUTHS QUITE MISTAKE THE MATTER DID CHARLOTTE DINE WITH YOU NO SHE WOULD GO HOME I FANCY SHE WAS WANTED ABOUT THE MINCE PIES
200-124140-0022 FOR MY PART MISTER BINGLEY I ALWAYS KEEP SERVANTS THAT CAN DO THEIR OWN WORK MY DAUGHTERS ARE BROUGHT UP VERY DIFFERENTLY BUT EVERYBODY IS TO JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES AND THE LUCASES ARE A VERY GOOD SORT OF GIRLS I ASSURE YOU IT IS A PITY THEY ARE NOT HANDSOME
200-124140-0023 NOT THAT I THINK CHARLOTTE SO VERY PLAIN BUT THEN SHE IS OUR PARTICULAR FRIEND
200-124140-0024 I DO NOT TRUST MY OWN PARTIALITY WHEN SHE WAS ONLY FIFTEEN THERE WAS A MAN AT MY BROTHER GARDINER'S IN TOWN SO MUCH IN LOVE WITH HER THAT MY SISTER IN LAW WAS SURE HE WOULD MAKE HER AN OFFER BEFORE WE CAME AWAY
200-124140-0025 BUT HOWEVER HE DID NOT PERHAPS HE THOUGHT HER TOO YOUNG HOWEVER HE WROTE SOME VERSES ON HER AND VERY PRETTY THEY WERE AND SO ENDED HIS AFFECTION SAID ELIZABETH IMPATIENTLY
200-124140-0026 THERE HAS BEEN MANY A ONE I FANCY OVERCOME IN THE SAME WAY I WONDER WHO FIRST DISCOVERED THE EFFICACY OF POETRY IN DRIVING AWAY LOVE I HAVE BEEN USED TO CONSIDER POETRY AS THE FOOD OF LOVE SAID DARCY
200-124140-0027 OF A FINE STOUT HEALTHY LOVE IT MAY EVERYTHING NOURISHES WHAT IS STRONG ALREADY BUT IF IT BE ONLY A SLIGHT THIN SORT OF INCLINATION I AM CONVINCED THAT ONE GOOD SONNET WILL STARVE IT ENTIRELY AWAY
200-124140-0028 DARCY ONLY SMILED AND THE GENERAL PAUSE WHICH ENSUED MADE ELIZABETH TREMBLE LEST HER MOTHER SHOULD BE EXPOSING HERSELF AGAIN SHE LONGED TO SPEAK BUT COULD THINK OF NOTHING TO SAY
200-124140-0029 AND FORCED HIS YOUNGER SISTER TO BE CIVIL ALSO AND SAY WHAT THE OCCASION REQUIRED SHE PERFORMED HER PART INDEED WITHOUT MUCH GRACIOUSNESS BUT MISSUS BENNET WAS SATISFIED AND SOON AFTERWARDS ORDERED HER CARRIAGE UPON THIS SIGNAL
200-124140-0030 THE YOUNGEST OF HER DAUGHTERS PUT HERSELF FORWARD THE TWO GIRLS HAD BEEN WHISPERING TO EACH OTHER DURING THE WHOLE VISIT AND THE RESULT OF IT WAS THAT THE YOUNGEST SHOULD TAX MISTER BINGLEY WITH HAVING PROMISED ON HIS FIRST COMING INTO THE COUNTRY TO GIVE A BALL AT NETHERFIELD
200-124140-0031 LYDIA WAS A STOUT WELL GROWN GIRL OF FIFTEEN WITH A FINE COMPLEXION AND GOOD HUMOURED COUNTENANCE A FAVOURITE WITH HER MOTHER WHOSE AFFECTION HAD BROUGHT HER INTO PUBLIC AT AN EARLY AGE SHE HAD HIGH ANIMAL SPIRITS
200-124140-0032 AND A SORT OF NATURAL SELF CONSEQUENCE WHICH THE ATTENTION OF THE OFFICERS TO WHOM HER UNCLE'S GOOD DINNERS AND HER OWN EASY MANNERS RECOMMENDED HER HAD INCREASED INTO ASSURANCE
200-124140-0033 AND ABRUPTLY REMINDED HIM OF HIS PROMISE
200-124140-0034 HIS ANSWER TO THIS SUDDEN ATTACK WAS DELIGHTFUL TO THEIR MOTHER'S EAR I AM PERFECTLY READY I ASSURE YOU TO KEEP MY ENGAGEMENT AND WHEN YOUR SISTER IS RECOVERED YOU SHALL IF YOU PLEASE NAME THE VERY DAY OF THE BALL
200-124140-0035 BUT YOU WOULD NOT WISH TO BE DANCING WHEN SHE IS ILL LYDIA DECLARED HERSELF SATISFIED
200-124140-0036 AND BY THAT TIME MOST LIKELY CAPTAIN CARTER WOULD BE AT MERYTON AGAIN AND WHEN YOU HAVE GIVEN YOUR BALL SHE ADDED I SHALL INSIST ON THEIR GIVING ONE ALSO I SHALL TELL COLONEL FORSTER IT WILL BE QUITE A SHAME IF HE DOES NOT
200-124140-0037 MISSUS BENNET AND HER DAUGHTERS THEN DEPARTED AND ELIZABETH RETURNED INSTANTLY TO JANE LEAVING HER OWN AND HER RELATIONS BEHAVIOUR TO THE REMARKS OF THE TWO LADIES AND MISTER DARCY THE LATTER OF WHOM HOWEVER
200-124140-0038 COULD NOT BE PREVAILED ON TO JOIN IN THEIR CENSURE OF HER IN SPITE OF ALL MISS BINGLEY'S WITTICISMS ON

200-126784-0001 IN ESKE OR LIDDEL FORDS WERE NONE BUT HE WOULD RIDE THEM ONE BY ONE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIME OR TIDE DECEMBER'S SNOW OR JULY'S PRIDE ALIKE TO HIM WAS TIDE OR TIME MOONLESS MIDNIGHT OR MATIN PRIME
200-126784-0002 WALTER SCOTT ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE WHARTON FAMILY LAID THEIR HEADS ON THEIR PILLOWS THAT NIGHT WITH A FOREBODING OF SOME INTERRUPTION TO THEIR ORDINARY QUIET UNEASINESS KEPT THE SISTERS FROM ENJOYING THEIR USUAL REPOSE
200-126784-0003 AND THEY ROSE FROM THEIR BEDS ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING UNREFRESHED AND ALMOST WITHOUT HAVING CLOSED THEIR EYES ON TAKING AN EAGER AND HASTY SURVEY OF THE VALLEY FROM THE WINDOWS OF THEIR ROOM NOTHING HOWEVER BUT ITS USUAL SERENITY WAS TO BE SEEN
200-126784-0004 COMPOSE THE SEASON FOR ENJOYMENT IN THE OPEN AIR THEY HAVE THEIR STORMS BUT THEY ARE DISTINCT AND NOT OF LONG CONTINUANCE LEAVING A CLEAR ATMOSPHERE AND A CLOUDLESS SKY
200-126784-0005 THE SISTERS DESCENDED TO THE PARLOR WITH A RETURNING CONFIDENCE IN THEIR BROTHER'S SECURITY AND THEIR OWN HAPPINESS THE FAMILY WERE EARLY IN ASSEMBLING AROUND THE BREAKFAST TABLE AND MISS PEYTON WITH A LITTLE OF THAT MINUTE
200-126784-0006 HAD PLEASANTLY INSISTED THAT THE ABSENCE OF HER NEPHEW SHOULD IN NO MANNER INTERFERE WITH THE REGULAR HOURS SHE HAD ESTABLISHED CONSEQUENTLY THE PARTY WERE ALREADY SEATED WHEN THE CAPTAIN MADE HIS APPEARANCE
200-126784-0007 THOUGH THE UNTASTED COFFEE SUFFICIENTLY PROVED THAT BY NONE OF HIS RELATIVES WAS HIS ABSENCE DISREGARDED I THINK I DID MUCH BETTER HE CRIED TAKING A CHAIR BETWEEN HIS SISTERS AND RECEIVING THEIR OFFERED SALUTES
200-126784-0008 TURNING TO HIS YOUNGER AND EVIDENTLY FAVORITE SISTER AND TAPPING HER CHEEK DID YOU SEE BANNERS IN THE CLOUDS AND MISTAKE MISS PEYTON'S AEOLIAN HARP FOR REBELLIOUS MUSIC NAY HENRY REJOINED THE MAID
200-126784-0009 LOOKING AT HIM AFFECTIONATELY MUCH AS I LOVE MY OWN COUNTRY THE APPROACH OF HER TROOPS JUST NOW WOULD GIVE ME GREAT PAIN THE BROTHER MADE NO REPLY BUT RETURNING THE FONDNESS EXPRESSED IN HER EYE BY A LOOK OF FRATERNAL TENDERNESS
200-126784-0010 HE GENTLY PRESSED HER HAND IN SILENCE WHEN CAESAR WHO HAD PARTICIPATED LARGELY IN THE ANXIETY OF THE FAMILY AND WHO HAD RISEN WITH THE DAWN AND KEPT A VIGILANT WATCH ON THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS AS HE STOOD GAZING FROM ONE OF THE WINDOWS
200-126784-0011 RUN MASSA HARRY RUN
200-126784-0012 RUN REPEATED THE BRITISH OFFICER GATHERING HIMSELF UP IN MILITARY PRIDE NO MISTER CAESAR RUNNING IS NOT MY TRADE WHILE SPEAKING HE WALKED DELIBERATELY TO THE WINDOW
200-126784-0013 WHERE THE FAMILY WERE ALREADY COLLECTED IN THE GREATEST CONSTERNATION
200-126784-0014 HIS HOUSE WAS SURROUNDED BY A DOZEN SENTINELS TWO OR THREE OF THE DRAGOONS NOW DISMOUNTED AND DISAPPEARED IN A FEW MINUTES HOWEVER THEY RETURNED TO THE YARD FOLLOWED BY KATY FROM WHOSE
200-126784-0015 VIOLENT GESTICULATIONS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT MATTERS OF NO TRIFLING CONCERN WERE ON THE CARPET A SHORT COMMUNICATION WITH THE LOQUACIOUS HOUSEKEEPER FOLLOWED THE ARRIVAL OF THE MAIN BODY OF THE TROOP AND THE ADVANCE PARTY REMOUNTING
200-126784-0016 BUT THEY WERE ALL HAUGHTILY REJECTED BY THE YOUNG MAN AS UNWORTHY OF HIS CHARACTER IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETREAT TO THE WOODS IN THE REAR OF THE COTTAGE FOR HE WOULD UNAVOIDABLY BE SEEN AND FOLLOWED BY A TROOP OF HORSE AS INEVITABLY TAKEN
200-126784-0017 AT LENGTH HIS SISTERS WITH TREMBLING HANDS REPLACED HIS ORIGINAL DISGUISE THE INSTRUMENTS OF WHICH HAD BEEN CAREFULLY KEPT AT HAND BY CAESAR IN EXPECTATION OF SOME SUDDEN EMERGENCY
200-126784-0018 THIS ARRANGEMENT WAS HASTILY AND IMPERFECTLY COMPLETED AS THE DRAGOONS ENTERED THE LAWN AND ORCHARD OF THE LOCUSTS RIDING WITH THE RAPIDITY OF THE WIND AND IN THEIR TURN THE WHARTONS WERE SURROUNDED
200-126784-0019 NOTHING REMAINED NOW BUT TO MEET THE IMPENDING EXAMINATION WITH AS MUCH INDIFFERENCE AS THE FAMILY COULD ASSUME THE LEADER OF THE HORSE DISMOUNTED AND FOLLOWED BY A COUPLE OF HIS MEN HE APPROACHED THE OUTER DOOR OF THE BUILDING
200-126784-0020 WHICH WAS SLOWLY AND RELUCTANTLY OPENED FOR HIS ADMISSION BY CAESAR THE HEAVY TREAD OF THE TROOPER AS HE FOLLOWED THE BLACK TO THE DOOR OF THE PARLOR RANG IN THE EARS OF THE FEMALES AS IT APPROACHED NEARER AND NEARER
200-126784-0021 AND DROVE THE BLOOD FROM THEIR FACES TO THEIR HEARTS WITH A CHILL THAT NEARLY ANNIHILATED FEELING A MAN WHOSE COLOSSAL STATURE MANIFESTED THE POSSESSION OF VAST STRENGTH ENTERED THE ROOM AND REMOVING HIS CAP
200-126784-0022 HIS APPEARANCE DID NOT INDICATE AS BELONGING TO HIS NATURE HIS DARK HAIR HUNG AROUND HIS BROW IN PROFUSION THOUGH STAINED WITH POWDER WHICH WAS WORN AT THAT DAY AND HIS FACE WAS NEARLY HID IN THE WHISKERS BY WHICH IT WAS DISFIGURED
200-126784-0023 STILL THE EXPRESSION OF HIS EYE THOUGH PIERCING WAS NOT BAD AND HIS VOICE THOUGH DEEP AND POWERFUL WAS FAR FROM UNPLEASANT FRANCES VENTURED TO THROW A TIMID GLANCE AT HIS FIGURE AS HE ENTERED
200-126784-0024 AND SAW AT ONCE THE MAN FROM WHOSE SCRUTINY HARVEY BIRCH HAD WARNED THEM THERE WAS SO MUCH TO BE APPREHENDED YOU HAVE NO CAUSE FOR ALARM LADIES SAID THE OFFICER PAUSING A MOMENT AND CONTEMPLATING THE PALE FACES AROUND HIM
200-126784-0025 MY BUSINESS WILL BE CONFINED TO A FEW QUESTIONS WHICH IF FREELY ANSWERED WILL INSTANTLY REMOVE US FROM YOUR DWELLING AND WHAT MAY THEY BE SIR STAMMERED MISTER WHARTON
200-126784-0026 RISING FROM HIS CHAIR AND WAITING ANXIOUSLY FOR THE REPLY HAS THERE BEEN A STRANGE GENTLEMAN STAYING WITH YOU DURING THE STORM CONTINUED THE DRAGOON SPEAKING WITH INTEREST AND IN SOME DEGREE SHARING IN THE EVIDENT ANXIETY OF THE FATHER
200-126784-0027 AND HAS NOT YET DEPARTED THIS GENTLEMAN REPEATED THE OTHER TURNING TO CAPTAIN WHARTON AND CONTEMPLATING HIS FIGURE FOR A MOMENT
200-126784-0028 HE APPROACHED THE YOUTH WITH AN AIR OF COMIC GRAVITY AND WITH A LOW BOW CONTINUED I AM SORRY FOR THE SEVERE COLD YOU HAVE IN YOUR HEAD SIR I EXCLAIMED THE CAPTAIN IN SURPRISE
200-126784-0029 I HAVE NO COLD IN MY HEAD I FANCIED IT THEN FROM SEEING YOU HAD COVERED SUCH HANDSOME BLACK LOCKS WITH THAT UGLY OLD WIG IT WAS MY MISTAKE YOU WILL PLEASE TO PARDON IT
200-126784-0030 MISTER WHARTON GROANED ALOUD BUT THE LADIES IGNORANT OF THE EXTENT OF THEIR VISITOR'S KNOWLEDGE REMAINED IN TREMBLING YET RIGID SILENCE THE CAPTAIN HIMSELF MOVED HIS HAND INVOLUNTARILY TO HIS HEAD
200-126784-0031 AND DISCOVERED THAT THE TREPIDATION OF HIS SISTERS HAD LEFT SOME OF HIS NATURAL HAIR EXPOSED THE DRAGOON WATCHED THE MOVEMENT WITH A CONTINUED SMILE WHEN SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF TURNING TO THE FATHER HE PROCEEDED
200-126784-0032 MISTER HARPER ECHOED THE OTHER FEELING A LOAD REMOVED FROM HIS HEART YES I HAD FORGOTTEN BUT HE IS GONE AND IF THERE BE ANYTHING WRONG IN HIS CHARACTER WE ARE IN ENTIRE IGNORANCE OF IT
200-126784-0033 TO ME HE WAS A TOTAL STRANGER YOU HAVE BUT LITTLE TO APPREHEND FROM HIS CHARACTER ANSWERED THE DRAGOON DRYLY BUT HE IS GONE HOW WHEN AND WHITHER
200-126784-0034 HIS COUNTENANCE GRADUALLY LIGHTING INTO A SMILE OF PLEASURE
200-126784-0035 HE TURNED ON HIS HEEL AND LEFT THE APARTMENT THE WHARTONS JUDGING FROM HIS MANNER THOUGHT HE WAS ABOUT TO PROCEED IN QUEST OF THE OBJECT OF HIS INQUIRIES THEY OBSERVED THE DRAGOON ON
200-126784-0036 GAINING THE LAWN IN EARNEST AND APPARENTLY PLEASED CONVERSATION WITH HIS TWO SUBALTERNS IN A FEW MOMENTS ORDERS WERE GIVEN TO SOME OF THE TROOPS AND HORSEMEN LEFT THE VALLEY AT FULL SPEED BY ITS VARIOUS ROADS
200-126784-0037 THE SUSPENSE OF THE PARTY WITHIN WHO WERE ALL HIGHLY INTERESTED WITNESSES OF THIS SCENE
2002-139469-0000 SOME DISORDER HAD SURELY CREPT INTO THE COURSE OF THE ELEMENTS DESTROYING THEIR BENIGNANT INFLUENCE THE WIND PRINCE OF AIR RAGED THROUGH HIS KINGDOM LASHING THE SEA INTO FURY
2002-139469-0001 AND SUBDUING THE REBEL EARTH INTO SOME SORT OF OBEDIENCE THE GOD SENDS DOWN HIS ANGRY PLAGUES FROM HIGH FAMINE AND PESTILENCE IN HEAPS THEY DIE AGAIN IN VENGEANCE OF HIS WRATH HE FALLS
2002-139469-0002 ON THEIR GREAT HOSTS AND BREAKS THEIR TOTTERING WALLS ARRESTS THEIR NAVIES ON THE OCEAN'S PLAIN AND WHELMS THEIR STRENGTH WITH MOUNTAINS OF THE MAIN
2002-139469-0003 THEIR DEADLY POWER SHOOK THE FLOURISHING COUNTRIES OF THE SOUTH AND DURING WINTER EVEN WE IN OUR NORTHERN RETREAT BEGAN TO QUAKE UNDER THEIR ILL EFFECTS
2002-139469-0004 THAT FABLE IS UNJUST WHICH GIVES THE SUPERIORITY TO THE SUN OVER THE WIND WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE LIGHTSOME EARTH THE BALMY ATMOSPHERE AND BASKING NATURE BECOME DARK COLD
2002-139469-0005 AND UNGENIAL WHEN THE SLEEPING WIND HAS AWOKE IN THE EAST OR WHEN THE DUN CLOUDS THICKLY VEIL THE SKY
2002-139469-0006 UNTIL THE DANK EARTH REFUSING TO IMBIBE THE SUPERABUNDANT MOISTURE IT LIES IN POOLS ON THE SURFACE WHEN THE TORCH OF DAY SEEMS LIKE A METEOR TO BE QUENCHED
2002-139469-0007 WHO HAS NOT SEEN THE CLOUD STIRRING NORTH ARISE THE STREAKED BLUE APPEAR AND SOON AN OPENING MADE IN THE VAPOURS IN THE EYE OF THE WIND THROUGH WHICH THE BRIGHT AZURE SHINES
2002-139469-0008 THE CLOUDS BECOME THIN AN ARCH IS FORMED FOR EVER RISING UPWARDS TILL THE UNIVERSAL COPE BEING UNVEILED THE SUN POURS FORTH ITS RAYS RE ANIMATED AND FED BY THE BREEZE
2002-139469-0009 THEN MIGHTY ART THOU O WIND TO BE THRONED ABOVE ALL
2002-139469-0010 WHETHER THOU COMEST DESTROYING FROM THE EAST OR PREGNANT WITH ELEMENTARY LIFE FROM THE WEST THEE THE CLOUDS OBEY THE SUN IS SUBSERVIENT TO THEE THE SHORELESS
2002-139469-0011 OCEAN IS THY SLAVE THOU SWEEPEST OVER THE EARTH AND OAKS THE GROWTH OF CENTURIES SUBMIT TO THY VIEWLESS AXE THE SNOW DRIFT IS SCATTERED ON THE PINNACLES OF THE ALPS
2002-139469-0012 THE AVALANCHE THUNDERS DOWN THEIR VALLIES THOU HOLDEST THE KEYS OF THE FROST AND CANST FIRST CHAIN AND THEN SET FREE THE STREAMS UNDER THY GENTLE GOVERNANCE THE BUDS AND LEAVES ARE BORN
2002-139469-0013 THEY FLOURISH NURSED BY THEE WHY DOST THOU HOWL THUS O WIND BY DAY AND BY NIGHT FOR FOUR LONG MONTHS THY ROARINGS HAVE NOT CEASED THE SHORES OF THE SEA ARE STREWN WITH WRECKS
2002-139469-0014 THE EARTH HAS SHED HER BEAUTY IN OBEDIENCE TO THY COMMAND THE FRAIL BALLOON DARES NO LONGER SAIL ON THE AGITATED AIR THY MINISTERS THE CLOUDS DELUGE THE LAND WITH RAIN
2002-139469-0015 RIVERS FORSAKE THEIR BANKS THE WILD TORRENT TEARS UP THE MOUNTAIN PATH PLAIN AND WOOD AND VERDANT DELL ARE DESPOILED OF THEIR LOVELINESS
2002-139469-0016 OUR VERY CITIES ARE WASTED BY THEE ALAS WHAT WILL BECOME OF US IT SEEMS AS IF THE GIANT WAVES OF OCEAN AND VAST ARMS OF THE SEA WERE ABOUT TO WRENCH THE DEEP ROOTED ISLAND FROM ITS CENTRE AND CAST IT
2002-139469-0017 A RUIN AND A WRECK UPON THE FIELDS OF THE ATLANTIC WHAT ARE WE THE INHABITANTS OF THIS GLOBE LEAST AMONG THE MANY THAT PEOPLE INFINITE SPACE OUR MINDS EMBRACE INFINITY
2002-139469-0018 OF OUR BEING IS SUBJECT TO MEREST ACCIDENT DAY BY DAY WE ARE FORCED TO BELIEVE THIS HE WHOM A SCRATCH HAS DISORGANIZED HE WHO DISAPPEARS FROM APPARENT LIFE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HOSTILE AGENCY AT WORK AROUND US
2002-139469-0019 HAD THE SAME POWERS AS I I
2002-139469-0020 IN THE FACE OF ALL THIS WE CALL OURSELVES LORDS OF THE CREATION WIELDERS OF THE ELEMENTS MASTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH AND WE ALLEGE IN EXCUSE OF THIS ARROGANCE THAT THOUGH THE INDIVIDUAL IS DESTROYED
2002-139469-0021 MAN CONTINUES FOR EVER THUS LOSING OUR IDENTITY THAT OF WHICH WE ARE CHIEFLY CONSCIOUS WE GLORY IN THE CONTINUITY OF OUR SPECIES AND LEARN TO REGARD DEATH WITHOUT TERROR
2002-139469-0022 BUT WHEN ANY WHOLE NATION BECOMES THE VICTIM OF THE DESTRUCTIVE POWERS OF EXTERIOR AGENTS THEN INDEED MAN SHRINKS INTO INSIGNIFICANCE HE FEELS HIS TENURE OF LIFE INSECURE
2002-139469-0023 HIS INHERITANCE ON EARTH CUT OFF I REMEMBER AFTER HAVING WITNESSED THE DESTRUCTIVE EFFECTS OF A FIRE I COULD NOT EVEN BEHOLD A SMALL ONE IN A STOVE WITHOUT A SENSATION OF FEAR
2002-139469-0024 THE MOUNTING FLAMES HAD CURLED ROUND THE BUILDING AS IT FELL AND WAS DESTROYED THEY INSINUATED THEMSELVES INTO THE SUBSTANCES ABOUT THEM
2002-139469-0025 AND THE IMPEDIMENTS TO THEIR PROGRESS YIELDED AT THEIR TOUCH COULD WE TAKE INTEGRAL PARTS OF THIS POWER AND NOT BE SUBJECT TO ITS OPERATION COULD WE DOMESTICATE A CUB OF THIS WILD BEAST
2002-139469-0026 AND NOT FEAR ITS GROWTH AND MATURITY THUS WE BEGAN TO FEEL WITH REGARD TO MANY VISAGED DEATH LET LOOSE ON THE CHOSEN DISTRICTS OF OUR FAIR HABITATION
2002-139469-0027 AND ABOVE ALL WITH REGARD TO THE PLAGUE WE FEARED THE COMING SUMMER NATIONS BORDERING ON THE ALREADY INFECTED COUNTRIES BEGAN TO ENTER UPON SERIOUS PLANS FOR THE BETTER KEEPING OUT OF THE ENEMY
2002-139469-0028 WE A COMMERCIAL PEOPLE WERE OBLIGED TO BRING SUCH SCHEMES UNDER CONSIDERATION AND THE QUESTION OF CONTAGION BECAME MATTER OF EARNEST DISQUISITION
2002-139469-0029 THAT THE PLAGUE WAS NOT WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED CONTAGIOUS LIKE THE SCARLET FEVER OR EXTINCT SMALL POX WAS PROVED IT WAS CALLED AN EPIDEMIC BUT THE GRAND QUESTION
2002-139469-0030 WAS STILL UNSETTLED OF HOW THIS EPIDEMIC WAS GENERATED AND INCREASED IF INFECTION DEPENDED UPON THE AIR THE AIR WAS SUBJECT TO INFECTION
2002-139469-0031 HAS BEEN BROUGHT BY SHIPS TO ONE SEA PORT TOWN YET THE VERY PEOPLE WHO BROUGHT IT THERE WERE INCAPABLE OF COMMUNICATING IT IN A TOWN MORE FORTUNATELY SITUATED BUT HOW ARE WE TO JUDGE OF AIRS
2002-139469-0032 AND PRONOUNCE IN SUCH A CITY PLAGUE WILL DIE UNPRODUCTIVE IN SUCH ANOTHER NATURE HAS PROVIDED FOR IT A PLENTIFUL HARVEST
2002-139469-0033 IN THE SAME WAY INDIVIDUALS MAY ESCAPE NINETY NINE TIMES AND RECEIVE THE DEATH BLOW AT THE HUNDREDTH BECAUSE BODIES ARE SOMETIMES
2002-139469-0034 THESE REFLECTIONS MADE OUR LEGISLATORS PAUSE BEFORE THEY COULD DECIDE ON THE LAWS TO BE PUT IN FORCE THE EVIL WAS SO WIDE SPREADING SO VIOLENT AND IMMEDICABLE THAT NO CARE NO PREVENTION COULD BE JUDGED SUPERFLUOUS
2002-139469-0035 WHICH EVEN ADDED A CHANCE TO OUR ESCAPE THESE WERE QUESTIONS OF PRUDENCE THERE WAS NO IMMEDIATE NECESSITY FOR AN EARNEST CAUTION ENGLAND WAS STILL SECURE FRANCE
2002-139469-0036 GERMANY ITALY AND SPAIN WERE INTERPOSED WALLS YET WITHOUT A BREACH BETWEEN US AND THE PLAGUE OUR VESSELS TRULY WERE THE SPORT OF WINDS AND WAVES EVEN AS GULLIVER
2002-139469-0037 BROBDIGNAGIANS BUT WE ON OUR STABLE ABODE COULD NOT BE HURT IN LIFE OR LIMB BY THESE ERUPTIONS OF NATURE WE COULD NOT FEAR WE DID NOT YET A FEELING OF AWE
2002-139469-0038 A BREATHLESS SENTIMENT OF WONDER A PAINFUL SENSE
2002-139469-0039 DEGRADATION OF HUMANITY WAS INTRODUCED INTO EVERY HEART NATURE OUR MOTHER AND OUR FRIEND HAD TURNED ON US A BROW OF MENACE SHE SHEWED US PLAINLY THAT THOUGH SHE PERMITTED US TO ASSIGN HER LAWS AND SUBDUE HER APPARENT POWERS
2002-139469-0040 WE MUST QUAKE SHE COULD TAKE OUR GLOBE
2002-139469-0041 AND ALL THAT MAN'S MIND COULD INVENT OR HIS FORCE ACHIEVE SHE COULD TAKE THE BALL IN HER HAND AND CAST IT INTO SPACE WHERE LIFE WOULD BE DRUNK UP AND MAN AND ALL HIS EFFORTS FOR EVER ANNIHILATED
2002-139469-0042 THESE SPECULATIONS WERE RIFE AMONG US YET NOT THE LESS WE PROCEEDED IN OUR DAILY OCCUPATIONS AND OUR PLANS WHOSE ACCOMPLISHMENT DEMANDED THE LAPSE OF MANY YEARS NO VOICE WAS HEARD TELLING US TO HOLD
2002-139469-0043 WHEN FOREIGN DISTRESSES CAME TO BE FELT BY US THROUGH THE CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WE SET OURSELVES TO APPLY REMEDIES SUBSCRIPTIONS WERE MADE FOR THE EMIGRANTS AND MERCHANTS BANKRUPT BY THE FAILURE OF TRADE
2002-139469-0044 THE ENGLISH SPIRIT AWOKE TO ITS FULL ACTIVITY AND AS IT HAD EVER DONE SET ITSELF TO RESIST THE EVIL AND TO STAND IN THE BREACH WHICH DISEASED NATURE HAD SUFFERED CHAOS AND DEATH TO MAKE
2002-139469-0045 IN THE BOUNDS AND BANKS WHICH HAD HITHERTO KEPT THEM OUT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF SUMMER WE BEGAN TO FEEL THAT THE MISCHIEF WHICH HAD TAKEN PLACE IN DISTANT COUNTRIES WAS GREATER THAN WE HAD AT FIRST SUSPECTED
2002-139469-0046 QUITO WAS DESTROYED BY AN EARTHQUAKE MEXICO LAID WASTE BY THE UNITED EFFECTS OF STORM PESTILENCE AND FAMINE CROWDS OF EMIGRANTS INUNDATED THE WEST OF EUROPE
2002-139469-0047 AND OUR ISLAND HAD BECOME THE REFUGE OF THOUSANDS IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0048 HE HAD SOUGHT THIS OFFICE WITH EAGERNESS UNDER THE IDEA OF TURNING HIS WHOLE FORCES TO THE SUPPRESSION OF THE PRIVILEGED ORDERS OF OUR COMMUNITY
2002-139469-0049 AT LENGTH FORBADE A RECOURSE TO THE USUAL MODES OF RELIEF TRADE WAS STOPPED BY THE FAILURE OF THE INTERCHANGE OF CARGOES USUAL BETWEEN US AND AMERICA INDIA EGYPT AND GREECE
2002-139469-0050 IN VAIN OUR PROTECTOR AND HIS PARTIZANS SOUGHT TO CONCEAL THIS TRUTH IN VAIN DAY AFTER DAY HE APPOINTED A PERIOD FOR THE DISCUSSION OF THE NEW LAWS CONCERNING HEREDITARY RANK AND PRIVILEGE
2002-139469-0051 IN VAIN HE ENDEAVOURED TO REPRESENT THE EVIL AS PARTIAL AND TEMPORARY THESE DISASTERS CAME HOME TO SO MANY BOSOMS AND THROUGH THE VARIOUS CHANNELS OF COMMERCE WERE CARRIED SO
2002-139469-0052 ENTIRELY INTO EVERY CLASS AND DIVISION OF THE COMMUNITY THAT OF NECESSITY THEY BECAME THE FIRST QUESTION IN THE STATE THE CHIEF SUBJECTS TO WHICH WE MUST TURN OUR ATTENTION
2002-139469-0053 CAN IT BE TRUE EACH ASKED THE OTHER WITH WONDER AND DISMAY THAT WHOLE COUNTRIES ARE LAID WASTE WHOLE NATIONS ANNIHILATED BY THESE DISORDERS IN NATURE THE VAST CITIES OF AMERICA THE FERTILE PLAINS OF
2002-139469-0054 HINDOSTAN THE CROWDED ABODES OF THE CHINESE ARE MENACED WITH UTTER RUIN WHERE LATE THE BUSY MULTITUDES ASSEMBLED FOR PLEASURE OR PROFIT
2002-139469-0055 NOW ONLY THE SOUND OF WAILING AND MISERY IS HEARD THE AIR IS EMPOISONED AND EACH HUMAN BEING INHALES DEATH EVEN WHILE IN YOUTH AND HEALTH THEIR HOPES ARE IN THE FLOWER
2002-139469-0056 WE CALLED TO MIND THE PLAGUE OF THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT WHEN IT WAS CALCULATED THAT A THIRD OF MANKIND HAD BEEN DESTROYED AS YET WESTERN EUROPE WAS UNINFECTED WOULD IT ALWAYS BE SO
2002-139469-0057 O YES IT WOULD COUNTRYMEN FEAR NOT IN THE STILL UNCULTIVATED WILDS OF AMERICA WHAT WONDER THAT AMONG ITS OTHER GIANT DESTROYERS PLAGUE SHOULD BE NUMBERED
2002-139469-0058 IT WOULD EXPIRE IN THESE CLIMES IT DRINKS THE DARK BLOOD OF THE INHABITANT OF THE SOUTH BUT IT NEVER FEASTS ON THE PALE FACED CELT IF
2002-139469-0059 PERCHANCE SOME STRICKEN ASIATIC
2002-139469-0060 PLAGUE DIES WITH HIM UNCOMMUNICATED AND INNOXIOUS LET US WEEP FOR OUR BRETHREN THOUGH WE CAN NEVER EXPERIENCE THEIR REVERSE
2002-139469-0061 LET US LAMENT OVER AND ASSIST THE CHILDREN OF THE GARDEN OF THE EARTH LATE WE ENVIED THEIR ABODES THEIR SPICY GROVES FERTILE PLAINS AND ABUNDANT LOVELINESS BUT IN THIS MORTAL LIFE EXTREMES ARE ALWAYS MATCHED
2002-139469-0062 THE THORN GROWS WITH THE ROSE THE POISON TREE AND THE CINNAMON MINGLE THEIR BOUGHS
2002-139469-0063 MARBLE HALLS AND INFINITE WEALTH IS NOW A TOMB THE TENT OF THE ARAB IS FALLEN IN THE SANDS AND HIS HORSE SPURNS THE GROUND UNBRIDLED AND UNSADDLED THE VOICE OF LAMENTATION FILLS THE VALLEY OF CASHMERE
2002-139469-0064 ITS DELLS AND WOODS ITS COOL FOUNTAINS AND GARDENS OF ROSES ARE POLLUTED BY THE DEAD IN CIRCASSIA AND GEORGIA THE SPIRIT OF BEAUTY WEEPS OVER THE RUIN OF ITS FAVOURITE TEMPLE THE FORM OF WOMAN
2002-139469-0065 OUR OWN DISTRESSES THOUGH THEY WERE OCCASIONED BY THE FICTITIOUS RECIPROCITY OF COMMERCE ENCREASED IN DUE PROPORTION BANKERS MERCHANTS AND MANUFACTURERS
2002-139469-0066 WHOSE TRADE DEPENDED ON EXPORTS AND INTERCHANGE OF WEALTH BECAME BANKRUPT SUCH THINGS WHEN THEY HAPPEN SINGLY AFFECT ONLY THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES BUT THE PROSPERITY OF THE NATION WAS NOW SHAKEN BY FREQUENT AND EXTENSIVE LOSSES
2002-139469-0067 FAMILIES BRED IN OPULENCE AND LUXURY WERE REDUCED TO BEGGARY THE VERY STATE OF PEACE IN WHICH WE GLORIED WAS INJURIOUS THERE WERE NO MEANS OF EMPLOYING THE IDLE
2002-139469-0068 EVEN THE SOURCE OF COLONIES WAS DRIED UP FOR IN NEW HOLLAND
2002-139469-0069 AND THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PLAGUE RAGED
2002-139469-0070 AND BRING BACK THE EARTH TO ITS ACCUSTOMED HEALTH
2002-139469-0071 AT THE MULTITUDE OF EVILS THAT GATHERED ROUND US MUST HE TAX THE LANDED INTEREST TO ASSIST OUR COMMERCIAL POPULATION TO DO THIS HE MUST GAIN THE FAVOUR OF THE CHIEF LAND HOLDERS THE NOBILITY OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0072 AND THESE WERE HIS VOWED ENEMIES HE MUST CONCILIATE THEM BY ABANDONING HIS FAVOURITE SCHEME OF EQUALIZATION HE MUST CONFIRM THEM
2002-139469-0073 HE MUST SELL HIS CHERISHED PLANS FOR THE PERMANENT GOOD OF HIS COUNTRY FOR TEMPORARY RELIEF HE MUST AIM NO MORE AT THE DEAR OBJECT OF HIS AMBITION
2002-139469-0074 THROWING HIS ARMS ASIDE HE MUST FOR PRESENT ENDS GIVE UP THE ULTIMATE OBJECT OF HIS ENDEAVOURS HE CAME TO WINDSOR TO CONSULT WITH US EVERY DAY ADDED TO HIS DIFFICULTIES
2002-139469-0075 THE ARRIVAL OF FRESH VESSELS WITH EMIGRANTS THE TOTAL CESSATION OF COMMERCE THE STARVING MULTITUDE THAT THRONGED AROUND THE PALACE OF THE PROTECTORATE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES NOT TO BE TAMPERED WITH
2002-139469-0076 THE BLOW WAS STRUCK THE ARISTOCRACY OBTAINED ALL THEY WISHED AND THEY SUBSCRIBED TO A TWELVEMONTHS BILL WHICH LEVIED TWENTY PER CENT ON ALL THE RENT ROLLS OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0077 CALM WAS NOW RESTORED TO THE METROPOLIS AND TO THE POPULOUS CITIES BEFORE DRIVEN TO DESPERATION AND WE RETURNED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF DISTANT CALAMITIES WONDERING IF THE FUTURE WOULD BRING ANY ALLEVIATION
2002-139469-0078 TO THEIR EXCESS IT WAS AUGUST SO THERE COULD BE SMALL HOPE OF RELIEF DURING THE HEATS ON THE CONTRARY
2002-139469-0079 WHILE STARVATION DID ITS ACCUSTOMED WORK THOUSANDS DIED UNLAMENTED FOR BESIDE THE YET WARM CORPSE THE MOURNER WAS STRETCHED MADE MUTE BY DEATH
2002-139469-0080 ON THE EIGHTEENTH OF THIS MONTH NEWS ARRIVED IN LONDON THAT THE PLAGUE WAS IN FRANCE AND ITALY THESE TIDINGS WERE AT FIRST WHISPERED ABOUT TOWN BUT NO ONE DARED EXPRESS ALOUD THE SOUL QUAILING INTELLIGENCE
2002-139469-0081 WHEN ANY ONE MET A FRIEND IN THE STREET HE ONLY CRIED AS HE HURRIED ON YOU KNOW WHILE THE OTHER WITH AN EJACULATION OF FEAR AND HORROR WOULD ANSWER
2002-139469-0082 WHAT WILL BECOME OF US AT LENGTH IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE NEWSPAPERS THE PARAGRAPH WAS INSERTED IN AN OBSCURE PART WE REGRET TO STATE
2002-139469-0083 THAT THERE CAN BE NO LONGER A DOUBT OF THE PLAGUE HAVING BEEN INTRODUCED AT LEGHORN GENOA AND MARSEILLES NO WORD OF COMMENT FOLLOWED
2002-139469-0084 WE WERE AS A MAN WHO HEARS THAT HIS HOUSE IS BURNING AND YET HURRIES THROUGH THE STREETS BORNE ALONG BY A LURKING HOPE OF A MISTAKE
2002-139469-0085 AND SEES HIS SHELTERING ROOF ENVELOPED IN A FLAME BEFORE IT HAD BEEN A RUMOUR BUT NOW IN WORDS UNERASEABLE IN DEFINITE AND UNDENIABLE PRINT THE KNOWLEDGE WENT FORTH
2002-139469-0086 ITS OBSCURITY OF SITUATION RENDERED IT THE MORE CONSPICUOUS THE DIMINUTIVE LETTERS GREW GIGANTIC TO THE BEWILDERED EYE OF FEAR THEY SEEMED GRAVEN
2002-139469-0087 WITH A PEN OF IRON IMPRESSED BY FIRE WOVEN IN THE CLOUDS STAMPED ON THE VERY FRONT OF THE UNIVERSE THE ENGLISH
2002-139469-0088 WHETHER TRAVELLERS OR RESIDENTS CAME POURING IN ONE GREAT REVULSIVE STREAM BACK ON THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WITH THEM CROWDS OF ITALIANS AND SPANIARDS
2002-139469-0089 OUR LITTLE ISLAND WAS FILLED EVEN TO BURSTING AT FIRST AN UNUSUAL QUANTITY OF SPECIE MADE ITS APPEARANCE WITH THE EMIGRANTS BUT THESE PEOPLE HAD NO MEANS OF RECEIVING BACK INTO THEIR HANDS WHAT THEY SPENT AMONG US
2002-139469-0090 RENTS WERE UNPAID AND THEIR REMITTANCES FAILED THEM IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE THESE CROWDS OF WRETCHED PERISHING CREATURES LATE NURSLINGS OF LUXURY
2002-139469-0091 AND NOT STRETCH OUT A HAND TO SAVE THEM AS AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY THE ENGLISH UNLOCKED THEIR HOSPITABLE STORE FOR THE RELIEF OF THOSE DRIVEN FROM THEIR HOMES BY POLITICAL REVOLUTION
2002-139469-0092 SO NOW THEY WERE NOT BACKWARD IN AFFORDING AID TO THE VICTIMS OF A MORE WIDE SPREADING CALAMITY WE HAD MANY FOREIGN FRIENDS WHOM WE EAGERLY SOUGHT OUT AND RELIEVED FROM DREADFUL PENURY
2002-139469-0093 OUR CASTLE BECAME AN ASYLUM FOR THE UNHAPPY A LITTLE POPULATION OCCUPIED ITS HALLS THE REVENUE OF ITS POSSESSOR WHICH HAD ALWAYS FOUND A MODE OF EXPENDITURE CONGENIAL TO HIS GENEROUS NATURE
2002-139469-0094 WAS NOW ATTENDED TO MORE PARSIMONIOUSLY THAT IT MIGHT EMBRACE A WIDER PORTION OF UTILITY IT WAS NOT HOWEVER MONEY EXCEPT PARTIALLY BUT THE NECESSARIES OF LIFE
2002-139469-0095 THAT BECAME SCARCE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO FIND AN IMMEDIATE REMEDY THE USUAL ONE OF IMPORTS WAS ENTIRELY CUT OFF IN THIS EMERGENCY TO FEED THE VERY PEOPLE TO WHOM WE HAD GIVEN REFUGE WE WERE OBLIGED TO YIELD TO THE PLOUGH
2002-139469-0096 OUR PLEASURE GROUNDS AND PARKS LIVE STOCK DIMINISHED SENSIBLY IN THE COUNTRY FROM THE EFFECTS OF THE GREAT DEMAND IN THE MARKET EVEN THE POOR DEER OUR ANTLERED PROTEGES
2002-139469-0097 WERE OBLIGED TO FALL FOR THE SAKE OF WORTHIER PENSIONERS THE LABOUR NECESSARY TO BRING THE LANDS TO THIS SORT OF CULTURE EMPLOYED AND FED THE OFFCASTS OF THE DIMINISHED MANUFACTORIES
2002-139469-0098 ADRIAN DID NOT REST ONLY WITH THE EXERTIONS HE COULD MAKE WITH REGARD TO HIS OWN POSSESSIONS HE ADDRESSED HIMSELF TO THE WEALTHY OF THE LAND HE MADE PROPOSALS IN PARLIAMENT LITTLE ADAPTED TO PLEASE THE RICH
2002-139469-0099 EARNEST PLEADINGS AND BENEVOLENT ELOQUENCE WERE IRRESISTIBLE TO GIVE UP THEIR PLEASURE GROUNDS TO THE AGRICULTURIST TO DIMINISH SENSIBLY THE NUMBER OF HORSES KEPT FOR THE PURPOSES OF LUXURY THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0100 YET TO THE HONOUR OF THE ENGLISH BE IT RECORDED THAT ALTHOUGH NATURAL
2002-139469-0101 MADE THEM DELAY AWHILE YET WHEN THE MISERY OF THEIR FELLOW CREATURES BECAME GLARING AN ENTHUSIASTIC GENEROSITY INSPIRED THEIR DECREES
2002-139469-0102 THE MOST LUXURIOUS WERE OFTEN THE FIRST TO PART WITH THEIR INDULGENCIES AS IS COMMON IN COMMUNITIES A FASHION WAS SET THE HIGH BORN LADIES OF THE COUNTRY WOULD HAVE DEEMED THEMSELVES DISGRACED
2002-139469-0103 IF THEY HAD NOW ENJOYED WHAT THEY BEFORE CALLED A NECESSARY THE EASE OF A CARRIAGE CHAIRS AS IN OLDEN TIME AND INDIAN PALANQUINS WERE INTRODUCED FOR THE INFIRM
2002-139469-0104 BUT ELSE IT WAS NOTHING SINGULAR TO SEE FEMALES OF RANK GOING ON FOOT TO PLACES OF FASHIONABLE RESORT IT WAS MORE COMMON FOR ALL WHO POSSESSED LANDED PROPERTY TO SECEDE TO THEIR ESTATES
2002-139469-0105 ATTENDED BY WHOLE TROOPS OF THE INDIGENT TO CUT DOWN THEIR WOODS TO ERECT TEMPORARY DWELLINGS AND TO PORTION OUT THEIR PARKS PARTERRES AND FLOWER GARDENS
2002-139469-0106 TO NECESSITOUS FAMILIES MANY OF THESE OF HIGH RANK IN THEIR OWN COUNTRIES NOW WITH HOE IN HAND TURNED UP THE SOIL IT WAS FOUND NECESSARY AT LAST
2002-139469-0107 TO CHECK THE SPIRIT OF SACRIFICE AND TO REMIND THOSE WHOSE GENEROSITY PROCEEDED TO LAVISH WASTE THAT UNTIL THE PRESENT STATE OF THINGS BECAME PERMANENT OF WHICH THERE WAS NO LIKELIHOOD
2002-139469-0108 SO FAR AS TO MAKE A REACTION DIFFICULT EXPERIENCE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A YEAR OR TWO PESTILENCE WOULD CEASE IT WERE WELL THAT IN THE MEAN TIME
2002-139469-0109 WE SHOULD NOT HAVE DESTROYED OUR FINE BREEDS OF HORSES OR HAVE UTTERLY CHANGED THE FACE OF THE ORNAMENTED PORTION OF THE COUNTRY
2002-139469-0110 THE INFECTION HAD NOW SPREAD IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCES OF FRANCE BUT THAT COUNTRY HAD SO MANY RESOURCES IN THE WAY OF AGRICULTURE
2002-139469-0111 AND ITS INCREASE THROUGH FOREIGN EMIGRATION WAS LESS FELT THAN WITH US THE PANIC STRUCK APPEARED OF MORE INJURY THAN DISEASE AND ITS NATURAL
2002-139469-0112 CONCOMITANTS WINTER WAS HAILED A GENERAL AND NEVER FAILING PHYSICIAN
2002-139469-0113 WERE WELCOMED WITH GRATITUDE THE EFFECTS OF PURIFYING COLD WERE IMMEDIATELY FELT AND THE LISTS OF MORTALITY ABROAD WERE
2002-139469-0114 MANY OF OUR VISITORS LEFT US THOSE WHOSE HOMES WERE FAR IN THE SOUTH FLED DELIGHTEDLY FROM OUR NORTHERN WINTER AND SOUGHT THEIR NATIVE LAND SECURE OF PLENTY EVEN AFTER THEIR FEARFUL
2002-139469-0115 VISITATION WE BREATHED AGAIN

2007-132570-0008 YES HE DID INDEED MA'AMSELLE NOTWITHSTANDING ALL I COULD SAY TO THE CONTRARY
2007-132570-0009 AND HE MISTOOK LUDOVICO'S HALL FOR OLD CARLO'S
2007-132570-0010 SO WE WERE ALL AS STILL AS NIGHT THAT HE MIGHT SUPPOSE THERE WAS NOBODY IN THE ROOM BUT THE SIGNOR WAS AS CUNNING AS THE BEST OF US AND KEPT CALLING OUT AT THE DOOR
2007-132570-0011 COME FORTH MY VALOROUS SIGNOR STEWARD JUST THEN OLD CARLO OPENED HIS DOOR AND HE CAME WITH A FLASK IN HIS HAND FOR AS SOON AS THE SIGNOR SAW HIM
2007-132570-0012 HE WAS AS TAME AS COULD BE AND FOLLOWED HIM AWAY AS NATURALLY AS A DOG DOES A BUTCHER WITH A PIECE OF MEAT IN HIS BASKET ALL THIS I SAW THROUGH THE KEY HOLE WELL ANNETTE SAID LUDOVICO JEERINGLY SHALL I LET YOU OUT NOW
2007-132570-0013 INTERRUPTED EMILY QUITE WEARIED BY THIS STORY DO YOU KNOW WHETHER THERE ARE ANY PRISONERS IN THE CASTLE AND WHETHER THEY ARE CONFINED AT THIS END OF THE EDIFICE
2007-132570-0014 BUT IT IS EXPECTED BACK TO NIGHT OR TO MORROW AND I SHALL KNOW THEN PERHAPS EMILY ENQUIRED IF SHE HAD EVER HEARD THE SERVANTS TALK OF PRISONERS AH MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE ARCHLY
2007-132570-0015 NOW I DARE SAY YOU ARE THINKING OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT AND THAT HE MAY HAVE COME AMONG THE ARMIES WHICH THEY SAY ARE COME FROM OUR COUNTRY TO FIGHT AGAINST THIS STATE AND THAT HE HAS MET WITH SOME OF OUR PEOPLE AND IS TAKEN CAPTIVE
2007-132570-0016 O LORD HOW GLAD I SHOULD BE IF IT WAS SO WOULD YOU INDEED BE GLAD SAID EMILY IN A TONE OF MOURNFUL REPROACH TO BE SURE I SHOULD
2007-132570-0017 MA'AM REPLIED ANNETTE AND WOULD NOT YOU BE GLAD TOO TO SEE SIGNOR VALANCOURT I DON'T KNOW ANY CHEVALIER I LIKE BETTER I HAVE A VERY GREAT REGARD FOR THE SIGNOR TRULY
2007-132570-0018 YOUR REGARD FOR HIM CANNOT BE DOUBTED SAID EMILY SINCE YOU WISH TO SEE HIM A PRISONER WHY NO MA'AMSELLE NOT A PRISONER EITHER BUT ONE MUST BE GLAD TO SEE HIM YOU KNOW AND IT WAS ONLY THE OTHER NIGHT I DREAMT
2007-132570-0019 AND THEN IT WAS GONE AND NOTHING TO BE SEEN BUT THE OLD CASTLE WALLS SO THEY HELPED ONE ANOTHER UP AGAIN AS FAST AS THEY COULD YOU WOULD NOT BELIEVE MA'AMSELLE THOUGH I SHEWED YOU THE VERY CANNON WHERE IT USED TO APPEAR
2007-132570-0020 AND ARE YOU INDEED SO SIMPLE ANNETTE SAID EMILY SMILING AT THIS CURIOUS EXAGGERATION OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SHE HAD WITNESSED AS TO CREDIT THESE STORIES CREDIT THEM MA'AMSELLE WHY
2007-132570-0021 ALL THE WORLD COULD NOT PERSUADE ME OUT OF THEM ROBERTO AND SEBASTIAN AND HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THEM WENT INTO FITS TO BE SURE THERE WAS NO OCCASION FOR THAT I SAID MYSELF THERE WAS NO NEED OF THAT
2007-132570-0022 FOR SAYS I WHEN THE ENEMY COMES WHAT A PRETTY FIGURE THEY WILL CUT IF THEY ARE TO FALL DOWN IN FITS ALL OF A ROW THE ENEMY WON'T BE SO CIVIL PERHAPS AS TO WALK OFF LIKE THE GHOST AND LEAVE THEM TO HELP ONE ANOTHER UP
2007-132570-0023 BUT WILL FALL TO CUTTING AND SLASHING TILL HE MAKES THEM ALL RISE UP DEAD MEN NO NO SAYS I THERE IS REASON IN ALL THINGS
2007-132570-0024 BEING BECAUSE IT IS NO BUSINESS OF MINE TO LOOK GRUFF AND FIGHT BATTLES EMILY ENDEAVOURED TO CORRECT THE SUPERSTITIOUS WEAKNESS OF ANNETTE THOUGH SHE COULD NOT ENTIRELY SUBDUE HER OWN TO WHICH THE LATTER ONLY REPLIED
2007-132570-0025 NAY MA'AMSELLE YOU WILL BELIEVE NOTHING YOU ARE ALMOST AS BAD AS THE SIGNOR HIMSELF WHO WAS IN A GREAT PASSION WHEN THEY TOLD OF WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND SWORE THAT THE FIRST MAN WHO REPEATED SUCH NONSENSE SHOULD BE THROWN INTO THE DUNGEON UNDER THE EAST TURRET THIS WAS A HARD
2007-132570-0026 BUT I DARE SAY HE HAD OTHER REASONS FOR CALLING IT SO THAN YOU HAVE MA'AM EMILY LOOKED DISPLEASED AND MADE NO REPLY AS SHE MUSED UPON THE RECOLLECTED APPEARANCE WHICH HAD LATELY SO MUCH ALARMED HER AND CONSIDERED THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE FIGURE HAVING STATIONED ITSELF
2007-132570-0027 OPPOSITE TO HER CASEMENT SHE WAS FOR A MOMENT INCLINED TO BELIEVE IT WAS VALANCOURT WHOM SHE HAD SEEN YET IF IT WAS HE WHY DID HE NOT SPEAK TO HER WHEN HE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF DOING SO AND IF HE WAS A PRISONER IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0028 AND HE COULD BE HERE IN NO OTHER CHARACTER HOW COULD HE OBTAIN THE MEANS OF WALKING ABROAD ON THE RAMPART
2007-132570-0029 WERE THE SAME OR IF THEY WERE WHETHER THIS WAS VALANCOURT SHE HOWEVER DESIRED THAT ANNETTE WOULD ENDEAVOUR TO LEARN WHETHER ANY PRISONERS WERE IN THE CASTLE AND ALSO THEIR NAMES O DEAR MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I FORGET TO TELL YOU WHAT YOU BADE ME ASK ABOUT
2007-132570-0030 THE LADIES AS THEY CALL THEMSELVES WHO ARE LATELY COME TO UDOLPHO WHY THAT SIGNORA LIVONA THAT THE SIGNOR BROUGHT TO SEE MY LATE LADY AT VENICE IS HIS MISTRESS NOW AND WAS LITTLE BETTER THEN I DARE SAY AND LUDOVICO SAYS
2007-132570-0031 BUT PRAY BE SECRET MA'AM THAT HIS EXCELLENZA INTRODUCED HER ONLY TO IMPOSE UPON THE WORLD THAT HAD BEGUN TO MAKE FREE WITH HER CHARACTER SO WHEN PEOPLE SAW MY LADY NOTICE HER THEY THOUGHT WHAT THEY HAD HEARD MUST BE SCANDAL
2007-132570-0032 BUT I THOUGHT THEY WERE DISMAL SOUNDS SO SOON AFTER MY POOR LADY'S DEATH TOO
2007-132570-0033 BUT SHE CANNOT HEAR THEM NOW POOR SOUL SAID I EMILY TURNED AWAY TO CONCEAL HER EMOTION AND THEN DESIRED ANNETTE TO GO AND MAKE ENQUIRY CONCERNING THE PRISONERS THAT MIGHT BE IN THE CASTLE
2007-132570-0034 BUT CONJURED HER TO DO IT WITH CAUTION AND ON NO ACCOUNT TO MENTION HER NAME OR THAT OF MONSIEUR VALANCOURT NOW I THINK OF IT MA'AMSELLE SAID ANNETTE I DO BELIEVE THERE ARE PRISONERS FOR I OVERHEARD ONE OF THE SIGNOR'S MEN YESTERDAY
2007-132570-0035 AND SAYING WHAT A FINE THING IT WAS FOR HIS EXCELLENZA TO CATCH UP MEN AND THEY WERE AS GOOD BOOTY AS ANY OTHER BECAUSE OF THE RANSOMS
2007-132570-0036 BECAUSE SAID HE WE DON'T GO SHARES THERE THIS INFORMATION HEIGHTENED EMILY'S IMPATIENCE TO KNOW MORE AND ANNETTE IMMEDIATELY DEPARTED ON HER ENQUIRY THE LATE RESOLUTION OF EMILY TO RESIGN HER ESTATES TO MONTONI NOW GAVE WAY TO NEW CONSIDERATIONS
2007-132570-0037 THE POSSIBILITY THAT VALANCOURT WAS NEAR HER REVIVED HER FORTITUDE AND SHE DETERMINED TO BRAVE THE THREATENED VENGEANCE AT LEAST TILL SHE COULD BE ASSURED WHETHER HE WAS REALLY IN THE CASTLE SHE WAS IN THIS TEMPER OF MIND WHEN SHE RECEIVED A MESSAGE FROM MONTONI REQUIRING HER ATTENDANCE IN THE CEDAR PARLOUR
2007-132570-0038 WHICH SHE OBEYED WITH TREMBLING AND ON HER WAY THITHER ENDEAVOURED TO ANIMATE HER FORTITUDE WITH THE IDEA OF VALANCOURT MONTONI WAS ALONE I SENT FOR YOU SAID HE TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY OF RETRACTING YOUR LATE MISTAKEN ASSERTIONS
2007-132570-0039 I WILL CONDESCEND TO ADVISE WHERE I MAY COMMAND
2007-132570-0040 IF I HAVE NO RIGHT IN THESE ESTATES SIR SAID EMILY OF WHAT SERVICE CAN IT BE TO YOU THAT I SHOULD SIGN ANY PAPERS CONCERNING THEM IF THE LANDS ARE YOURS BY LAW YOU CERTAINLY MAY POSSESS THEM WITHOUT MY INTERFERENCE OR MY CONSENT
2007-132570-0041 I WILL HAVE NO MORE ARGUMENT SAID MONTONI WITH A LOOK THAT MADE HER TREMBLE WHAT HAD I BUT TROUBLE TO EXPECT WHEN I CONDESCENDED TO REASON WITH A BABY BUT I WILL BE TRIFLED WITH NO LONGER
2007-132570-0042 LET THE RECOLLECTION OF YOUR AUNT'S SUFFERINGS IN CONSEQUENCE OF HER FOLLY AND OBSTINACY TEACH YOU A LESSON SIGN THE PAPERS EMILY'S RESOLUTION WAS FOR A MOMENT AWED SHE SHRUNK AT THE RECOLLECTIONS HE REVIVED
2007-132570-0043 AND FROM THE VENGEANCE HE THREATENED BUT THEN THE IMAGE OF VALANCOURT WHO SO LONG HAD LOVED HER AND WHO WAS NOW PERHAPS SO NEAR HER CAME TO HER HEART AND TOGETHER WITH THE STRONG FEELINGS OF INDIGNATION WITH WHICH SHE HAD ALWAYS
2007-132570-0044 FROM HER INFANCY REGARDED AN ACT OF INJUSTICE INSPIRED HER WITH A NOBLE THOUGH IMPRUDENT COURAGE SIGN THE PAPERS SAID MONTONI MORE IMPATIENTLY THAN BEFORE NEVER SIR
2007-132570-0045 REPLIED EMILY THAT REQUEST WOULD HAVE PROVED TO ME THE INJUSTICE OF YOUR CLAIM HAD I EVEN BEEN IGNORANT OF MY RIGHT MONTONI TURNED PALE WITH ANGER WHILE HIS QUIVERING LIP AND LURKING EYE MADE HER ALMOST REPENT THE BOLDNESS OF HER SPEECH
2007-132570-0046 THEN ALL MY VENGEANCE FALLS UPON YOU HE EXCLAIMED WITH AN HORRIBLE OATH AND THINK NOT IT SHALL BE DELAYED
2007-132570-0047 YOU HAVE DARED TO QUESTION MY RIGHT NOW DARE TO QUESTION MY POWER I HAVE A PUNISHMENT WHICH YOU THINK NOT OF IT IS TERRIBLE THIS NIGHT THIS VERY NIGHT' THIS
2007-132570-0048 NIGHT REPEATED ANOTHER VOICE MONTONI PAUSED AND TURNED HALF ROUND BUT SEEMING TO RECOLLECT HIMSELF HE PROCEEDED IN A LOWER TONE YOU HAVE LATELY SEEN ONE TERRIBLE EXAMPLE OF OBSTINACY AND FOLLY
2007-132570-0049 YET THIS IT APPEARS HAS NOT BEEN SUFFICIENT TO DETER YOU
2007-132570-0050 I COULD MAKE YOU TREMBLE AT THE BARE RECITAL HE WAS INTERRUPTED BY A GROAN WHICH SEEMED TO RISE FROM UNDERNEATH THE CHAMBER THEY WERE IN AND AS HE THREW A GLANCE ROUND IT IMPATIENCE AND RAGE FLASHED FROM HIS EYES
2007-132570-0051 YET SOMETHING LIKE A SHADE OF FEAR PASSED OVER HIS COUNTENANCE EMILY SAT DOWN IN A CHAIR NEAR THE DOOR FOR THE VARIOUS EMOTIONS SHE HAD SUFFERED NOW ALMOST OVERCAME HER BUT MONTONI PAUSED SCARCELY AN INSTANT AND COMMANDING HIS FEATURES
2007-132570-0052 RESUMED HIS DISCOURSE IN A LOWER YET STERNER VOICE I SAY I COULD GIVE YOU OTHER INSTANCES OF MY POWER AND OF MY CHARACTER WHICH IT SEEMS YOU DO NOT UNDERSTAND OR YOU WOULD NOT DEFY ME
2007-132570-0053 I COULD TELL YOU THAT WHEN ONCE MY RESOLUTION IS TAKEN BUT I AM TALKING TO A BABY LET ME HOWEVER REPEAT THAT TERRIBLE AS ARE THE EXAMPLES I COULD RECITE THE RECITAL COULD NOT NOW BENEFIT YOU
2007-132570-0054 FOR THOUGH YOUR REPENTANCE WOULD PUT AN IMMEDIATE END TO OPPOSITION IT WOULD NOT NOW APPEASE MY INDIGNATION I WILL HAVE VENGEANCE AS WELL AS JUSTICE ANOTHER GROAN FILLED THE PAUSE WHICH MONTONI MADE
2007-132570-0055 LEAVE THE ROOM INSTANTLY SAID HE SEEMING NOT TO NOTICE THIS STRANGE OCCURRENCE WITHOUT POWER TO IMPLORE HIS PITY SHE ROSE TO GO BUT FOUND THAT SHE COULD NOT SUPPORT HERSELF AWE AND TERROR OVERCAME HER AND SHE SUNK AGAIN INTO THE CHAIR
2007-132570-0056 QUIT MY PRESENCE CRIED MONTONI THIS AFFECTATION OF FEAR ILL BECOMES THE HEROINE WHO HAS JUST DARED TO BRAVE MY INDIGNATION DID YOU HEAR NOTHING SIGNOR SAID EMILY TREMBLING AND STILL UNABLE TO LEAVE THE ROOM
2007-132570-0057 I HEARD MY OWN VOICE REJOINED MONTONI STERNLY AND NOTHING ELSE
2007-132570-0058 OBEY MY ORDER REPEATED MONTONI AND FOR THESE FOOL'S TRICKS I WILL SOON DISCOVER BY WHOM THEY ARE PRACTISED EMILY AGAIN ROSE AND EXERTED HERSELF TO THE UTMOST TO LEAVE THE ROOM WHILE MONTONI FOLLOWED HER
2007-132570-0059 BUT INSTEAD OF CALLING ALOUD TO HIS SERVANTS TO SEARCH THE CHAMBER AS HE HAD FORMERLY DONE ON A SIMILAR OCCURRENCE PASSED TO THE RAMPARTS AS IN HER WAY TO THE CORRIDOR SHE RESTED FOR A MOMENT AT AN OPEN CASEMENT EMILY SAW A PARTY OF MONTONI'S TROOPS WINDING DOWN A DISTANT MOUNTAIN
2007-132570-0060 WHOM SHE NOTICED NO FURTHER THAN AS THEY BROUGHT TO HER MIND THE WRETCHED PRISONERS THEY WERE PERHAPS BRINGING TO THE CASTLE AT LENGTH HAVING REACHED HER APARTMENT SHE THREW HERSELF UPON THE COUCH OVERCOME WITH THE NEW HORRORS OF HER SITUATION
2007-149877-0000 ON THIS PARTICULAR EVENING HE DINED AT RECTOR'S A RESTAURANT OF SOME LOCAL FAME WHICH OCCUPIED A BASEMENT AT CLARK AND MONROE STREETS THEREAFTER HE VISITED THE RESORT OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S IN ADAMS STREET OPPOSITE THE IMPOSING FEDERAL BUILDING
2007-149877-0001 THERE HE LEANED OVER THE SPLENDID BAR AND SWALLOWED A GLASS OF PLAIN WHISKEY AND PURCHASED A COUPLE OF CIGARS ONE OF WHICH HE LIGHTED THIS TO HIM REPRESENTED IN PART HIGH LIFE A FAIR SAMPLE OF WHAT THE WHOLE MUST BE
2007-149877-0002 DROUET WAS NOT A DRINKER IN EXCESS HE WAS NOT A MONEYED MAN HE ONLY CRAVED THE BEST AS HIS MIND CONCEIVED IT AND SUCH DOINGS SEEMED TO HIM A PART OF THE BEST
2007-149877-0003 RECTOR'S WITH ITS POLISHED MARBLE WALLS AND FLOOR ITS PROFUSION OF LIGHTS ITS SHOW OF CHINA AND SILVERWARE AND ABOVE ALL ITS REPUTATION AS A RESORT FOR ACTORS AND PROFESSIONAL MEN SEEMED TO HIM THE PROPER PLACE FOR A SUCCESSFUL MAN TO GO
2007-149877-0004 HE LOVED FINE CLOTHES GOOD EATING AND PARTICULARLY THE COMPANY AND ACQUAINTANCESHIP OF SUCCESSFUL MEN WHEN DINING IT WAS A SOURCE OF KEEN SATISFACTION TO HIM TO KNOW THAT JOSEPH JEFFERSON WAS WONT TO COME TO THIS SAME PLACE
2007-149877-0005 OR THAT HENRY E DIXIE A WELL KNOWN PERFORMER OF THE DAY WAS THEN ONLY A FEW TABLES OFF AT RECTOR'S HE COULD ALWAYS OBTAIN THIS SATISFACTION FOR THERE ONE COULD ENCOUNTER POLITICIANS BROKERS ACTORS
2007-149877-0006 SOME RICH YOUNG ROUNDERS OF THE TOWN ALL EATING AND DRINKING AMID A BUZZ OF POPULAR COMMONPLACE CONVERSATION THAT'S SO AND SO OVER THERE WAS A COMMON REMARK OF THESE GENTLEMEN AMONG THEMSELVES
2007-149877-0007 PARTICULARLY AMONG THOSE WHO HAD NOT YET REACHED BUT HOPED TO DO SO THE DAZZLING HEIGHT WHICH MONEY TO DINE HERE LAVISHLY REPRESENTED YOU DON'T SAY SO WOULD BE THE REPLY WHY
2007-149877-0008 WHY HE'S MANAGER OF THE GRAND OPERA HOUSE WHEN THESE THINGS WOULD FALL UPON DROUET'S EARS HE WOULD STRAIGHTEN HIMSELF A LITTLE MORE STIFFLY AND EAT WITH SOLID COMFORT IF HE HAD ANY VANITY THIS AUGMENTED IT
2007-149877-0009 THE FLOORS WERE OF BRIGHTLY COLOURED TILES THE WALLS A COMPOSITION OF RICH DARK POLISHED WOOD WHICH REFLECTED THE LIGHT AND COLOURED STUCCO WORK WHICH GAVE THE PLACE A VERY SUMPTUOUS APPEARANCE
2007-149877-0010 THE LONG BAR WAS A BLAZE OF LIGHTS POLISHED WOOD WORK COLOURED AND CUT GLASSWARE AND MANY FANCY BOTTLES
2007-149877-0011 WITH RICH SCREENS FANCY WINES AND A LINE OF BAR GOODS UNSURPASSED IN THE COUNTRY AT RECTOR'S DROUET HAD MET MISTER G W HURSTWOOD MANAGER OF FITZGERALD AND MOY'S
2007-149877-0012 HE HAD BEEN POINTED OUT AS A VERY SUCCESSFUL AND WELL KNOWN MAN ABOUT TOWN HURSTWOOD LOOKED THE PART FOR BESIDES BEING SLIGHTLY UNDER FORTY HE HAD A GOOD STOUT CONSTITUTION AN ACTIVE MANNER AND A SOLID SUBSTANTIAL AIR
2007-149877-0013 WHICH WAS COMPOSED IN PART OF HIS FINE CLOTHES HIS CLEAN LINEN HIS JEWELS AND ABOVE ALL HIS OWN SENSE OF HIS IMPORTANCE DROUET IMMEDIATELY CONCEIVED A NOTION OF HIM AS BEING SOME ONE WORTH KNOWING
2007-149877-0014 AND WAS GLAD NOT ONLY TO MEET HIM BUT TO VISIT THE ADAMS STREET BAR THEREAFTER WHENEVER HE WANTED A DRINK OR A CIGAR HURSTWOOD WAS AN INTERESTING CHARACTER AFTER HIS KIND HE WAS SHREWD AND CLEVER IN MANY LITTLE THINGS
2007-149877-0015 AND CAPABLE OF CREATING A GOOD IMPRESSION HIS MANAGERIAL POSITION WAS FAIRLY IMPORTANT A KIND OF STEWARDSHIP WHICH WAS IMPOSING BUT LACKED FINANCIAL CONTROL HE HAD RISEN BY PERSEVERANCE AND INDUSTRY
2007-149877-0016 THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE AND FINANCIAL FUNCTIONS DEVOLVED UPON THE OWNERS
2007-149877-0017 AND UPON A CASHIER WHO LOOKED AFTER THE MONEY TAKEN IN FOR THE MOST PART HE LOUNGED ABOUT DRESSED IN EXCELLENT TAILORED SUITS OF IMPORTED GOODS A SOLITAIRE RING A FINE BLUE DIAMOND IN HIS TIE A STRIKING VEST OF SOME NEW PATTERN
2007-149877-0018 AND A WATCH CHAIN OF SOLID GOLD WHICH HELD A CHARM OF RICH DESIGN AND A WATCH OF THE LATEST MAKE AND ENGRAVING HE KNEW BY NAME AND COULD GREET PERSONALLY WITH A WELL OLD FELLOW
2007-149877-0019 HUNDREDS OF ACTORS MERCHANTS POLITICIANS AND THE GENERAL RUN OF SUCCESSFUL CHARACTERS ABOUT TOWN AND IT WAS PART OF HIS SUCCESS TO DO SO HE HAD A FINELY GRADUATED SCALE OF INFORMALITY AND FRIENDSHIP WHICH IMPROVED FROM THE HOW DO YOU DO
2007-149877-0020 WHO BY LONG FREQUENTING OF THE PLACE BECAME AWARE OF HIS POSITION TO THE WHY OLD MAN HOW ARE YOU WHICH HE ADDRESSED TO THOSE NOTED OR RICH INDIVIDUALS WHO KNEW HIM AND WERE INCLINED TO BE FRIENDLY THERE WAS A CLASS HOWEVER
2007-149877-0021 TOO RICH TOO FAMOUS OR TOO SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE COULD NOT ATTEMPT ANY FAMILIARITY OF ADDRESS AND WITH THESE HE WAS PROFESSIONALLY TACTFUL ASSUMING A GRAVE AND DIGNIFIED ATTITUDE PAYING THEM THE DEFERENCE WHICH WOULD WIN THEIR GOOD FEELING
2007-149877-0022 WITHOUT IN THE LEAST COMPROMISING HIS OWN BEARING AND OPINIONS THERE WERE IN THE LAST PLACE A FEW GOOD FOLLOWERS NEITHER RICH NOR POOR FAMOUS NOR YET REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL WITH WHOM HE WAS FRIENDLY ON THE SCORE OF GOOD FELLOWSHIP
2007-149877-0023 THESE WERE THE KIND OF MEN WITH WHOM HE WOULD CONVERSE LONGEST AND MOST SERIOUSLY
2007-149877-0024 TO GO TO THE RACES THE THEATRES THE SPORTING ENTERTAINMENTS AT SOME OF THE CLUBS HE KEPT A HORSE AND NEAT TRAP HAD HIS WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE WELL ESTABLISHED IN A NEAT HOUSE ON THE NORTH SIDE NEAR LINCOLN PARK
2007-149877-0025 AND WAS ALTOGETHER A VERY ACCEPTABLE INDIVIDUAL OF OUR GREAT AMERICAN UPPER CLASS THE FIRST GRADE BELOW THE LUXURIOUSLY RICH
2007-149877-0026 THE LATTER'S GENIAL NATURE AND DRESSY APPEARANCE PLEASED HIM HE KNEW THAT DROUET WAS ONLY A TRAVELLING SALESMAN AND NOT ONE OF MANY YEARS AT THAT BUT THE FIRM OF BARTLETT CARYOE AND COMPANY
2007-149877-0027 HURSTWOOD KNEW CARYOE QUITE WELL HAVING DRUNK A GLASS NOW AND THEN WITH HIM IN COMPANY WITH SEVERAL OTHERS WHEN THE CONVERSATION WAS GENERAL
2007-149877-0028 A MODERATE SENSE OF HUMOUR AND COULD TELL A GOOD STORY WHEN THE OCCASION REQUIRED HE COULD TALK RACES WITH HURSTWOOD
2007-149877-0029 AND REPORT THE STATE OF TRADE IN THE CITIES WHICH HE VISITED AND SO MANAGED TO MAKE HIMSELF ALMOST INVARIABLY AGREEABLE TO NIGHT HE WAS PARTICULARLY SO SINCE HIS REPORT TO THE COMPANY HAD BEEN FAVOURABLY COMMENTED UPON
2007-149877-0030 HIS NEW SAMPLES HAD BEEN SATISFACTORILY SELECTED AND HIS TRIP MARKED OUT FOR THE NEXT SIX WEEKS WHY HELLO CHARLIE OLD MAN
2007-149877-0031 HOW GOES IT THE ROOM WAS CROWDED DROUET SHOOK HANDS BEAMING GOOD NATURE AND THEY STROLLED TOWARDS THE BAR OH ALL RIGHT I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN SIX WEEKS WHEN DID YOU GET IN
2007-149877-0032 FRIDAY SAID DROUET HAD A FINE TRIP GLAD OF IT SAID HURSTWOOD HIS BLACK EYES LIT WITH A WARMTH WHICH HALF DISPLACED THE COLD MAKE BELIEVE THAT USUALLY DWELT IN THEM WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO TAKE HE ADDED AS THE BARKEEPER IN SNOWY JACKET AND TIE
2007-149877-0033 LEANED TOWARD THEM FROM BEHIND THE BAR OLD PEPPER SAID DROUET A LITTLE OF THE SAME FOR ME PUT IN HURSTWOOD HOW LONG ARE YOU IN TOWN THIS TIME INQUIRED HURSTWOOD ONLY UNTIL WEDNESDAY I'M GOING UP TO SAINT PAUL

2007-149877-0038 TO ONE NOT INCLINED TO DRINK AND GIFTED WITH A MORE SERIOUS TURN OF MIND SUCH A BUBBLING CHATTERING GLITTERING CHAMBER MUST EVER SEEM AN ANOMALY A STRANGE COMMENTARY ON NATURE AND LIFE
2007-149877-0039 HERE COME THE MOTHS IN ENDLESS PROCESSION TO BASK IN THE LIGHT OF THE FLAME SUCH CONVERSATION AS ONE MAY HEAR WOULD NOT WARRANT A COMMENDATION OF THE SCENE UPON INTELLECTUAL GROUNDS
2007-149877-0040 IT SEEMS PLAIN THAT SCHEMERS WOULD CHOOSE MORE SEQUESTERED QUARTERS TO ARRANGE THEIR PLANS THAT POLITICIANS WOULD NOT GATHER HERE IN COMPANY TO DISCUSS ANYTHING SAVE FORMALITIES WHERE THE SHARP EARED MAY HEAR AND IT WOULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED ON THE SCORE OF THIRST
2007-149877-0041 NEVERTHELESS THE FACT THAT HERE MEN GATHER HERE CHATTER HERE LOVE TO PASS AND RUB ELBOWS MUST BE EXPLAINED UPON SOME GROUNDS IT MUST BE THAT A STRANGE BUNDLE OF PASSIONS AND VAGUE DESIRES
2007-149877-0042 THE MANY FRIENDS HE MET HERE DROPPED IN BECAUSE THEY CRAVED
2007-149877-0043 THE COMPANY THE GLOW THE ATMOSPHERE WHICH THEY FOUND ONE MIGHT TAKE IT AFTER ALL AS AN AUGUR OF THE BETTER SOCIAL ORDER FOR THE THINGS WHICH THEY SATISFIED HERE THOUGH SENSORY WERE NOT EVIL
2007-149877-0044 NO EVIL COULD COME OUT OF THE CONTEMPLATION OF AN EXPENSIVELY DECORATED CHAMBER THE WORST EFFECT OF SUCH A THING WOULD BE PERHAPS TO STIR UP IN THE MATERIAL MINDED AN AMBITION TO ARRANGE THEIR LIVES UPON A SIMILARLY SPLENDID BASIS
2007-149877-0045 IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THAT WOULD SCARCELY BE CALLED THE FAULT OF THE DECORATIONS BUT RATHER OF THE INNATE TREND OF THE MIND THAT SUCH A SCENE MIGHT STIR THE LESS EXPENSIVELY DRESSED TO EMULATE THE MORE EXPENSIVELY DRESSED
2007-149877-0046 COULD SCARCELY BE LAID AT THE DOOR OF ANYTHING SAVE THE FALSE AMBITION OF THE MINDS OF THOSE SO AFFECTED REMOVE THE ELEMENT SO THOROUGHLY AND SOLELY COMPLAINED OF LIQUOR
2007-149877-0047 AND THERE WOULD NOT BE ONE TO GAINSAY THE QUALITIES OF BEAUTY AND ENTHUSIASM WHICH WOULD REMAIN THE PLEASED EYE WITH WHICH OUR MODERN RESTAURANTS OF FASHION ARE LOOKED UPON IS PROOF OF THIS ASSERTION YET HERE IS THE FACT OF THE LIGHTED CHAMBER
2007-149877-0048 THE DRESSY GREEDY COMPANY THE SMALL SELF INTERESTED PALAVER THE DISORGANIZED AIMLESS WANDERING MENTAL ACTION WHICH IT REPRESENTS THE LOVE OF LIGHT AND SHOW AND FINERY WHICH TO ONE OUTSIDE
2007-149877-0049 UNDER THE SERENE LIGHT OF THE ETERNAL STARS MUST SEEM A STRANGE AND SHINY THING UNDER THE STARS AND SWEEPING NIGHT WINDS WHAT A LAMP FLOWER IT MUST BLOOM A

201-122255-0000 THEN UP GOT LITTLE JOHN AND TAKING THE BAG OF GOLD WHICH HE THRUST INTO HIS BOSOM
201-122255-0001 AND ON THE OTHER AS WELL LITTLE JOHN KNEW TO THE MERRY BLUE BOAR INN HERE LITTLE JOHN SUDDENLY CEASED WHISTLING AND STOPPED IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PATH FIRST HE LOOKED UP AND THEN HE LOOKED DOWN AND THEN TILTING HIS CAP OVER ONE EYE HE SLOWLY SCRATCHED THE BACK PART OF HIS HEAD FOR THUS IT WAS
201-122255-0002 AT THE SIGHT OF THESE TWO ROADS TWO VOICES BEGAN TO ALARUM WITHIN HIM THE ONE CRYING THERE LIES THE ROAD TO THE BLUE BOAR INN A CAN OF BROWN OCTOBER AND A MERRY NIGHT WITH SWEET COMPANIONS SUCH AS THOU MAYST FIND THERE THE OTHER
201-122255-0003 LOOKING UP INTO THE BLUE SKY ACROSS WHICH BRIGHT CLOUDS WERE SAILING LIKE SILVER BOATS AND SWALLOWS SKIMMING IN CIRCLING FLIGHT QUOTH HE
201-122255-0004 FOR I KNOW MY GOOD MASTER WOULD NOT HAVE ME WET TO THE SKIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO OFF HE STRODE DOWN THE PATH THAT LAY THE WAY OF HIS LIKINGS NOW THERE WAS NO SIGN OF ANY FOUL WEATHER BUT
201-122255-0005 FRESH CANS OF ALE WERE BROUGHT AND WITH JEST AND SONG AND MERRY TALES THE HOURS SLIPPED AWAY ON FLEETING WINGS NONE THOUGHT OF TIME OR TIDE TILL THE NIGHT WAS SO FAR GONE THAT LITTLE JOHN PUT BY THE THOUGHT OF SETTING FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY AGAIN THAT NIGHT AND SO
201-122255-0006 BIDED AT THE BLUE BOAR INN UNTIL THE MORROW NOW IT WAS AN ILL PIECE OF LUCK FOR LITTLE JOHN THAT HE LEFT HIS DUTY FOR HIS PLEASURE AND HE PAID A GREAT SCORE FOR IT AS WE ARE ALL APT TO DO IN THE SAME CASE AS YOU SHALL SEE
201-122255-0007 AND TAKING HIS STOUT PIKESTAFF IN HIS HAND HE SET FORTH UPON HIS JOURNEY ONCE MORE AS THOUGH HE WOULD MAKE UP FOR LOST TIME IN THE GOOD TOWN OF BLYTH THERE LIVED A STOUT TANNER CELEBRATED FAR AND NEAR FOR FEATS OF STRENGTH AND MANY TOUGH BOUTS AT WRESTLING AND THE QUARTERSTAFF
201-122255-0008 BESIDES ALL THIS HE DEARLY LOVED THE LONGBOW
201-122255-0009 SO THAT THE KING'S RANGERS KEPT A SHREWD EYE UPON HIM AND HIS DOINGS FOR ARTHUR A BLAND'S HOUSE WAS APT TO HAVE APLENTY OF MEAT IN IT THAT WAS MORE LIKE VENISON THAN THE LAW ALLOWED NOW ARTHUR HAD BEEN TO NOTTINGHAM TOWN THE DAY BEFORE LITTLE JOHN SET FORTH ON HIS ERRAND
201-122255-0010 THERE TO SELL A HALFSCORE OF TANNED COWHIDES AT THE DAWN OF THE SAME DAY THAT LITTLE JOHN LEFT THE INN HE STARTED FROM NOTTINGHAM HOMEWARD FOR BLYTH HIS WAY LED ALL IN THE DEWY MORN PAST THE VERGE OF SHERWOOD FOREST WHERE THE BIRDS WERE WELCOMING THE LOVELY DAY WITH A GREAT AND MERRY JUBILEE
201-122255-0011 ACROSS THE TANNER'S SHOULDERS WAS SLUNG HIS STOUT QUARTERSTAFF EVER NEAR ENOUGH TO HIM TO BE GRIPPED QUICKLY AND ON HIS HEAD WAS A CAP OF DOUBLED COWHIDE SO TOUGH THAT IT COULD HARDLY BE CLOVEN EVEN BY A BROADSWORD NOW QUOTH ARTHUR A BLAND TO HIMSELF
201-122255-0012 MAYHAP I MAY CHANCE TO CATCH A SIGHT OF THE DAINTY BROWN DARLINGS THUS EARLY IN THE MORN FOR THERE WAS NOTHING HE LOVED BETTER THAN TO LOOK UPON A TRIPPING HERD OF DEER
201-122255-0013 ACCORDINGLY QUITTING THE PATH HE WENT PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE UNDERBRUSH SPYING NOW HERE AND NOW THERE WITH ALL THE WILES OF A MASTER OF WOODCRAFT AND OF ONE WHO HAD MORE THAN ONCE DONNED A DOUBLET OF LINCOLN GREEN
201-122255-0014 THAT SPRINGING FROM THE DEWY GRASS HUNG ALOFT ON QUIVERING WINGS IN THE YELLOW SUNLIGHT POURING FORTH ITS SONG THAT FELL LIKE A FALLING STAR FROM THE SKY HIS LUCK LED HIM AWAY FROM THE HIGHWAY NOT FAR FROM THE SPOT WHERE ARTHUR A BLAND WAS PEEPING THIS WAY AND THAT THROUGH THE LEAVES OF THE THICKETS
201-122255-0015 HEARING A RUSTLING OF THE BRANCHES LITTLE JOHN STOPPED AND PRESENTLY CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE BROWN COWHIDE CAP OF THE TANNER MOVING AMONG THE BUSHES I DO MUCH WONDER
201-122255-0016 QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TO HIMSELF WHAT YON KNAVE IS AFTER THAT HE SHOULD GO THUS PEEPING AND PEERING ABOUT I VERILY BELIEVE THAT YON SCURVY VARLET IS NO BETTER THAN A THIEF AND COMETH HERE AFTER OUR OWN AND THE GOOD KING'S DUN DEER FOR
201-122255-0017 BY MUCH ROVING IN THE FOREST LITTLE JOHN HAD COME TO LOOK UPON ALL THE DEER IN SHERWOOD AS BELONGING TO ROBIN HOOD AND HIS BAND AS MUCH AS TO GOOD KING HARRY NAY
201-122255-0018 LITTLE JOHN TROD UPON A STICK WHICH SNAPPED UNDER HIS FOOT WHEREUPON HEARING THE NOISE THE TANNER TURNED QUICKLY AND CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE YEOMAN SEEING THAT THE TANNER HAD SPIED HIM OUT LITTLE JOHN PUT A BOLD FACE UPON THE MATTER
201-122255-0019 BUT AN HONEST CRAFTSMAN AS FOR MY COUNTENANCE IT IS WHAT IT IS AND FOR THE MATTER OF THAT THINE OWN IS NONE TOO PRETTY THOU SAUCY FELLOW HA QUOTH LITTLE JOHN IN A GREAT LOUD VOICE WOULDST THOU GIVE ME BACKTALK
201-122255-0020 I AND MY FRIENDS DO TAKE GOOD CARE OF OUR GOOD SOVEREIGN'S DEER I CARE NOT WHO THOU ART ANSWERED THE BOLD TANNER AND UNLESS THOU HAST MANY MORE OF THY KIND BY THEE THOU CANST NEVER MAKE ARTHUR A BLAND CRY A MERCY
201-122255-0021 FOR I WILL GIVE THEE SUCH A DRUBBING AS NE'ER HAST THOU HAD IN ALL THY LIFE BEFORE TAKE THY STAFF IN THY HAND FELLOW FOR I WILL NOT SMITE AN UNARMED MAN
201-122255-0022 FOR HE TOO HAD TALKED HIMSELF INTO A FUME BIG WORDS NE'ER KILLED SO MUCH AS A MOUSE WHO ART THOU THAT TALKEST SO FREELY OF CRACKING THE HEAD OF ARTHUR A BLAND IF I DO NOT TAN THY HIDE THIS DAY AS NE'ER I TANNED A CALF'S HIDE IN ALL MY LIFE BEFORE
201-122255-0023 NAY I PASS NOT FOR LENGTH ANSWERED THE TANNER MY STAFF IS LONG ENOUGH TO KNOCK DOWN A CALF SO LOOK TO THYSELF FELLOW I SAY AGAIN SO WITHOUT MORE ADO EACH GRIPPED HIS STAFF IN THE MIDDLE AND WITH FELL AND ANGRY LOOKS THEY CAME SLOWLY TOGETHER
201-122255-0024 NOW NEWS HAD BEEN BROUGHT TO ROBIN HOOD HOW THAT LITTLE JOHN INSTEAD OF DOING HIS BIDDING HAD PASSED BY DUTY FOR PLEASURE AND SO HAD STOPPED OVERNIGHT WITH MERRY COMPANY AT THE BLUE BOAR INN INSTEAD OF GOING STRAIGHT TO ANCASTER
201-122255-0025 SO BEING VEXED TO HIS HEART BY THIS HE SET FORTH AT DAWN OF DAY TO SEEK LITTLE JOHN AT THE BLUE BOAR OR AT LEAST TO MEET THE YEOMAN ON THE WAY AND EASE HIS HEART OF WHAT HE THOUGHT OF THE MATTER
201-122255-0026 AS THUS HE STRODE ALONG IN ANGER PUTTING TOGETHER THE WORDS HE WOULD USE TO CHIDE LITTLE JOHN HE HEARD OF A SUDDEN LOUD AND ANGRY VOICES
201-122255-0027 AT THIS ROBIN HOOD STOPPED AND LISTENED SURELY QUOTH HE TO HIMSELF THAT IS LITTLE JOHN'S VOICE AND HE IS TALKING IN ANGER ALSO METHINKS THE OTHER IS STRANGE TO MY EARS
201-122255-0028 NOW HEAVEN FORFEND THAT MY GOOD TRUSTY LITTLE JOHN SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO THE HANDS OF THE KING'S RANGERS I MUST SEE TO THIS MATTER AND THAT QUICKLY THUS SPOKE ROBIN HOOD TO HIMSELF ALL HIS ANGER PASSING AWAY LIKE A BREATH FROM THE WINDOWPANE
201-122255-0029 AT THE THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HIS TRUSTY RIGHT HAND MAN WAS IN SOME DANGER OF HIS LIFE SO CAUTIOUSLY
201-122255-0030 HA QUOTH ROBIN TO HIMSELF HERE IS MERRY SPORT AFOOT NOW I WOULD GIVE THREE GOLDEN ANGELS FROM MY OWN POCKET IF YON STOUT FELLOW WOULD GIVE LITTLE JOHN A RIGHT SOUND DRUBBING IT WOULD PLEASE ME TO SEE HIM WELL THUMPED FOR HAVING FAILED IN MY BIDDING
201-122255-0031 I FEAR ME THOUGH THERE IS BUT POOR CHANCE OF MY SEEING SUCH A PLEASANT SIGHT SO SAYING HE STRETCHED HIMSELF AT LENGTH UPON THE GROUND THAT HE MIGHT NOT ONLY SEE THE SPORT THE BETTER BUT THAT HE MIGHT ENJOY THE MERRY SIGHT AT HIS EASE
201-122255-0032 EACH WATCHING FOR A CHANCE TO TAKE THE OTHER UNAWARE AND SO GET IN THE FIRST BLOW AT LAST LITTLE JOHN STRUCK LIKE A FLASH AND RAP THE TANNER MET THE BLOW AND TURNED IT ASIDE AND THEN SMOTE BACK AT LITTLE JOHN WHO ALSO TURNED THE BLOW AND SO THIS MIGHTY BATTLE BEGAN
201-122255-0033 NEVER HAD I THOUGHT TO SEE LITTLE JOHN SO EVENLY MATCHED IN ALL MY LIFE BELIKE THOUGH
201-122255-0034 HIS CUDGEL FLYING FROM HIS HAND AS HE FELL THEN RAISING HIS STAFF STOUT ARTHUR DEALT HIM ANOTHER BLOW UPON THE RIBS HOLD ROARED LITTLE JOHN
201-122255-0035 HAST THOU HAD ENOUGH ASKED THE TANNER GRIMLY HOLDING HIS STAFF ALOFT AY MARRY AND MORE THAN ENOUGH AND THOU DOST OWN THAT I AM THE BETTER MAN OF THE TWO YEA TRULY AND A MURRAIN SEIZE THEE
201-122255-0036 SAID LITTLE JOHN SITTING UP AND FEELING HIS RIBS WHERE THE TANNER HAD CUDGELED HIM I MAKE MY VOW MY RIBS FEEL AS THOUGH EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE BROKEN IN TWAIN
201-122255-0037 I DID THINK THERE WAS NEVER A MAN IN ALL NOTTINGHAMSHIRE COULD DO TO ME WHAT THOU HAST DONE THIS DAY AND SO THOUGHT I ALSO CRIED ROBIN HOOD BURSTING OUT OF THE THICKET AND SHOUTING WITH LAUGHTER TILL THE TEARS RAN DOWN HIS CHEEKS
201-122255-0038 HAND AND FOOT TO ANY MAN IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND I WAS SEEKING THEE TO CHIDE THEE FOR LEAVING MY BIDDING UNDONE BUT THOU HAST BEEN PAID ALL I OWED THEE
201-122255-0039 MARRY A DID REACH OUT HIS ARM FULL LENGTH WHILE THOU STOOD GAPING AT HIM AND WITH A PRETTY RAP TUMBLED THEE OVER AS NEVER HAVE I SEEN ONE TUMBLED BEFORE SO SPOKE BOLD ROBIN
201-122255-0040 AND NOW WHAT MAY BE THY NAME HA ARTHUR A BLAND QUOTH ROBIN I HAVE HEARD THY NAME BEFORE GOOD FELLOW THOU DIDST BREAK THE CROWN OF A FRIEND OF MINE AT THE FAIR AT ELY LAST OCTOBER THE FOLK THERE CALL HIM JOCK O NOTTINGHAM WE CALL HIM WILL SCATHELOCK
201-122255-0041 THIS POOR FELLOW WHOM THOU HAST SO BELABORED IS COUNTED THE BEST HAND AT THE QUARTERSTAFF IN ALL MERRY ENGLAND HIS NAME IS LITTLE JOHN AND MINE ROBIN HOOD
201-122255-0042 NAY QUOTH LITTLE JOHN TESTILY AT THE SAME TIME RISING CAREFULLY AS THOUGH HIS BONES HAD BEEN MADE OF GLASS I CAN HELP MYSELF GOOD FELLOW WITHOUT THY AID AND LET ME TELL THEE HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THAT VILE COWSKIN CAP OF THINE
201-122255-0043 I WILL FOLLOW THEE TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH GOOD MASTER AND NOT A HERD OF DUN DEER IN ALL THE FOREST BUT SHALL KNOW THE SOUND OF THE TWANG OF MY BOWSTRING AS FOR THEE LITTLE JOHN SAID ROBIN TURNING TO HIM AND LAUGHING
201-122255-0044 THERE ARE OTHER INNS THAT THOU KNOWEST YET HEREABOUTS
201-127786-0000 HAPPY AND FORTUNATE WERE THE TIMES WHEN THAT MOST DARING KNIGHT DON QUIXOTE OF LA MANCHA WAS SENT INTO THE WORLD
201-127786-0001 BUT ALSO OF THE TALES AND EPISODES CONTAINED IN IT WHICH ARE IN A MEASURE NO LESS PLEASING INGENIOUS AND TRUTHFUL THAN THE HISTORY ITSELF WHICH RESUMING ITS THREAD CARDED SPUN AND WOUND RELATES THAT JUST AS THE CURATE WAS GOING TO OFFER CONSOLATION TO CARDENIO
201-127786-0002 ALL THIS WAS HEARD DISTINCTLY BY THE CURATE AND THOSE WITH HIM AND AS IT SEEMED TO THEM TO BE UTTERED CLOSE BY AS INDEED IT WAS THEY GOT UP TO LOOK FOR THE SPEAKER AND BEFORE THEY HAD GONE TWENTY PACES THEY DISCOVERED BEHIND A ROCK SEATED AT THE FOOT OF AN ASH TREE
201-127786-0003 A YOUTH IN THE DRESS OF A PEASANT WHOSE FACE THEY WERE UNABLE AT THE MOMENT TO SEE AS HE WAS LEANING FORWARD BATHING HIS FEET IN THE BROOK THAT FLOWED PAST THEY APPROACHED SO SILENTLY THAT HE DID NOT PERCEIVE THEM BEING FULLY OCCUPIED IN BATHING HIS FEET
201-127786-0004 CRUSH CLODS OR TO FOLLOW THE PLOUGH AND THE OXEN AS THEIR OWNER'S DRESS SUGGESTED AND SO FINDING THEY HAD NOT BEEN NOTICED THE CURATE WHO WAS IN FRONT MADE A SIGN TO THE OTHER TWO TO CONCEAL THEMSELVES BEHIND SOME FRAGMENTS OF ROCK THAT LAY THERE
201-127786-0005 WHICH THEY DID OBSERVING CLOSELY WHAT THE YOUTH WAS ABOUT HE HAD ON A LOOSE DOUBLE SKIRTED DARK BROWN JACKET BOUND TIGHT TO HIS BODY WITH A WHITE CLOTH HE WORE BESIDES BREECHES AND GAITERS OF BROWN CLOTH AND ON HIS HEAD A BROWN MONTERA AND
201-127786-0006 AS THIS IS NOT LUSCINDA IT IS NO HUMAN CREATURE BUT A DIVINE BEING THE YOUTH THEN TOOK OFF THE MONTERA AND SHAKING HIS HEAD FROM SIDE TO SIDE THERE BROKE LOOSE AND SPREAD OUT A MASS OF HAIR THAT THE BEAMS OF THE SUN MIGHT HAVE ENVIED
201-127786-0007 BY THIS THEY KNEW THAT WHAT HAD SEEMED A PEASANT WAS A LOVELY WOMAN NAY THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THE EYES OF TWO OF THEM HAD EVER BEHELD OR EVEN CARDENIO'S IF THEY HAD NOT SEEN AND KNOWN LUSCINDA
201-127786-0008 THE LONG AUBURN TRESSES NOT ONLY COVERED HER SHOULDERS BUT SUCH WAS THEIR LENGTH AND ABUNDANCE CONCEALED HER ALL ROUND BENEATH THEIR MASSES SO THAT EXCEPT THE FEET NOTHING OF HER FORM WAS VISIBLE SHE NOW USED HER HANDS AS A COMB
201-127786-0009 AND IF HER FEET HAD SEEMED LIKE BITS OF CRYSTAL IN THE WATER HER HANDS LOOKED LIKE PIECES OF DRIVEN SNOW AMONG HER LOCKS ALL WHICH INCREASED NOT ONLY THE ADMIRATION OF THE THREE BEHOLDERS BUT THEIR ANXIETY TO LEARN WHO SHE WAS WITH THIS OBJECT THEY RESOLVED TO SHOW THEMSELVES
201-127786-0010 HER DELICATE FEET BEING UNABLE TO BEAR THE ROUGHNESS OF THE STONES SEEING WHICH THE THREE HASTENED TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE ADDRESSING HER FIRST SAID STAY SENORA WHOEVER YOU MAY BE FOR THOSE WHOM YOU SEE HERE ONLY DESIRE TO BE OF SERVICE TO YOU
201-127786-0011 YOU HAVE NO NEED TO ATTEMPT A FLIGHT SO HEEDLESS FOR NEITHER CAN YOUR FEET BEAR IT NOR WE ALLOW IT TAKEN BY SURPRISE AND BEWILDERED SHE MADE NO REPLY TO THESE WORDS THEY HOWEVER CAME TOWARDS HER AND THE CURATE TAKING HER HAND WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0012 WHAT YOUR DRESS WOULD HIDE SENORA IS MADE KNOWN TO US BY YOUR HAIR A CLEAR PROOF THAT IT CAN BE NO TRIFLING CAUSE THAT HAS DISGUISED YOUR BEAUTY IN A GARB SO UNWORTHY OF IT AND SENT IT INTO SOLITUDES LIKE THESE WHERE WE HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO FIND YOU
201-127786-0013 IF NOT TO RELIEVE YOUR DISTRESS AT LEAST TO OFFER YOU COMFORT FOR NO DISTRESS SO LONG AS LIFE LASTS CAN BE SO OPPRESSIVE OR REACH SUCH A HEIGHT AS TO MAKE THE SUFFERER REFUSE TO LISTEN TO COMFORT OFFERED WITH GOOD INTENTION AND SO SENORA
201-127786-0014 BUT ON THE CURATE ADDRESSING SOME FURTHER WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT TO HER SIGHING DEEPLY SHE BROKE SILENCE AND SAID SINCE THE SOLITUDE OF THESE MOUNTAINS HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONCEAL ME AND THE ESCAPE OF MY DISHEVELLED TRESSES WILL NOT ALLOW MY TONGUE TO DEAL IN FALSEHOODS
201-127786-0015 IT WOULD BE IDLE FOR ME NOW TO MAKE ANY FURTHER PRETENCE OF WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BELIEVE ME YOU WOULD BELIEVE MORE OUT OF COURTESY THAN FOR ANY OTHER REASON
201-127786-0016 THIS BEING SO I SAY I THANK YOU SIRS FOR THE OFFER YOU HAVE MADE ME WHICH PLACES ME UNDER THE OBLIGATION OF COMPLYING WITH THE REQUEST YOU HAVE MADE OF ME THOUGH I FEAR THE ACCOUNT I SHALL GIVE YOU OF MY MISFORTUNES WILL EXCITE IN YOU AS MUCH CONCERN AS COMPASSION
201-127786-0017 FOR YOU WILL BE UNABLE TO SUGGEST ANYTHING TO REMEDY THEM OR ANY CONSOLATION TO ALLEVIATE THEM HOWEVER THAT MY HONOUR MAY NOT BE LEFT A MATTER OF DOUBT IN YOUR MINDS NOW THAT YOU HAVE DISCOVERED ME TO BE A WOMAN
201-127786-0018 I FEEL BOUND TO TELL WHAT I WOULD WILLINGLY KEEP SECRET IF I COULD ALL THIS SHE WHO WAS NOW SEEN TO BE A LOVELY WOMAN DELIVERED WITHOUT ANY HESITATION WITH SO MUCH EASE AND IN SO SWEET A VOICE THAT THEY WERE NOT LESS CHARMED BY HER INTELLIGENCE THAN BY HER BEAUTY
201-127786-0019 AND AS THEY AGAIN REPEATED THEIR OFFERS AND ENTREATIES TO HER TO FULFIL HER PROMISE SHE WITHOUT FURTHER PRESSING FIRST MODESTLY COVERING HER FEET AND GATHERING UP HER HAIR SEATED HERSELF ON A STONE WITH THE THREE PLACED AROUND HER AND
201-127786-0020 AFTER AN EFFORT TO RESTRAIN SOME TEARS THAT CAME TO HER EYES IN A CLEAR AND STEADY VOICE BEGAN HER STORY THUS
201-127786-0021 LOWLY IN ORIGIN BUT SO WEALTHY THAT IF BIRTH HAD CONFERRED AS MUCH ON THEM AS FORTUNE THEY WOULD HAVE HAD NOTHING LEFT TO DESIRE NOR SHOULD I HAVE HAD REASON TO FEAR TROUBLE LIKE THAT IN WHICH I FIND MYSELF NOW
201-127786-0022 FOR IT MAY BE THAT MY ILL FORTUNE CAME OF THEIRS IN NOT HAVING BEEN NOBLY BORN IT IS TRUE THEY ARE NOT SO LOW THAT THEY HAVE ANY REASON TO BE ASHAMED OF THEIR CONDITION
201-127786-0023 THEY ARE IN SHORT PEASANTS
201-127786-0024 AND AS THE SAYING IS OLD RUSTY CHRISTIANS BUT SO RICH THAT BY THEIR WEALTH AND FREE HANDED WAY OF LIFE THEY ARE COMING BY DEGREES TO BE CONSIDERED GENTLEFOLK BY BIRTH AND EVEN BY POSITION
201-127786-0025 AND AS THEY HAVE NO OTHER CHILD TO MAKE THEIR HEIR AND ARE AFFECTIONATE PARENTS I WAS ONE OF THE MOST INDULGED DAUGHTERS THAT EVER PARENTS INDULGED
201-127786-0026 ALL THEIR WISHES CENTRED AND MINE WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIRS FOR I KNEW THEIR WORTH AND AS I WAS MISTRESS OF THEIR HEARTS SO WAS I ALSO OF THEIR POSSESSIONS THROUGH ME THEY ENGAGED OR DISMISSED THEIR SERVANTS
201-127786-0027 THROUGH MY HANDS PASSED THE ACCOUNTS AND RETURNS OF WHAT WAS SOWN AND REAPED THE OIL MILLS THE WINE PRESSES THE COUNT OF THE FLOCKS AND HERDS THE BEEHIVES ALL IN SHORT THAT A RICH FARMER LIKE MY FATHER HAS OR CAN HAVE I HAD UNDER MY CARE
201-127786-0028 FOR EXPERIENCE TAUGHT ME THAT MUSIC SOOTHES THE TROUBLED MIND AND RELIEVES WEARINESS OF SPIRIT SUCH WAS THE LIFE I LED IN MY PARENTS HOUSE AND IF I HAVE DEPICTED IT THUS MINUTELY IT IS NOT OUT OF OSTENTATION OR TO LET YOU KNOW THAT I AM RICH BUT
201-127786-0029 AND UNSEEN AS I THOUGHT BY ANY EXCEPT THE SERVANTS OF THE HOUSE FOR WHEN I WENT TO MASS IT WAS SO EARLY IN THE MORNING AND I WAS SO CLOSELY ATTENDED BY MY MOTHER AND THE WOMEN OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND
201-127786-0030 FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THE YOUNGER SON OF THE DUKE I TOLD OF THE MOMENT THE SPEAKER MENTIONED THE NAME OF DON FERNANDO
201-127786-0031 FOR HE BEGAN TO SUSPECT WHO SHE WAS SHE HOWEVER WITHOUT NOTICING THE EXCITEMENT OF CARDENIO CONTINUING HER STORY WENT ON TO SAY
201-127786-0032 AND I WAS NOT DISPLEASED AT SEEING MY PRAISES IN HIS LETTERS FOR HOWEVER UGLY WE WOMEN MAY BE IT SEEMS TO ME IT ALWAYS PLEASES US TO HEAR OURSELVES CALLED BEAUTIFUL BUT THAT MY OWN SENSE OF RIGHT WAS OPPOSED TO ALL THIS
201-127786-0033 AS WELL AS THE REPEATED ADVICE OF MY PARENTS WHO NOW VERY PLAINLY PERCEIVED DON FERNANDO'S PURPOSE FOR HE CARED VERY LITTLE IF ALL THE WORLD KNEW IT THEY TOLD ME THEY TRUSTED AND CONFIDED THEIR HONOUR AND GOOD NAME TO MY VIRTUE
201-127786-0034 AND RECTITUDE ALONE AND BADE ME CONSIDER THE DISPARITY BETWEEN DON FERNANDO AND MYSELF FROM WHICH I MIGHT CONCLUDE THAT HIS INTENTIONS WHATEVER HE MIGHT SAY TO THE CONTRARY HAD FOR THEIR AIM HIS OWN PLEASURE RATHER THAN MY ADVANTAGE
201-127786-0035 AND IF I WERE AT ALL DESIROUS OF OPPOSING AN OBSTACLE TO HIS UNREASONABLE SUIT THEY WERE READY THEY SAID TO MARRY ME AT ONCE TO ANYONE I PREFERRED EITHER AMONG THE LEADING PEOPLE OF OUR OWN TOWN OR
201-127786-0036 AND I NEVER GAVE DON FERNANDO A WORD IN REPLY THAT COULD HOLD OUT TO HIM ANY HOPE OF SUCCESS HOWEVER REMOTE ALL THIS CAUTION OF MINE WHICH HE MUST HAVE TAKEN FOR COYNESS HAD APPARENTLY THE EFFECT OF INCREASING HIS WANTON APPETITE FOR
201-127786-0037 OR AT LEAST TO SECURE ADDITIONAL PROTECTORS TO WATCH OVER ME AND THIS INTELLIGENCE OR SUSPICION MADE HIM ACT AS YOU SHALL HEAR ONE NIGHT AS I WAS IN MY CHAMBER WITH NO OTHER COMPANION THAN A DAMSEL WHO WAITED ON ME WITH
201-127786-0038 I HAD NO POWER TO UTTER A CRY NOR I THINK DID HE GIVE ME TIME TO UTTER ONE AS HE IMMEDIATELY APPROACHED ME AND TAKING ME IN HIS ARMS FOR OVERWHELMED AS I WAS I WAS POWERLESS I SAY TO HELP MYSELF HE BEGAN TO MAKE SUCH
201-127786-0039 PROFESSIONS TO ME THAT I KNOW NOT HOW FALSEHOOD COULD HAVE HAD THE POWER OF DRESSING THEM UP TO SEEM SO LIKE TRUTH AND THE TRAITOR CONTRIVED THAT HIS TEARS SHOULD VOUCH FOR HIS WORDS AND HIS SIGHS FOR HIS SINCERITY
201-127786-0040 AND I BEGAN IN SOME DEGREE TO RECOVER MYSELF I SAID TO HIM WITH MORE COURAGE THAN I THOUGHT I COULD HAVE POSSESSED
201-127786-0041 I HAVE MY SELF RESPECT AS MUCH AS YOU A LORD AND GENTLEMAN WITH ME YOUR VIOLENCE WILL BE TO NO PURPOSE YOUR WEALTH WILL HAVE NO WEIGHT YOUR WORDS WILL HAVE NO POWER TO DECEIVE ME NOR YOUR SIGHS OR TEARS TO SOFTEN ME
201-127786-0042 WERE I TO SEE ANY OF THE THINGS I SPEAK OF IN HIM WHOM MY PARENTS GAVE ME AS A HUSBAND HIS WILL SHOULD BE MINE AND MINE SHOULD BE BOUNDED BY HIS AND MY HONOUR BEING PRESERVED EVEN THOUGH MY INCLINATIONS WERE NOT
201-127786-0043 AND THIS I SAY LEST YOU SHOULD SUPPOSE THAT ANY BUT MY LAWFUL HUSBAND SHALL EVER WIN ANYTHING OF ME IF THAT
201-127786-0044 BE THE ONLY SCRUPLE YOU FEEL FAIREST DOROTHEA FOR THAT IS THE NAME OF THIS UNHAPPY BEING SEE HERE I GIVE YOU MY HAND TO BE YOURS AND LET HEAVEN
201-127786-0045 BUT HE WAS UNWILLING TO INTERRUPT THE STORY AND WISHED TO HEAR THE END OF WHAT HE ALREADY ALL BUT KNEW SO HE MERELY SAID WHAT
201-127786-0046 I HAVE HEARD OF ANOTHER OF THE SAME NAME WHO CAN PERHAPS MATCH YOUR MISFORTUNES BUT PROCEED BY AND BY I MAY TELL YOU SOMETHING THAT WILL ASTONISH YOU AS MUCH AS IT WILL EXCITE YOUR COMPASSION DOROTHEA WAS STRUCK BY CARDENIO'S WORDS AS WELL AS BY HIS STRANGE AND MISERABLE ATTIRE
201-127786-0047 AND BEGGED HIM IF HE KNEW ANYTHING CONCERNING HER TO TELL IT TO HER AT ONCE FOR IF FORTUNE HAD LEFT HER ANY BLESSING IT WAS COURAGE TO BEAR WHATEVER CALAMITY MIGHT FALL UPON HER AS SHE FELT SURE THAT NONE COULD REACH HER CAPABLE OF INCREASING IN ANY DEGREE WHAT SHE ENDURED ALREADY
201-127786-0048 I WOULD NOT LET THE OCCASION PASS SENORA REPLIED CARDENIO OF TELLING YOU WHAT I THINK
201-127786-0049 AND ONE OF HIS VASSALS I TOLD HIM NOT TO LET MY BEAUTY SUCH AS IT WAS BLIND HIM
201-127786-0050 FOR MARRIAGES SO UNEQUAL NEVER BROUGHT HAPPINESS NOR DID THEY CONTINUE LONG TO AFFORD THE ENJOYMENT THEY BEGAN WITH ALL THIS THAT I HAVE NOW REPEATED I SAID TO HIM AND MUCH MORE WHICH I CANNOT RECOLLECT BUT IT HAD NO EFFECT IN INDUCING HIM TO FOREGO HIS PURPOSE
201-127786-0051 AT THE SAME TIME I ARGUED THE MATTER BRIEFLY IN MY OWN MIND SAYING TO MYSELF I SHALL NOT BE THE FIRST WHO HAS RISEN THROUGH MARRIAGE FROM A LOWLY TO A LOFTY STATION NOR WILL DON FERNANDO BE THE FIRST WHOM BEAUTY OR AS IS MORE LIKELY A BLIND ATTACHMENT
201-127786-0052 HAS LED TO MATE HIMSELF BELOW HIS RANK THEN SINCE I AM INTRODUCING NO NEW USAGE OR PRACTICE
201-127786-0053 PASSED THROUGH MY MIND IN A MOMENT BUT THE OATHS OF DON FERNANDO THE WITNESSES HE APPEALED TO THE TEARS HE SHED AND LASTLY THE CHARMS OF HIS PERSON AND HIS HIGH BRED GRACE WHICH ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH SIGNS OF GENUINE LOVE
201-127786-0054 THESE WERE THE THINGS THAT MORE THAN ALL BEGAN TO INFLUENCE ME AND LEAD ME UNAWARES TO MY RUIN I CALLED MY WAITING MAID TO ME THAT THERE MIGHT BE A WITNESS ON EARTH BESIDES THOSE IN HEAVEN AND AGAIN DON FERNANDO RENEWED AND REPEATED HIS OATHS
201-127786-0055 CALLED DOWN UPON HIMSELF A THOUSAND CURSES HEREAFTER SHOULD HE FAIL TO KEEP HIS PROMISE SHED MORE TEARS REDOUBLED HIS SIGHS
201-127786-0056 AND SO I WAS LEFT BY MY MAID AND CEASED TO BE ONE AND HE BECAME A TRAITOR AND A PERJURED MAN THE DAY WHICH FOLLOWED THE NIGHT OF MY MISFORTUNE DID NOT COME SO QUICKLY I IMAGINE AS DON FERNANDO WISHED
201-127786-0057 WHO WAS INDEED THE ONE WHO HAD ADMITTED HIM GAINED THE STREET BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT ON TAKING LEAVE OF ME HE TOLD ME THOUGH NOT WITH AS MUCH EARNESTNESS AND FERVOUR AS WHEN HE CAME THAT I MIGHT REST ASSURED OF HIS FAITH AND OF THE SANCTITY AND SINCERITY OF HIS OATHS
201-127786-0058 AND TO CONFIRM HIS WORDS HE DREW A RICH RING OFF HIS FINGER AND PLACED IT UPON MINE HE THEN TOOK HIS DEPARTURE AND I WAS LEFT I KNOW NOT WHETHER SORROWFUL OR HAPPY ALL I CAN SAY IS I WAS LEFT AGITATED AND TROUBLED IN MIND AND ALMOST BEWILDERED BY WHAT HAD TAKEN PLACE
201-127786-0059 AND I HAD NOT THE SPIRIT OR ELSE IT DID NOT OCCUR TO ME TO CHIDE MY MAID FOR THE TREACHERY SHE HAD BEEN GUILTY OF IN CONCEALING DON FERNANDO IN MY CHAMBER FOR AS YET I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE UP MY MIND WHETHER WHAT HAD BEFALLEN ME WAS FOR GOOD OR EVIL
201-127786-0060 I TOLD DON FERNANDO AT PARTING THAT AS I WAS NOW HIS HE MIGHT SEE ME ON OTHER NIGHTS IN THE SAME WAY UNTIL IT SHOULD BE HIS PLEASURE TO LET THE MATTER BECOME KNOWN BUT EXCEPT THE FOLLOWING NIGHT HE CAME NO MORE NOR FOR MORE THAN A MONTH COULD I CATCH A GLIMPSE OF HIM IN THE STREET OR IN CHURCH
201-127786-0061 WHILE I WEARIED MYSELF WITH WATCHING FOR ONE
201-127786-0062 I REMEMBER TOO HOW MY MAID HEARD THOSE WORDS IN REPROOF OF HER AUDACITY THAT SHE HAD NOT HEARD BEFORE AND HOW I WAS FORCED TO PUT A CONSTRAINT ON MY TEARS AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF MY COUNTENANCE NOT TO GIVE MY PARENTS CAUSE TO ASK ME WHY I WAS SO MELANCHOLY
201-127786-0063 AND DRIVE ME TO INVENT FALSEHOODS IN REPLY BUT ALL THIS WAS SUDDENLY BROUGHT TO AN END FOR THE TIME CAME WHEN ALL SUCH CONSIDERATIONS WERE DISREGARDED AND THERE WAS NO FURTHER QUESTION OF HONOUR WHEN MY PATIENCE GAVE WAY AND THE SECRET OF MY HEART BECAME KNOWN ABROAD
201-127786-0064 IT WAS SAID TOO THAT HER NAME WAS LUSCINDA AND THAT AT THE BETROTHAL SOME STRANGE THINGS HAD HAPPENED
201-127786-0065 DOROTHEA HOWEVER DID NOT INTERRUPT HER STORY BUT WENT ON IN THESE WORDS THIS SAD INTELLIGENCE REACHED MY EARS
201-127786-0066 AND WHOM I ENTREATED TO ACCOMPANY ME TO THE CITY WHERE I HEARD MY ENEMY WAS
201-127786-0067 AN AFFAIR OF SUCH NOTORIETY IN THE CITY THAT IT WAS THE TALK OF EVERY KNOT OF IDLERS IN THE STREET HE SAID THAT ON THE NIGHT OF DON FERNANDO'S BETROTHAL WITH LUSCINDA AS SOON AS SHE HAD CONSENTED TO BE HIS BRIDE BY SAYING YES SHE WAS TAKEN WITH A SUDDEN FAINTING FIT
201-127786-0068 AND THAT ON THE BRIDEGROOM APPROACHING TO UNLACE THE BOSOM OF HER DRESS TO GIVE HER AIR
201-127786-0069 ON SEEING THIS DON FERNANDO PERSUADED THAT LUSCINDA HAD BEFOOLED SLIGHTED AND TRIFLED WITH HIM ASSAILED HER BEFORE SHE HAD RECOVERED FROM HER SWOON AND TRIED TO STAB HER WITH THE DAGGER THAT HAD BEEN FOUND AND WOULD HAVE SUCCEEDED HAD NOT HER PARENTS AND THOSE WHO WERE PRESENT PREVENTED HIM
201-127786-0070 IT WAS SAID MOREOVER THAT DON FERNANDO WENT AWAY AT ONCE AND THAT LUSCINDA DID NOT RECOVER FROM HER PROSTRATION UNTIL THE NEXT DAY WHEN SHE TOLD HER PARENTS HOW SHE WAS REALLY THE BRIDE OF THAT CARDENIO I HAVE MENTIONED I LEARNED BESIDES THAT CARDENIO
201-127786-0071 ACCORDING TO REPORT HAD BEEN PRESENT AT THE BETROTHAL AND THAT UPON SEEING HER BETROTHED CONTRARY TO HIS EXPECTATION HE HAD QUITTED THE CITY IN DESPAIR LEAVING BEHIND HIM A LETTER DECLARING THE WRONG LUSCINDA HAD DONE HIM AND HIS INTENTION OF GOING WHERE NO ONE SHOULD EVER SEE HIM AGAIN
201-127786-0072 ALL THIS WAS A MATTER OF NOTORIETY IN THE CITY AND EVERYONE SPOKE OF IT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT BECAME KNOWN THAT LUSCINDA WAS MISSING FROM HER FATHER'S HOUSE AND FROM THE CITY FOR SHE WAS NOT TO BE FOUND ANYWHERE TO THE DISTRACTION OF HER PARENTS WHO KNEW NOT WHAT STEPS TO TAKE TO RECOVER HER WHAT I LEARNED
201-127786-0073 REVIVED MY HOPES AND I WAS BETTER PLEASED NOT TO HAVE FOUND DON FERNANDO THAN TO FIND HIM MARRIED FOR IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE DOOR WAS NOT YET ENTIRELY SHUT UPON RELIEF IN MY CASE AND I THOUGHT THAT PERHAPS HEAVEN HAD PUT THIS IMPEDIMENT IN THE WAY OF THE SECOND MARRIAGE
201-127786-0074 TO LEAD HIM TO RECOGNISE HIS OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FORMER ONE AND REFLECT THAT AS A CHRISTIAN HE WAS BOUND TO CONSIDER HIS SOUL ABOVE ALL HUMAN OBJECTS ALL THIS PASSED THROUGH MY MIND AND I STROVE TO COMFORT MYSELF WITHOUT COMFORT
201-127786-0075 INDULGING IN FAINT AND DISTANT HOPES OF CHERISHING THAT LIFE THAT I NOW ABHOR BUT WHILE I WAS IN THE CITY UNCERTAIN WHAT TO DO AS I COULD NOT FIND DON FERNANDO I HEARD NOTICE GIVEN BY THE PUBLIC CRIER OFFERING A GREAT REWARD TO ANYONE WHO SHOULD FIND ME
201-127786-0076 AND GIVING THE PARTICULARS OF MY AGE AND OF THE VERY DRESS I WORE AND I HEARD IT SAID THAT THE LAD WHO CAME WITH ME HAD TAKEN ME AWAY FROM MY FATHER'S HOUSE A THING THAT CUT ME TO THE HEART SHOWING HOW LOW MY GOOD NAME HAD FALLEN SINCE IT WAS NOT ENOUGH THAT I SHOULD LOSE IT BY MY FLIGHT
201-127786-0077 BUT THEY MUST ADD WITH WHOM I HAD FLED AND THAT ONE SO MUCH BENEATH ME AND SO UNWORTHY OF MY CONSIDERATION THE INSTANT I HEARD THE NOTICE I QUITTED THE CITY WITH MY SERVANT WHO NOW BEGAN TO SHOW SIGNS OF WAVERING IN HIS FIDELITY TO ME AND THE SAME NIGHT FOR FEAR OF DISCOVERY
201-127786-0078 HE LAID ASIDE THE ENTREATIES WHICH HE HAD EMPLOYED AT FIRST AND BEGAN TO USE VIOLENCE BUT JUST HEAVEN THAT SELDOM FAILS TO WATCH OVER AND AID GOOD INTENTIONS SO AIDED MINE THAT WITH MY SLIGHT STRENGTH AND WITH LITTLE EXERTION
201-127786-0079 I PUSHED HIM OVER A PRECIPICE WHERE I LEFT HIM WHETHER DEAD OR ALIVE I KNOW NOT AND THEN WITH GREATER SPEED THAN SEEMED POSSIBLE IN MY TERROR AND FATIGUE I MADE MY WAY INTO THE MOUNTAINS WITHOUT ANY OTHER THOUGHT OR PURPOSE SAVE THAT OF HIDING MYSELF AMONG THEM AND ESCAPING MY FATHER
201-127786-0080 AND THOSE DESPATCHED IN SEARCH OF ME BY HIS ORDERS IT IS NOW I KNOW NOT HOW MANY MONTHS SINCE WITH THIS OBJECT I CAME HERE WHERE I MET A HERDSMAN WHO ENGAGED ME AS HIS SERVANT AT A PLACE IN THE HEART OF THIS SIERRA
201-127786-0081 BUT ALL MY CARE AND PAINS WERE UNAVAILING FOR MY MASTER MADE THE DISCOVERY THAT I WAS NOT A MAN AND HARBOURED THE SAME BASE DESIGNS AS MY SERVANT
2092-145706-0000 KLETKE THERE WAS ONCE UPON A TIME A MAN AND WOMAN WHO HAD THREE FINE LOOKING SONS BUT THEY WERE SO POOR THAT THEY HAD HARDLY ENOUGH FOOD FOR THEMSELVES LET ALONE THEIR CHILDREN
2092-145706-0001 OF HER AND THEIR FATHER THE THREE SET FORTH ON THEIR TRAVELS THE YOUNGEST OF THE THREE BROTHERS WHOSE NAME WAS FERKO WAS A BEAUTIFUL YOUTH WITH A SPLENDID FIGURE BLUE EYES FAIR HAIR
2092-145706-0002 AND A COMPLEXION LIKE MILK AND ROSES HIS TWO BROTHERS WERE AS JEALOUS OF HIM AS THEY COULD BE FOR THEY THOUGHT THAT WITH HIS GOOD LOOKS HE WOULD BE SURE TO BE MORE FORTUNATE THAN THEY WOULD EVER BE
2092-145706-0003 FOR THE SUN WAS HOT AND THEY WERE TIRED OF WALKING FERKO FELL FAST ASLEEP BUT THE OTHER TWO REMAINED AWAKE AND THE ELDEST SAID TO THE SECOND BROTHER WHAT DO YOU SAY TO DOING OUR BROTHER FERKO SOME HARM
2092-145706-0004 HE IS SO BEAUTIFUL THAT EVERYONE TAKES A FANCY TO HIM WHICH IS MORE THAN THEY DO TO US IF WE COULD ONLY GET HIM OUT OF THE WAY WE MIGHT SUCCEED BETTER I QUITE AGREE WITH YOU ANSWERED THE SECOND BROTHER
2092-145706-0005 AND MY ADVICE IS TO EAT UP HIS LOAF OF BREAD AND THEN TO REFUSE TO GIVE HIM A BIT OF OURS UNTIL HE HAS PROMISED TO LET US PUT OUT HIS EYES OR BREAK HIS LEGS HIS ELDEST BROTHER WAS DELIGHTED WITH THIS PROPOSAL
2092-145706-0006 AND THE TWO WICKED WRETCHES SEIZED FERKO'S LOAF AND ATE IT ALL UP WHILE THE POOR BOY WAS STILL ASLEEP WHEN HE DID AWAKE HE FELT VERY HUNGRY AND TURNED TO EAT HIS BREAD BUT HIS BROTHERS CRIED OUT
2092-145706-0007 YOU ATE YOUR LOAF IN YOUR SLEEP YOU GLUTTON AND YOU MAY STARVE AS LONG AS YOU LIKE BUT YOU WON'T GET A SCRAP OF OURS FERKO WAS AT A LOSS TO UNDERSTAND HOW HE COULD HAVE EATEN IN HIS SLEEP BUT HE SAID NOTHING
2092-145706-0008 AND FASTED ALL THAT DAY AND THE NEXT NIGHT BUT ON THE FOLLOWING MORNING HE WAS SO HUNGRY THAT HE BURST INTO TEARS AND IMPLORED HIS BROTHERS TO GIVE HIM A LITTLE BIT OF THEIR BREAD
2092-145706-0009 AND BREAK ONE OF YOUR LEGS THEN WE WILL GIVE YOU A BIT OF OUR BREAD AT THESE WORDS POOR FERKO WEPT MORE BITTERLY THAN BEFORE AND BORE THE TORMENTS OF HUNGER TILL THE SUN WAS HIGH IN THE HEAVENS
2092-145706-0010 THEN HE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER AND HE CONSENTED TO ALLOW HIS LEFT EYE TO BE PUT OUT AND HIS LEFT LEG TO BE BROKEN WHEN THIS WAS DONE HE STRETCHED OUT HIS HAND EAGERLY FOR THE PIECE OF BREAD
2092-145706-0011 BUT HIS BROTHERS GAVE HIM SUCH A TINY SCRAP THAT THE STARVING YOUTH FINISHED IT IN A MOMENT AND BESOUGHT THEM FOR A SECOND BIT BUT THE MORE FERKO WEPT AND TOLD HIS BROTHERS THAT HE WAS DYING OF HUNGER
2092-145706-0012 THE MORE THEY LAUGHED AND SCOLDED HIM FOR HIS GREED SO HE ENDURED THE PANGS OF STARVATION ALL THAT DAY BUT WHEN NIGHT CAME HIS ENDURANCE GAVE WAY AND HE LET HIS RIGHT EYE BE PUT OUT
2092-145706-0013 AND HIS RIGHT LEG BROKEN FOR A SECOND PIECE OF BREAD AFTER HIS BROTHERS HAD THUS SUCCESSFULLY MAIMED AND DISFIGURED HIM FOR LIFE THEY LEFT HIM GROANING ON THE GROUND AND CONTINUED THEIR JOURNEY WITHOUT HIM
2092-145706-0014 POOR FERKO ATE UP THE SCRAP OF BREAD THEY HAD LEFT HIM AND WEPT BITTERLY BUT NO ONE HEARD HIM OR CAME TO HIS HELP NIGHT CAME ON AND THE POOR BLIND YOUTH HAD NO EYES TO CLOSE
2092-145706-0015 AND COULD ONLY CRAWL ALONG THE GROUND NOT KNOWING IN THE LEAST WHERE HE WAS GOING BUT WHEN THE SUN WAS ONCE MORE HIGH IN THE HEAVENS FERKO FELT THE BLAZING HEAT SCORCH HIM
2092-145706-0016 AND SOUGHT FOR SOME COOL SHADY PLACE TO REST HIS ACHING LIMBS HE CLIMBED TO THE TOP OF A HILL AND LAY DOWN IN THE GRASS AND AS HE THOUGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF A BIG TREE
2092-145706-0017 IS THERE ANYTHING THE LEAST WONDERFUL OR REMARKABLE ABOUT THIS NEIGHBOURHOOD I SHOULD JUST THINK THERE WAS REPLIED THE OTHER MANY THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD
2092-145706-0018 THERE IS A LAKE DOWN THERE BELOW US AND ANYONE WHO BATHES IN IT THOUGH HE WERE AT DEATH'S DOOR BECOMES SOUND AND WELL ON THE SPOT AND THOSE WHO WASH THEIR EYES WITH THE DEW ON THIS HILL
2092-145706-0019 BECOME AS SHARP SIGHTED AS THE EAGLE EVEN IF THEY HAVE BEEN BLIND FROM THEIR YOUTH WELL ANSWERED THE FIRST RAVEN MY EYES ARE IN NO WANT OF THIS HEALING BATH FOR HEAVEN BE PRAISED
2092-145706-0020 THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THEY WERE BUT MY WING HAS BEEN VERY FEEBLE AND WEAK EVER SINCE IT WAS SHOT BY AN ARROW MANY YEARS AGO SO LET US FLY AT ONCE TO THE LAKE THAT I MAY BE RESTORED TO HEALTH AND STRENGTH AGAIN
2092-145706-0021 AND SO THEY FLEW AWAY THEIR WORDS REJOICED FERKO'S HEART AND HE WAITED IMPATIENTLY TILL EVENING SHOULD COME AND HE COULD RUB THE PRECIOUS DEW ON HIS SIGHTLESS EYES
2092-145706-0022 AT LAST IT BEGAN TO GROW DUSK AND THE SUN SANK BEHIND THE MOUNTAINS GRADUALLY IT BECAME COOLER ON THE HILL AND THE GRASS GREW WET WITH DEW THEN FERKO BURIED HIS FACE IN THE GROUND
2092-145706-0023 TILL HIS EYES WERE DAMP WITH DEWDROPS AND IN A MOMENT HE SAW CLEARER THAN HE HAD EVER DONE IN HIS LIFE BEFORE THE MOON WAS SHINING BRIGHTLY AND LIGHTED HIM TO THE LAKE WHERE HE COULD BATHE HIS POOR BROKEN LEGS
2092-145706-0024 THEN FERKO CRAWLED TO THE EDGE OF THE LAKE AND DIPPED HIS LIMBS IN THE WATER NO SOONER HAD HE DONE SO
2092-145706-0025 HE HAD NOT GONE FAR BEFORE HE MET A WOLF WHO WAS LIMPING DISCONSOLATELY ALONG ON THREE LEGS AND WHO ON PERCEIVING FERKO BEGAN TO HOWL DISMALLY MY GOOD FRIEND SAID THE YOUTH
2092-145706-0026 BE OF GOOD CHEER FOR I CAN SOON HEAL YOUR LEG AND WITH THESE WORDS HE POURED SOME OF THE PRECIOUS WATER OVER THE WOLF'S PAW AND IN A MINUTE THE ANIMAL WAS SPRINGING ABOUT SOUND AND WELL ON ALL FOURS
2092-145706-0027 THE GRATEFUL CREATURE THANKED HIS BENEFACTOR WARMLY AND PROMISED FERKO TO DO HIM A GOOD TURN IF HE SHOULD EVER NEED IT FERKO CONTINUED HIS WAY TILL HE CAME TO A PLOUGHED FIELD
2092-145706-0028 HERE HE NOTICED A LITTLE MOUSE CREEPING WEARILY ALONG ON ITS HIND PAWS FOR ITS FRONT PAWS HAD BOTH BEEN BROKEN IN A TRAP FERKO FELT SO SORRY FOR THE LITTLE BEAST
2092-145706-0029 THAT HE SPOKE TO IT IN THE MOST FRIENDLY MANNER AND WASHED ITS SMALL PAWS WITH THE HEALING WATER IN A MOMENT THE MOUSE WAS SOUND AND WHOLE AND AFTER THANKING THE KIND PHYSICIAN IT SCAMPERED AWAY OVER THE PLOUGHED FURROWS
2092-145706-0030 FERKO AGAIN PROCEEDED ON HIS JOURNEY BUT HE HADN'T GONE FAR BEFORE A QUEEN BEE FLEW AGAINST HIM TRAILING ONE WING BEHIND HER WHICH HAD BEEN CRUELLY TORN IN TWO BY A BIG BIRD
2092-145706-0031 FERKO WAS NO LESS WILLING TO HELP HER THAN HE HAD BEEN TO HELP THE WOLF AND THE MOUSE SO HE POURED SOME HEALING DROPS OVER THE WOUNDED WING ON THE SPOT THE QUEEN BEE WAS CURED AND TURNING TO FERKO SHE SAID
2092-145706-0032 I AM MOST GRATEFUL FOR YOUR KINDNESS AND SHALL REWARD YOU SOME DAY AND WITH THESE WORDS SHE FLEW AWAY HUMMING GAILY THEN FERKO WANDERED ON FOR MANY A LONG DAY
2092-145706-0033 AND AT LENGTH REACHED A STRANGE KINGDOM HERE HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF HE MIGHT AS WELL GO STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND OFFER HIS SERVICES TO THE KING OF THE COUNTRY FOR HE HAD HEARD THAT THE KING'S DAUGHTER
2092-145706-0034 THEY HAD MANAGED TO OBTAIN PLACES IN THE KING'S SERVICE AND WHEN THEY RECOGNISED FERKO WITH HIS EYES AND LEGS SOUND AND WELL THEY WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH FOR THEY FEARED HE WOULD TELL THE KING OF THEIR CONDUCT
2092-145706-0035 FOR SHE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE SO HANDSOME IN HER LIFE BEFORE HIS BROTHERS NOTICED THIS AND ENVY AND JEALOUSY WERE ADDED TO THEIR FEAR SO MUCH SO THAT THEY DETERMINED ONCE MORE TO DESTROY HIM
2092-145706-0036 THEY WENT TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THAT FERKO WAS A WICKED MAGICIAN WHO HAD COME TO THE PALACE WITH THE INTENTION OF CARRYING OFF THE PRINCESS THEN THE KING HAD FERKO BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND SAID
2092-145706-0037 YOU ARE ACCUSED OF BEING A MAGICIAN WHO WISHES TO ROB ME OF MY DAUGHTER AND I CONDEMN YOU TO DEATH BUT IF YOU CAN FULFIL THREE TASKS WHICH I SHALL SET YOU TO DO YOUR LIFE SHALL BE SPARED
2092-145706-0038 ON CONDITION YOU LEAVE THE COUNTRY BUT IF YOU CANNOT PERFORM WHAT I DEMAND YOU SHALL BE HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE AND TURNING TO THE TWO WICKED BROTHERS HE SAID SUGGEST SOMETHING FOR HIM TO DO
2092-145706-0039 NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT HE MUST SUCCEED IN IT OR DIE THEY DID NOT THINK LONG BUT REPLIED LET HIM BUILD YOUR MAJESTY IN ONE DAY A MORE BEAUTIFUL PALACE THAN THIS AND IF HE FAILS IN THE ATTEMPT
2092-145706-0040 LET HIM BE HUNG THE KING WAS PLEASED WITH THIS PROPOSAL AND COMMANDED FERKO TO SET TO WORK ON THE FOLLOWING DAY THE TWO BROTHERS WERE DELIGHTED FOR THEY THOUGHT THEY HAD NOW GOT RID OF FERKO FOR EVER
2092-145706-0041 AS HE WAS WANDERING DISCONSOLATELY ABOUT THE MEADOWS ROUND THE PALACE WONDERING HOW HE COULD ESCAPE BEING PUT TO DEATH A LITTLE BEE FLEW PAST AND SETTLING ON HIS SHOULDER WHISPERED IN HIS EAR
2092-145706-0042 WHAT IS TROUBLING YOU MY KIND BENEFACTOR CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU I AM THE BEE WHOSE WING YOU HEALED
2092-145706-0043 A PALACE SHALL BE BUILT UNLIKE ANY THAT KING HAS DWELT IN BEFORE JUST STAY HERE TILL I COME AGAIN AND TELL YOU THAT IT IS FINISHED HAVING SAID THIS SHE FLEW MERRILY AWAY AND FERKO
2092-145706-0044 BE OF GOOD CHEER AND LEAD THE KING TO THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE CITY WALLS AND HUMMING GAILY SHE FLEW AWAY AGAIN FERKO WENT AT ONCE TO THE KING AND TOLD HIM THE PALACE WAS FINISHED
2092-145706-0045 THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER AND THEIR ASTONISHMENT WAS GREAT AT THE SIGHT WHICH MET THEIR EYES A SPLENDID PALACE REARED ITSELF ON THE HILL JUST OUTSIDE THE WALLS OF THE CITY MADE OF THE MOST EXQUISITE FLOWERS
2092-145706-0046 WITH SUNFLOWERS FOR KNOCKERS AND ALL ROUND HYACINTHS AND OTHER SWEET SMELLING FLOWERS BLOOMED IN MASSES SO THAT THE AIR WAS PERFUMED FAR AND NEAR AND ENCHANTED ALL WHO WERE PRESENT
2092-145706-0047 THIS SPLENDID PALACE HAD BEEN BUILT BY THE GRATEFUL QUEEN BEE WHO HAD SUMMONED ALL THE OTHER BEES IN THE KINGDOM TO HELP HER THE KING'S AMAZEMENT KNEW NO BOUNDS AND THE PRINCESS'S EYES BEAMED WITH DELIGHT
2092-145706-0048 ON THE DELIGHTED FERKO BUT THE TWO BROTHERS HAD GROWN QUITE GREEN WITH ENVY AND ONLY DECLARED THE MORE THAT FERKO WAS NOTHING BUT A WICKED MAGICIAN
2092-145706-0049 THE KING ALTHOUGH HE HAD BEEN SURPRISED AND ASTONISHED AT THE WAY HIS COMMANDS HAD BEEN CARRIED OUT WAS VERY VEXED
2092-145706-0050 AND TURNING TO THE TWO BROTHERS HE SAID HE HAS CERTAINLY ACCOMPLISHED THE FIRST TASK WITH THE AID NO DOUBT OF HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC BUT WHAT SHALL WE GIVE HIM TO DO NOW
2092-145706-0051 LET US MAKE IT AS DIFFICULT AS POSSIBLE AND IF HE FAILS HE SHALL DIE THEN THE ELDEST BROTHER REPLIED THE CORN HAS ALL BEEN CUT BUT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN PUT INTO BARNS
2092-145706-0052 LET THE KNAVE COLLECT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM INTO ONE BIG HEAP BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS LEFT LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH
2092-145706-0053 THE PRINCESS GREW WHITE WITH TERROR WHEN SHE HEARD THESE WORDS BUT FERKO FELT MUCH MORE CHEERFUL THAN HE HAD DONE THE FIRST TIME AND WANDERED OUT INTO THE MEADOWS AGAIN
2092-145706-0054 BUT HE COULD THINK OF NO WAY OF ESCAPE THE SUN SANK TO REST AND NIGHT CAME ON WHEN A LITTLE MOUSE STARTED OUT OF THE GRASS AT FERKO'S FEET AND SAID TO HIM I'M DELIGHTED TO SEE YOU
2092-145706-0055 MY KIND BENEFACTOR BUT WHY ARE YOU LOOKING SO SAD CAN I BE OF ANY HELP TO YOU AND THUS REPAY YOUR GREAT KINDNESS TO ME THEN FERKO RECOGNISED THE MOUSE WHOSE FRONT PAWS HE HAD HEALED AND REPLIED
2092-145706-0056 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM HAS TO BE GATHERED INTO ONE BIG HEAP AND IF AS MUCH AS A STALK OF CORN IS WANTING I MUST PAY FOR IT WITH MY LIFE IS THAT ALL ANSWERED THE MOUSE
2092-145706-0057 THAT NEEDN'T DISTRESS YOU MUCH JUST TRUST IN ME AND BEFORE THE SUN SETS AGAIN YOU SHALL HEAR THAT YOUR TASK IS DONE AND WITH THESE WORDS THE LITTLE CREATURE SCAMPERED AWAY INTO THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0058 FERKO WHO NEVER DOUBTED THAT THE MOUSE WOULD BE AS GOOD AS ITS WORD LAY DOWN COMFORTED ON THE SOFT GRASS AND SLEPT SOUNDLY TILL NEXT MORNING THE DAY PASSED SLOWLY
2092-145706-0059 AND THE WHOLE COURT WENT OUT TO SEE THE WONDER
2092-145706-0060 FOR IN A HEAP HIGHER THAN THE KING'S PALACE LAY ALL THE GRAIN OF THE COUNTRY AND NOT A SINGLE STALK OF CORN HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND IN ANY OF THE FIELDS AND HOW HAD ALL THIS BEEN DONE
2092-145706-0061 THE LITTLE MOUSE HAD SUMMONED EVERY OTHER MOUSE IN THE LAND TO ITS HELP AND TOGETHER THEY HAD COLLECTED ALL THE GRAIN IN THE KINGDOM THE KING COULD NOT HIDE HIS AMAZEMENT BUT AT THE SAME TIME HIS WRATH INCREASED
2092-145706-0062 AND HE WAS MORE READY THAN EVER TO BELIEVE THE TWO BROTHERS WHO KEPT ON REPEATING
2092-145706-0063 THAN A WICKED MAGICIAN ONLY THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS REJOICED OVER FERKO'S SUCCESS AND LOOKED ON HIM WITH FRIENDLY GLANCES WHICH THE YOUTH RETURNED THE MORE THE CRUEL KING GAZED ON THE WONDER BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0064 THE MORE ANGRY HE BECAME FOR HE COULD NOT IN THE FACE OF HIS PROMISE PUT THE STRANGER TO DEATH HE TURNED ONCE MORE TO THE TWO BROTHERS AND SAID HIS DIABOLICAL MAGIC HAS HELPED HIM AGAIN
2092-145706-0065 BUT NOW WHAT THIRD TASK SHALL WE SET HIM TO DO NO MATTER HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HE MUST DO IT OR DIE THE ELDEST ANSWERED QUICKLY LET HIM DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THIS HILL
2092-145706-0066 BEFORE TO MORROW NIGHT IF HE DOES THIS HE MAY GO FREE IF NOT HE SHALL BE HUNG AS YOU HAVE SAID AT THESE WORDS THE PRINCESS BURST INTO TEARS
2092-145706-0067 AND WHEN THE KING SAW THIS HE ORDERED HER TO BE SHUT UP IN A HIGH TOWER AND CAREFULLY GUARDED TILL THE DANGEROUS MAGICIAN SHOULD EITHER HAVE LEFT THE KINGDOM OR BEEN HUNG ON THE NEAREST TREE FERKO WANDERED OUT INTO THE FIELDS AGAIN
2092-145706-0068 AND SAT DOWN ON THE STUMP OF A TREE WONDERING WHAT HE SHOULD DO NEXT SUDDENLY A BIG WOLF RAN UP TO HIM AND STANDING STILL SAID I'M VERY GLAD TO SEE YOU AGAIN MY KIND BENEFACTOR
2092-145706-0069 WHAT ARE YOU THINKING ABOUT ALL ALONE BY YOURSELF IF I CAN HELP YOU IN ANY WAY ONLY SAY THE WORD FOR I WOULD LIKE TO GIVE YOU A PROOF OF MY GRATITUDE FERKO AT ONCE RECOGNISED THE WOLF
2092-145706-0070 WHOSE BROKEN LEG HE HAD HEALED AND TOLD HIM WHAT HE HAD TO DO THE FOLLOWING DAY IF HE WISHED TO ESCAPE WITH HIS LIFE BUT HOW IN THE WORLD HE ADDED AM I TO COLLECT ALL THE WOLVES OF THE KINGDOM ON TO THAT HILL OVER THERE
2092-145706-0071 IF THAT'S ALL YOU WANT DONE ANSWERED THE WOLF YOU NEEDN'T WORRY YOURSELF I'LL UNDERTAKE THE TASK AND YOU'LL HEAR FROM ME AGAIN BEFORE SUNSET TO MORROW
2092-145706-0072 AND WITH THESE WORDS HE TROTTED QUICKLY AWAY THEN THE YOUTH REJOICED GREATLY FOR NOW HE FELT THAT HIS LIFE WAS SAFE BUT HE GREW VERY SAD WHEN HE THOUGHT OF THE BEAUTIFUL PRINCESS
2092-145706-0073 AND THAT HE WOULD NEVER SEE HER AGAIN IF HE LEFT THE COUNTRY HE LAY DOWN ONCE MORE ON THE GRASS AND SOON FELL FAST ASLEEP ALL THE NEXT DAY HE SPENT WANDERING ABOUT THE FIELDS
2092-145706-0074 THEN RETURN AT ONCE TO ME AND GET ON MY BACK AND I WILL HELP YOU TO DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES TOGETHER THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND TOLD THE KING THAT HE WAS READY TO PERFORM THE THIRD TASK IF HE WOULD COME TO THE HILL AND SEE IT DONE
2092-145706-0075 FERKO HIMSELF RETURNED TO THE FIELDS AND MOUNTING ON THE WOLF'S BACK HE RODE TO THE WOOD CLOSE BY QUICK AS LIGHTNING THE WOLF FLEW ROUND THE WOOD AND IN A MINUTE MANY HUNDRED WOLVES ROSE UP BEFORE HIM
2092-145706-0076 INCREASING IN NUMBER EVERY MOMENT TILL THEY COULD BE COUNTED BY THOUSANDS HE DROVE THEM ALL BEFORE HIM ON TO THE HILL WHERE THE KING AND HIS WHOLE COURT AND FERKO'S TWO BROTHERS WERE STANDING ONLY THE LOVELY PRINCESS WAS NOT PRESENT
2092-145706-0077 FOR SHE WAS SHUT UP IN HER TOWER WEEPING BITTERLY THE WICKED BROTHERS STAMPED AND FOAMED WITH RAGE WHEN THEY SAW THE FAILURE OF THEIR WICKED DESIGNS BUT THE KING WAS OVERCOME BY A SUDDEN TERROR
2092-145706-0078 WHEN HE SAW THE ENORMOUS PACK OF WOLVES APPROACHING NEARER AND NEARER AND CALLING OUT TO FERKO HE SAID ENOUGH ENOUGH WE DON'T WANT ANY MORE BUT THE WOLF ON WHOSE BACK FERKO SAT SAID TO ITS RIDER
2092-145706-0079 GO ON GO ON AND AT THE SAME MOMENT MANY MORE WOLVES RAN UP THE HILL HOWLING HORRIBLY AND SHOWING THEIR WHITE TEETH THE KING IN HIS TERROR CALLED OUT STOP A MOMENT I WILL GIVE YOU HALF MY KINGDOM
2092-145706-0080 IF YOU WILL DRIVE ALL THE WOLVES AWAY BUT FERKO PRETENDED NOT TO HEAR AND DROVE SOME MORE THOUSANDS BEFORE HIM SO THAT EVERYONE QUAKED WITH HORROR AND FEAR THEN THE KING RAISED HIS VOICE AGAIN AND CALLED OUT
2092-145706-0081 STOP YOU SHALL HAVE MY WHOLE KINGDOM IF YOU WILL ONLY DRIVE THESE WOLVES BACK TO THE PLACES THEY CAME FROM BUT THE WOLF KEPT ON ENCOURAGING FERKO AND SAID GO ON GO ON SO HE LED THE WOLVES ON
2092-145706-0082 TILL AT LAST THEY FELL ON THE KING AND ON THE WICKED BROTHERS AND ATE THEM AND THE WHOLE COURT UP IN A MOMENT THEN FERKO WENT STRAIGHT TO THE PALACE AND SET THE PRINCESS FREE AND ON THE SAME DAY
2092-145706-0083 HE MARRIED HER AND WAS CROWNED KING OF THE COUNTRY AND THE WOLVES ALL WENT PEACEFULLY BACK TO THEIR OWN HOMES AND FERKO AND HIS BRIDE LIVED FOR MANY YEARS IN PEACE AND HAPPINESS TOGETHER
2092-145709-0000 KLETKE ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WERE THREE PRINCESSES WHO WERE ALL THREE YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL BUT THE YOUNGEST ALTHOUGH SHE WAS NOT FAIRER THAN THE OTHER TWO WAS THE MOST LOVEABLE OF THEM ALL
2092-145709-0001 ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE PALACE IN WHICH THEY LIVED THERE STOOD A CASTLE WHICH WAS UNINHABITED AND ALMOST A RUIN BUT THE GARDEN WHICH SURROUNDED IT WAS A MASS OF BLOOMING FLOWERS
2092-145709-0002 AND IN THIS GARDEN THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS USED OFTEN TO WALK ONE DAY WHEN SHE WAS PACING TO AND FRO UNDER THE LIME TREES A BLACK CROW HOPPED OUT OF A ROSE BUSH IN FRONT OF HER
2092-145709-0003 THE POOR BEAST WAS ALL TORN AND BLEEDING AND THE KIND LITTLE PRINCESS WAS QUITE UNHAPPY ABOUT IT WHEN THE CROW SAW THIS IT TURNED TO HER AND SAID I AM NOT REALLY A BLACK CROW
2092-145709-0004 BUT AN ENCHANTED PRINCE WHO HAS BEEN DOOMED TO SPEND HIS YOUTH IN MISERY IF YOU ONLY LIKED PRINCESS YOU COULD SAVE ME BUT YOU WOULD HAVE TO SAY GOOD BYE TO ALL YOUR OWN PEOPLE
2092-145709-0005 AND COME AND BE MY CONSTANT COMPANION IN THIS RUINED CASTLE THERE IS ONE HABITABLE ROOM IN IT IN WHICH THERE IS A GOLDEN BED THERE YOU WILL HAVE TO LIVE ALL BY YOURSELF
2092-145709-0006 AND DON'T FORGET THAT WHATEVER YOU MAY SEE OR HEAR IN THE NIGHT YOU MUST NOT SCREAM OUT FOR IF YOU GIVE AS MUCH AS A SINGLE CRY MY SUFFERINGS WILL BE DOUBLED
2092-145709-0007 THE GOOD NATURED PRINCESS AT ONCE LEFT HER HOME AND HER FAMILY AND HURRIED TO THE RUINED CASTLE AND TOOK POSSESSION OF THE ROOM WITH THE GOLDEN BED
2092-145709-0008 WHEN NIGHT APPROACHED SHE LAY DOWN BUT THOUGH SHE SHUT HER EYES TIGHT SLEEP WOULD NOT COME AT MIDNIGHT SHE HEARD TO HER GREAT HORROR SOME ONE COMING ALONG THE PASSAGE AND IN A MINUTE
2092-145709-0009 HER DOOR WAS FLUNG WIDE OPEN AND A TROOP OF STRANGE BEINGS ENTERED THE ROOM THEY AT ONCE PROCEEDED TO LIGHT A FIRE IN THE HUGE FIREPLACE THEN THEY PLACED A GREAT CAULDRON OF BOILING WATER ON IT
2092-145709-0010 WHEN THEY HAD DONE THIS THEY APPROACHED THE BED ON WHICH THE TREMBLING GIRL LAY AND SCREAMING AND YELLING ALL THE TIME THEY DRAGGED HER TOWARDS THE CAULDRON SHE NEARLY DIED WITH FRIGHT
2092-145709-0011 BUT SHE NEVER UTTERED A SOUND THEN OF A SUDDEN THE COCK CREW AND ALL THE EVIL SPIRITS VANISHED AT THE SAME MOMENT THE CROW APPEARED AND HOPPED ALL ROUND THE ROOM WITH JOY
2092-145709-0012 IT THANKED THE PRINCESS MOST HEARTILY FOR HER GOODNESS AND SAID THAT ITS SUFFERINGS HAD ALREADY BEEN GREATLY LESSENED NOW ONE OF THE PRINCESS'S ELDER SISTERS WHO WAS VERY INQUISITIVE
2092-145709-0013 THAT AT LAST THE GOOD NATURED LITTLE PRINCESS CONSENTED BUT AT MIDNIGHT WHEN THE ODD FOLK APPEARED THE ELDER SISTER SCREAMED WITH TERROR AND FROM THIS TIME ON THE YOUNGEST PRINCESS
2092-145709-0014 INSISTED ALWAYS ON KEEPING WATCH ALONE SO SHE LIVED IN SOLITUDE ALL THE DAYTIME AND AT NIGHT SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN FRIGHTENED HAD SHE NOT BEEN SO BRAVE BUT EVERY DAY
2092-145709-0015 THE CROW CAME AND THANKED HER FOR HER ENDURANCE AND ASSURED HER THAT HIS SUFFERINGS WERE FAR LESS THAN THEY HAD BEEN AND SO TWO YEARS PASSED AWAY WHEN ONE DAY THE CROW CAME TO THE PRINCESS AND SAID
2092-145709-0016 IN ANOTHER YEAR I SHALL BE FREED FROM THE SPELL I AM UNDER AT PRESENT BECAUSE THEN THE SEVEN YEARS WILL BE OVER BUT BEFORE I CAN RESUME MY NATURAL FORM
2092-145709-0017 AND TAKE POSSESSION OF THE BELONGINGS OF MY FOREFATHERS YOU MUST GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TAKE SERVICE AS A MAIDSERVANT THE YOUNG PRINCESS CONSENTED AT ONCE AND FOR A WHOLE YEAR
2092-145709-0018 AND HAD WORKED HER LITTLE WHITE HANDS WEARY SHE HEARD A RUSTLING BESIDE HER AND A CRY OF JOY THEN SHE SAW A HANDSOME YOUTH STANDING BESIDE HER WHO KNELT DOWN AT HER FEET
2092-145709-0019 AND KISSED THE LITTLE WEARY WHITE HANDS I AM THE PRINCE HE SAID WHO YOU IN YOUR GOODNESS WHEN I WAS WANDERING ABOUT IN THE SHAPE OF A BLACK CROW FREED FROM THE MOST AWFUL TORMENTS
2092-145709-0020 COME NOW TO MY CASTLE WITH ME AND LET US LIVE THERE HAPPILY TOGETHER SO THEY WENT TO THE CASTLE WHERE THEY HAD BOTH ENDURED SO MUCH
2092-145709-0021 IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IT WAS THE SAME FOR IT HAD ALL BEEN REBUILT AND DONE UP AGAIN
211-122425-0000 DO YOU KNOW THAT HIS EMINENCE HAS BEEN MAKING FRESH COMPLAINTS AGAINST YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0001 AH THESE MUSKETEERS OF YOURS ARE VERY DEVILS FELLOWS TO BE HANGED NO SIRE REPLIED TREVILLE WHO SAW AT THE FIRST GLANCE HOW THINGS WOULD GO ON THE CONTRARY THEY ARE GOOD CREATURES AS MEEK AS LAMBS AND HAVE BUT ONE DESIRE
211-122425-0002 I'LL BE THEIR WARRANTY AND THAT IS THAT THEIR SWORDS MAY NEVER LEAVE THEIR SCABBARDS BUT IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SERVICE BUT WHAT ARE THEY TO DO
211-122425-0003 WOULD NOT ONE SAY HE WAS SPEAKING OF A RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY IN TRUTH MY DEAR CAPTAIN
211-122425-0004 AND BY AND BY BY AND BY WE WILL SEE AH SIRE IT IS BECAUSE I CONFIDE IN THAT JUSTICE THAT I SHALL WAIT PATIENTLY AND QUIETLY THE GOOD PLEASURE OF YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0005 THE KING THEREFORE AROSE A MINUTE AFTER AND PUTTING THE MONEY WHICH LAY BEFORE HIM INTO HIS POCKET
211-122425-0006 LA VIEUVILLE SAID HE TAKE MY PLACE
211-122425-0007 AH I HAD EIGHTY LOUIS BEFORE ME PUT DOWN THE SAME SUM SO THAT THEY WHO HAVE LOST MAY HAVE NOTHING TO COMPLAIN OF JUSTICE BEFORE EVERYTHING
211-122425-0008 YES SIRE AS THEY ALWAYS DO AND HOW DID THE THING HAPPEN LET US SEE FOR YOU KNOW MY DEAR CAPTAIN A JUDGE MUST HEAR BOTH SIDES GOOD LORD IN THE MOST SIMPLE AND NATURAL MANNER POSSIBLE
211-122425-0009 AND WHO HAVE I DARE AFFIRM TO THE KING HIS SERVICE MUCH AT HEART THREE OF MY BEST SOLDIERS I SAY
211-122425-0010 HAD MADE A PARTY OF PLEASURE WITH A YOUNG FELLOW FROM GASCONY WHOM I HAD INTRODUCED TO THEM THE SAME MORNING THE PARTY WAS TO TAKE PLACE AT SAINT GERMAIN I BELIEVE AND THEY HAD APPOINTED TO MEET AT THE CARMES DESCHAUX WHEN THEY WERE DISTURBED BY DE JUSSAC CAHUSAC
211-122425-0011 WHO CERTAINLY DID NOT GO THERE IN SUCH A NUMEROUS COMPANY WITHOUT SOME ILL INTENTION AGAINST THE EDICTS AH AH YOU INCLINE ME TO THINK SO SAID THE KING THERE IS NO DOUBT THEY WENT THITHER TO FIGHT THEMSELVES I DO NOT ACCUSE THEM SIRE
211-122425-0012 BUT I LEAVE YOUR MAJESTY TO JUDGE WHAT FIVE ARMED MEN COULD POSSIBLY BE GOING TO DO IN SUCH A DESERTED PLACE AS THE NEIGHBORHOOD
211-122425-0013 THEN UPON SEEING MY MUSKETEERS THEY CHANGED THEIR MINDS AND FORGOT THEIR PRIVATE HATRED FOR PARTISAN HATRED FOR YOUR MAJESTY CANNOT BE IGNORANT THAT THE MUSKETEERS WHO BELONG TO THE KING AND NOBODY BUT THE KING
211-122425-0014 ARE THE NATURAL ENEMIES OF THE GUARDSMEN WHO BELONG TO THE CARDINAL YES TREVILLE YES SAID THE KING IN A MELANCHOLY TONE AND IT IS VERY SAD BELIEVE ME TO SEE THUS TWO PARTIES IN FRANCE TWO HEADS TO ROYALTY
211-122425-0015 BUT I WILL NOT SWEAR TO IT SIRE YOU KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO DISCOVER THE TRUTH AND UNLESS A MAN BE ENDOWED WITH THAT ADMIRABLE INSTINCT
211-122425-0016 YOU ARE RIGHT TREVILLE BUT THEY WERE NOT ALONE YOUR MUSKETEERS THEY HAD A YOUTH WITH THEM YES SIRE AND ONE WOUNDED MAN SO THAT THREE OF THE KING'S MUSKETEERS ONE OF WHOM WAS WOUNDED
211-122425-0017 AND A YOUTH NOT ONLY MAINTAINED THEIR GROUND AGAINST FIVE OF THE MOST TERRIBLE OF THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN BUT ABSOLUTELY BROUGHT FOUR OF THEM TO EARTH WHY THIS IS A VICTORY CRIED THE KING ALL RADIANT A COMPLETE VICTORY
211-122425-0018 ONE HARDLY A YOUNG MAN BUT WHO HOWEVER BEHAVED HIMSELF SO ADMIRABLY ON THIS OCCASION THAT I WILL TAKE THE LIBERTY OF RECOMMENDING HIM TO YOUR MAJESTY HOW DOES HE CALL HIMSELF D'ARTAGNAN SIRE
211-122425-0019 HE IS THE SON OF ONE OF MY OLDEST FRIENDS THE SON OF A MAN WHO SERVED UNDER THE KING YOUR FATHER OF GLORIOUS MEMORY IN THE CIVIL WAR AND YOU SAY THIS YOUNG MAN BEHAVED HIMSELF WELL TELL ME HOW TREVILLE YOU KNOW HOW I DELIGHT IN ACCOUNTS OF WAR AND FIGHTING
211-122425-0020 PLACING HIS HAND UPON HIS HIP SIRE RESUMED TREVILLE AS I TOLD YOU
211-122425-0021 HE WAS DRESSED AS A CITIZEN THE GUARDS OF THE CARDINAL PERCEIVING HIS YOUTH AND THAT HE DID NOT BELONG TO THE CORPS INVITED HIM TO RETIRE BEFORE THEY ATTACKED SO YOU MAY PLAINLY SEE TREVILLE INTERRUPTED THE KING IT WAS THEY WHO ATTACKED
211-122425-0022 THAT IS TRUE SIRE THERE CAN BE NO MORE DOUBT ON THAT HEAD THEY CALLED UPON HIM THEN TO RETIRE BUT HE ANSWERED THAT HE WAS A MUSKETEER AT HEART ENTIRELY DEVOTED TO YOUR MAJESTY
211-122425-0023 BRAVE YOUNG MAN MURMURED THE KING WELL HE DID REMAIN WITH THEM AND YOUR MAJESTY HAS IN HIM SO FIRM A CHAMPION THAT IT WAS HE WHO GAVE JUSSAC THE TERRIBLE SWORD THRUST WHICH HAS MADE THE CARDINAL SO ANGRY
211-122425-0024 HE WHO WOUNDED JUSSAC CRIED THE KING HE A BOY
211-122425-0025 IT IS AS I HAVE THE HONOR TO RELATE IT TO YOUR MAJESTY JUSSAC ONE OF THE FIRST SWORDSMEN IN THE KINGDOM WELL SIRE FOR ONCE HE FOUND HIS MASTER I WILL SEE THIS YOUNG MAN TREVILLE I WILL SEE HIM AND IF ANYTHING CAN BE DONE
211-122425-0026 IT IS USELESS TO LET THE CARDINAL KNOW YES SIRE YOU UNDERSTAND TREVILLE AN EDICT IS STILL AN EDICT IT IS FORBIDDEN TO FIGHT AFTER ALL BUT THIS ENCOUNTER SIRE IS QUITE OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDITIONS OF A DUEL IT IS A BRAWL
211-122425-0027 THAT IS TRUE SAID THE KING BUT NEVER MIND TREVILLE COME STILL BY THE BACK STAIRCASE TREVILLE SMILED BUT AS IT WAS INDEED SOMETHING TO HAVE PREVAILED UPON THIS CHILD TO REBEL AGAINST HIS MASTER
211-122425-0028 HE SALUTED THE KING RESPECTFULLY AND WITH THIS AGREEMENT TOOK LEAVE OF HIM THAT EVENING THE THREE MUSKETEERS WERE INFORMED OF THE HONOR ACCORDED THEM AS THEY HAD LONG BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE KING THEY WERE NOT MUCH EXCITED
211-122425-0029 BUT D'ARTAGNAN WITH HIS GASCON IMAGINATION SAW IN IT HIS FUTURE FORTUNE AND PASSED THE NIGHT IN GOLDEN DREAMS
211-122425-0030 D'ARTAGNAN FOUND THE MUSKETEER DRESSED AND READY TO GO OUT AS THE HOUR TO WAIT UPON THE KING WAS NOT TILL TWELVE HE HAD MADE A PARTY WITH PORTHOS AND ARAMIS TO PLAY A GAME AT TENNIS
211-122425-0031 AND ALTHOUGH IGNORANT OF THE GAME WHICH HE HAD NEVER PLAYED HE ACCEPTED NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO WITH HIS TIME FROM NINE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AS IT THEN SCARCELY WAS TILL TWELVE THE TWO MUSKETEERS WERE ALREADY THERE AND WERE PLAYING TOGETHER
211-122425-0032 ALTHOUGH HE PLAYED WITH HIS LEFT HAND HE FOUND THAT HIS WOUND WAS YET TOO RECENT TO ALLOW OF SUCH EXERTION
211-122425-0033 AND AS HE DECLARED HE WAS TOO IGNORANT OF THE GAME TO PLAY IT REGULARLY THEY ONLY CONTINUED GIVING BALLS TO ONE ANOTHER WITHOUT COUNTING
211-122425-0034 PASSED SO CLOSE TO D'ARTAGNAN'S FACE
211-122425-0035 HIS AUDIENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN PROBABLY LOST AS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO PRESENT HIMSELF BEFORE THE KING NOW AS UPON THIS AUDIENCE IN HIS GASCON IMAGINATION DEPENDED HIS FUTURE LIFE HE SALUTED ARAMIS AND PORTHOS POLITELY
211-122425-0036 DECLARING THAT HE WOULD NOT RESUME THE GAME UNTIL HE SHOULD BE PREPARED TO PLAY WITH THEM ON MORE EQUAL TERMS
211-122425-0037 LOOK AT ME AS LONG AS YOU LIKE MY LITTLE GENTLEMAN I HAVE SAID WHAT I HAVE SAID
211-122425-0038 YOU'RE IN THE WRONG THERE FOR IF YOU KNEW MY NAME PERHAPS YOU WOULD NOT BE SO PRESSING WHAT IS YOUR NAME
211-122425-0039 LEST IT BE OBSERVED THAT WE GO OUT TOGETHER YOU MUST BE AWARE THAT FOR OUR UNDERTAKING COMPANY WOULD BE IN THE WAY THAT'S TRUE SAID THE GUARDSMAN ASTONISHED THAT HIS NAME HAD NOT PRODUCED MORE EFFECT UPON THE YOUNG MAN
211-122425-0040 THAT THEY DID NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THEIR YOUNG COMPANION GO OUT WHO AS HE HAD TOLD THE GUARDSMAN OF HIS EMINENCE STOPPED OUTSIDE THE DOOR AN INSTANT AFTER THE GUARDSMAN DESCENDED IN HIS TURN
211-122425-0041 WHICH WAS FIXED FOR MIDDAY HE CAST HIS EYES AROUND AND SEEING THAT THE STREET WAS EMPTY SAID TO HIS ADVERSARY MY FAITH IT IS FORTUNATE FOR YOU ALTHOUGH YOUR NAME IS BERNAJOUX TO HAVE ONLY TO DEAL WITH AN APPRENTICE MUSKETEER
211-122425-0042 NEVER MIND BE CONTENT I WILL DO MY BEST ON GUARD BUT SAID HE WHOM D'ARTAGNAN THUS PROVOKED IT APPEARS TO ME THAT THIS PLACE IS BADLY CHOSEN AND THAT WE SHOULD BE BETTER
211-122425-0043 BERNAJOUX WAS NOT A MAN TO HAVE SUCH A COMPLIMENT PAID TO HIM TWICE IN AN INSTANT HIS SWORD GLITTERED IN HIS HAND AND HE SPRANG UPON HIS ADVERSARY WHOM
211-122425-0044 HE HOPED TO INTIMIDATE BUT D'ARTAGNAN HAD ON THE PRECEDING DAY SERVED HIS APPRENTICESHIP FRESH SHARPENED BY HIS VICTORY FULL OF HOPES OF FUTURE FAVOR HE WAS RESOLVED NOT TO RECOIL A STEP SO THE TWO SWORDS WERE CROSSED CLOSE TO THE HILTS
211-122425-0045 AND AS D'ARTAGNAN STOOD FIRM IT WAS HIS ADVERSARY WHO MADE THE RETREATING STEP BUT D'ARTAGNAN SEIZED THE MOMENT AT WHICH IN THIS MOVEMENT THE SWORD OF BERNAJOUX DEVIATED FROM THE LINE HE FREED HIS WEAPON MADE A LUNGE AND TOUCHED HIS ADVERSARY ON THE SHOULDER
211-122425-0046 IN WHOSE SERVICE HE HAD A RELATIVE
211-122425-0047 AND PRESSING HIM WARMLY WITHOUT DOUBT WOULD SOON HAVE COMPLETED HIS WORK WITH A THIRD BLOW WHEN THE NOISE WHICH AROSE FROM THE STREET BEING HEARD IN THE TENNIS COURT TWO OF THE FRIENDS OF THE GUARDSMAN WHO HAD SEEN HIM GO OUT AFTER EXCHANGING SOME WORDS WITH D'ARTAGNAN RUSHED SWORD IN HAND FROM THE COURT AND FELL UPON THE CONQUEROR
211-122425-0048 AND THE MOMENT THE TWO GUARDSMEN ATTACKED THEIR YOUNG COMPANION DROVE THEM BACK BERNAJOUX NOW FELL AND AS THE GUARDSMEN WERE ONLY TWO AGAINST FOUR THEY BEGAN TO CRY TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0049 AT THESE CRIES ALL WHO WERE IN THE HOTEL RUSHED OUT AND FELL UPON THE FOUR COMPANIONS WHO ON THEIR SIDE CRIED ALOUD TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS THIS CRY WAS GENERALLY HEEDED
211-122425-0050 TO HIS EMINENCE THUS THE SOLDIERS OF OTHER COMPANIES THAN THOSE WHICH BELONGED TO THE RED DUKE AS ARAMIS HAD CALLED HIM OFTEN TOOK PART WITH THE KING'S MUSKETEERS IN THESE QUARRELS
211-122425-0051 TO THE RESCUE MUSKETEERS TO THE RESCUE
211-122425-0052 WHO HASTENED TO THE SUCCOR OF THEIR COMRADES THE MELEE BECAME GENERAL BUT STRENGTH WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0053 THE DOORS OF WHICH THEY CLOSED JUST IN TIME TO PREVENT THEIR ENEMIES FROM ENTERING WITH THEM AS TO THE WOUNDED MAN HE HAD BEEN TAKEN IN AT ONCE AND AS WE HAVE SAID IN A VERY BAD STATE
211-122425-0054 EXCITEMENT WAS AT ITS HEIGHT AMONG THE MUSKETEERS AND THEIR ALLIES AND THEY EVEN BEGAN TO DELIBERATE WHETHER THEY SHOULD NOT SET FIRE TO THE HOTEL
211-122425-0055 DOMESTICS IN DARING TO MAKE A SORTIE UPON THE KING'S MUSKETEERS THE PROPOSITION HAD BEEN MADE AND RECEIVED WITH ENTHUSIASM WHEN FORTUNATELY ELEVEN O'CLOCK STRUCK
211-122425-0056 THEY SUCCEEDED IN CALMING THEIR FRIENDS WHO CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH HURLING SOME PAVING STONES AGAINST THE GATES BUT THE GATES WERE TOO STRONG THEY SOON TIRED OF THE SPORT BESIDES THOSE WHO MUST BE CONSIDERED THE LEADERS OF THE ENTERPRISE HAD QUIT THE GROUP AND WERE MAKING THEIR WAY
211-122425-0057 WHO WAS WAITING FOR THEM ALREADY INFORMED OF THIS FRESH DISTURBANCE
211-122425-0058 AND LET US ENDEAVOR TO SEE THE KING BEFORE HE IS PREJUDICED BY THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0059 AND THE TWO WILL PASS OFF TOGETHER
211-122425-0060 DIRECTED HIS COURSE TOWARD THE LOUVRE BUT TO THE GREAT ASTONISHMENT OF THE CAPTAIN OF THE MUSKETEERS HE WAS INFORMED THAT THE KING HAD GONE STAG HUNTING IN THE FOREST OF SAINT GERMAIN
211-122425-0061 REQUIRED THIS INTELLIGENCE TO BE REPEATED TO HIM TWICE AND EACH TIME HIS COMPANIONS SAW HIS BROW BECOME DARKER HAD HIS MAJESTY ASKED HE ANY INTENTION OF HOLDING THIS HUNTING PARTY YESTERDAY NO YOUR EXCELLENCY
211-122425-0062 THE MASTER OF THE HOUNDS CAME THIS MORNING TO INFORM HIM THAT HE HAD MARKED DOWN A STAG AT FIRST THE KING ANSWERED THAT HE WOULD NOT GO BUT HE COULD NOT RESIST HIS LOVE OF SPORT AND SET OUT AFTER DINNER AND THE KING HAS SEEN THE CARDINAL
211-122425-0063 GENTLEMEN I WILL SEE THE KING THIS EVENING BUT AS TO YOU I DO NOT ADVISE YOU TO RISK DOING SO THIS ADVICE WAS TOO REASONABLE AND MOREOVER CAME FROM A MAN WHO KNEW THE KING TOO WELL TO ALLOW THE FOUR YOUNG MEN TO DISPUTE IT
211-122425-0064 EVERYONE TO RETURN HOME AND WAIT FOR NEWS
211-122425-0065 WITH A LETTER IN WHICH HE BEGGED OF HIM TO EJECT THE CARDINAL'S GUARDSMEN FROM HIS HOUSE AND TO REPRIMAND HIS PEOPLE FOR THEIR AUDACITY IN MAKING SORTIE AGAINST THE KING'S MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0066 WHOSE RELATIVE AS WE ALREADY KNOW BERNAJOUX WAS
211-122425-0067 BUT ON THE CONTRARY FOR HIM WHOSE PEOPLE THE MUSKETEERS HAD ASSAULTED AND WHOSE HOTEL THEY HAD ENDEAVORED TO BURN NOW AS THE DEBATE BETWEEN THESE TWO NOBLES MIGHT LAST A LONG TIME EACH BECOMING NATURALLY MORE FIRM IN HIS OWN OPINION
211-122425-0068 HE REPAIRED THEREFORE IMMEDIATELY TO HIS HOTEL AND CAUSED HIMSELF TO BE ANNOUNCED THE TWO NOBLES SALUTED EACH OTHER POLITELY FOR IF NO FRIENDSHIP EXISTED BETWEEN THEM THERE WAS AT LEAST ESTEEM BOTH WERE MEN OF COURAGE AND HONOR
211-122425-0069 WE FANCY THAT WE HAVE EACH CAUSE TO COMPLAIN OF THE OTHER AND I AM COME TO ENDEAVOR TO CLEAR UP THIS AFFAIR
211-122425-0070 AND ALL THE FAULT IS WITH YOUR MUSKETEERS
211-122425-0071 NOT TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSAL I AM ABOUT TO MAKE TO YOU
211-122425-0072 IN ADDITION TO THE SWORD THRUST IN HIS ARM WHICH IS NOT DANGEROUS
211-122425-0073 OF WHICH THE DOCTOR SAYS BAD THINGS
211-122425-0074 PERFECTLY DOES HE TALK WITH DIFFICULTY BUT HE CAN SPEAK
211-122425-0075 LET US ADJURE HIM IN THE NAME OF THE GOD BEFORE WHOM HE MUST PERHAPS APPEAR TO SPEAK THE TRUTH
211-122425-0076 THEN AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO SUGGEST A MORE REASONABLE PROPOSAL HE AGREED TO IT BOTH DESCENDED TO THE CHAMBER IN WHICH THE WOUNDED MAN LAY THE LATTER ON SEEING THESE TWO NOBLE LORDS WHO CAME TO VISIT HIM ENDEAVORED TO RAISE HIMSELF UP IN HIS BED
211-122425-0077 PLACED BETWEEN LIFE AND DEATH AS BERNAJOUX WAS HE HAD NO IDEA FOR A MOMENT OF CONCEALING THE TRUTH AND HE DESCRIBED TO THE TWO NOBLES THE AFFAIR EXACTLY AS IT HAD PASSED
211-122425-0078 RETURNED TO HIS HOTEL AND IMMEDIATELY SENT WORD TO THE FOUR FRIENDS THAT HE AWAITED THEIR COMPANY AT DINNER
211-122425-0079 THAT HIS EMINENCE'S GUARDSMEN HAD RECEIVED
211-122425-0080 NOT ONLY AS GOOD COMRADES BUT AS MEN WHO HAD SO OFTEN HAD THEIR TURN THAT THEY COULD VERY WELL AFFORD HIM HIS
211-122425-0081 HIS EYES THEREFORE WERE FIXED IN A SORT OF AGONY UPON THE DOOR THROUGH WHICH THE KING MUST ENTER
211-122442-0000 HE FOUND THE DOOR OF HIS PASSAGE OPEN SPRANG UP THE STAIRS AND KNOCKED SOFTLY IN A MANNER AGREED UPON BETWEEN HIM AND HIS LACKEY
211-122442-0001 WHOM HE HAD SENT HOME TWO HOURS BEFORE FROM THE HOTEL DE VILLE TELLING HIM TO SIT UP FOR HIM OPENED THE DOOR FOR HIM THE READER MAY ASK
211-122442-0002 WHEN HE WAS LEFT STIFF AS A RUSH IN LONDON IN THE INTERVENING TIME BUCKINGHAM PERHAPS SENT HIM TO PARIS AS HE DID THE HORSES HAS ANYONE BROUGHT A LETTER FOR ME ASKED D'ARTAGNAN EAGERLY
211-122442-0003 BUT ONE HAS COME OF ITSELF WHAT DO YOU MEAN BLOCKHEAD I MEAN TO SAY THAT WHEN I CAME IN ALTHOUGH I HAD THE KEY OF YOUR APARTMENT IN MY POCKET
211-122442-0004 I FOUND A LETTER ON THE GREEN TABLE COVER IN YOUR BEDROOM AND WHERE IS THAT LETTER
211-122442-0005 IT IS NOT NATURAL FOR LETTERS TO ENTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES IN THIS MANNER IF THE WINDOW HAD BEEN OPEN OR EVEN AJAR I SHOULD THINK NOTHING OF IT BUT NO ALL WAS HERMETICALLY SEALED
211-122442-0006 THERE IS CERTAINLY SOME MAGIC UNDERNEATH MEANWHILE THE YOUNG MAN HAD DARTED IN TO HIS CHAMBER AND OPENED THE LETTER
211-122442-0007 THERE ARE MANY THANKS TO BE OFFERED TO YOU AND TO BE TRANSMITTED TO YOU BE THIS EVENING ABOUT TEN O'CLOCK AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0008 WHILE READING THIS LETTER D'ARTAGNAN FELT HIS HEART DILATED AND COMPRESSED BY THAT DELICIOUS SPASM WHICH TORTURES AND CARESSES THE HEARTS OF LOVERS IT WAS THE FIRST BILLET HE HAD RECEIVED IT WAS THE FIRST RENDEZVOUS THAT HAD BEEN GRANTED HIM
211-122442-0009 HIS HEART SWELLED BY THE INTOXICATION OF JOY FELT READY TO DISSOLVE AWAY AT THE VERY GATE OF THAT TERRESTRIAL PARADISE CALLED LOVE
211-122442-0010 DID I NOT GUESS TRULY IS IT NOT SOME BAD AFFAIR
211-122442-0011 EXACTLY BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT LETTERS WHICH COME IN THIS WAY INTO SHUT UP HOUSES FALL FROM HEAVEN MY FRIEND FALL FROM HEAVEN
211-122442-0012 MY DEAR PLANCHET I AM THE HAPPIEST OF MEN
211-122442-0013 WHICH THE LIBERALITY OF D'ARTAGNAN HAD NOT ENTIRELY EFFACED LEFT ALONE D'ARTAGNAN READ AND REREAD HIS BILLET THEN HE KISSED AND REKISSED TWENTY TIMES THE LINES TRACED BY THE HAND OF HIS BEAUTIFUL MISTRESS
211-122442-0014 AT LENGTH HE WENT TO BED FELL ASLEEP AND HAD GOLDEN DREAMS

211-122442-0021 D'ARTAGNAN'S INTENTION WAS TO GO OUT WITHOUT SPEAKING TO THE WORTHY MERCER BUT THE LATTER MADE SO POLITE AND FRIENDLY A SALUTATION THAT HIS TENANT FELT OBLIGED NOT ONLY TO STOP BUT TO ENTER INTO CONVERSATION WITH HIM
211-122442-0022 BESIDES HOW IS IT POSSIBLE TO AVOID A LITTLE CONDESCENSION TOWARD A HUSBAND WHOSE PRETTY WIFE HAS APPOINTED A MEETING WITH YOU THAT SAME EVENING AT SAINT CLOUD
211-122442-0023 THE CONVERSATION NATURALLY FELL UPON THE INCARCERATION OF THE POOR MAN
211-122442-0024 WHOM HE NEVER CEASED TO DESIGNATE DURING HIS ACCOUNT BY THE TITLE OF THE CARDINAL'S EXECUTIONER AND EXPATIATED AT GREAT LENGTH UPON THE BASTILLE THE BOLTS THE WICKETS THE DUNGEONS THE GRATINGS THE INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE
211-122442-0025 D'ARTAGNAN LISTENED TO HIM WITH EXEMPLARY COMPLAISANCE AND WHEN HE HAD FINISHED SAID AND MADAME BONACIEUX DO YOU KNOW WHO CARRIED HER OFF FOR I DO NOT FORGET THAT I OWE TO THAT UNPLEASANT CIRCUMSTANCE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF HAVING MADE YOUR ACQUAINTANCE

211-122442-0041 HE HAD RETIRED AT ONE O'CLOCK UNDER THE PRETENSE OF BEING INDISPOSED AS TO THEIR MAJESTIES THEY DID NOT RETURN TO THE LOUVRE TILL SIX O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING NOW SAID TREVILLE LOWERING HIS VOICE AND LOOKING INTO EVERY CORNER OF THE APARTMENT TO SEE IF THEY WERE ALONE

211-122442-0044 THE CARDINAL IS NOT THE MAN TO FORGET A MYSTIFICATION UNTIL HE HAS SETTLED ACCOUNT WITH THE MYSTIFIER AND THE MYSTIFIER APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE THE AIR OF BEING A CERTAIN YOUNG GASCON OF MY ACQUAINTANCE DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THE CARDINAL IS AS WELL POSTED AS YOURSELF

211-122442-0078 HOW GLAD I AM TO SEE YOU WHY SO PLANCHET ASKED THE YOUNG MAN
211-122442-0079 BUT WHY THIS QUESTION BECAUSE WHILE YOU WERE TALKING WITH HIM I WATCHED YOU WITHOUT LISTENING TO YOU
211-122442-0080 TWO OR THREE TIMES BAH PREOCCUPIED AS MONSIEUR WAS WITH THE LETTER HE HAD RECEIVED HE DID NOT OBSERVE THAT BUT I WHOM THE STRANGE FASHION IN WHICH THAT LETTER CAME INTO THE HOUSE HAD PLACED ON MY GUARD I DID NOT LOSE A MOVEMENT OF HIS FEATURES
211-122442-0081 AND YOU FOUND IT TRAITOROUS MONSIEUR INDEED
211-122442-0082 SHUT HIS DOOR AND SET OFF AT A QUICK PACE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION
211-122442-0083 HEAVED A PROFOUND SIGH AND SET TO WORK TO GROOM THE THIRD HORSE
2136-5140-0000 AS ALREADY DETAILED THAT I WAS ONE NIGHT SITTING AT THE GREAT DRAWING ROOM WINDOW LOST IN THE MELANCHOLY REVERIES OF NIGHT AND IN ADMIRATION OF THE MOONLIGHTED SCENE I WAS THE ONLY OCCUPANT OF THE ROOM
2136-5140-0001 HARDLY REACHED TO THE WINDOW AT WHICH I SAT THE SHORN GRASS SLOPED GENTLY DOWNWARD FROM THE WINDOWS TILL IT MET THE BROAD LEVEL ON WHICH STOOD IN CLUMPS OR SOLITARILY SCATTERED SOME OF THE NOBLEST TIMBER IN ENGLAND
2136-5140-0002 HOAR IN THE MOONBEAMS STOOD THOSE GRACEFUL TREES CASTING THEIR MOVELESS SHADOWS UPON THE GRASS AND IN THE BACKGROUND CROWNING THE UNDULATIONS OF THE DISTANCE IN MASSES WERE PILED THOSE WOODS AMONG WHICH LAY THE SOLITARY TOMB
2136-5140-0003 TO ME FUNEREAL BUT GLORIOUS WOODS WHICH FORMED THE BACKGROUND OF THE PICTURE MY THOUGHTS RECURRED TO MY FATHER'S MYSTERIOUS INTIMATIONS AND THE IMAGE OF THE APPROACHING VISITOR AND THE THOUGHT OF THE UNKNOWN JOURNEY SADDENED ME
2136-5140-0004 IN ALL THAT CONCERNED HIS RELIGION FROM VERY EARLY ASSOCIATION THERE WAS TO ME SOMETHING OF THE UNEARTHLY AND SPECTRAL WHEN MY DEAR MAMMA DIED I WAS NOT NINE YEARS OLD AND I REMEMBER TWO DAYS BEFORE THE FUNERAL
2136-5140-0005 THERE CAME TO KNOWL WHERE SHE DIED A THIN LITTLE MAN WITH LARGE BLACK EYES AND A VERY GRAVE DARK FACE HE WAS SHUT UP A GOOD DEAL WITH MY DEAR FATHER WHO WAS IN DEEP AFFLICTION AND MISSUS RUSK USED TO SAY
2136-5140-0006 AND GOOD MISTER CLAY READY AT CALL IN THE VILLAGE MUCH GOOD THAT LITTLE BLACK WHIPPER SNAPPER WILL DO HIM WITH THAT LITTLE BLACK MAN ON THE DAY AFTER THE FUNERAL I WAS SENT OUT FOR SOME REASON FOR A WALK MY GOVERNESS WAS ILL I KNOW
2136-5140-0007 AND THERE WAS CONFUSION IN THE HOUSE AND I DARE SAY THE MAIDS MADE AS MUCH OF A HOLIDAY AS THEY COULD I REMEMBER FEELING A SORT OF AWE OF THIS LITTLE DARK MAN BUT I WAS NOT AFRAID OF HIM FOR HE WAS GENTLE THOUGH SAD AND SEEMED KIND
2136-5140-0008 HE LED ME INTO THE GARDEN THE DUTCH GARDEN WE USED TO CALL IT WITH A BALUSTRADE AND STATUES AT THE FARTHER FRONT LAID OUT IN A CARPET PATTERN OF BRILLIANTLY COLOURED FLOWERS WE CAME DOWN THE BROAD FLIGHT OF CAEN STONE STEPS INTO THIS
2136-5140-0009 AND WE WALKED IN SILENCE TO THE BALUSTRADE THE BASE WAS TOO HIGH AT THE SPOT WHERE WE REACHED IT FOR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HOLDING MY HAND HE SAID
2136-5140-0010 WELL YOU CAN'T BUT I CAN SEE BEYOND IT SHALL I TELL YOU WHAT I SEE EVER SO MUCH I SEE A COTTAGE WITH A STEEP ROOF THAT LOOKS LIKE GOLD IN THE SUNLIGHT
2136-5140-0011 GROWING BY THE WALLS AND WINDOWS AND TWO LITTLE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING AMONG THE STEMS OF THE TREES AND WE ARE ON OUR WAY THERE AND IN A FEW MINUTES SHALL BE UNDER THOSE TREES OURSELVES AND TALKING TO THOSE LITTLE CHILDREN
2136-5140-0012 YET NOW TO ME IT IS BUT A PICTURE IN MY BRAIN AND TO YOU BUT A STORY TOLD BY ME WHICH YOU BELIEVE COME DEAR LET US BE GOING SO WE DESCENDED THE STEPS AT THE RIGHT
2136-5140-0013 AND THERE WE STOOD IN RICH SUNLIGHT AMONG THE MANY OBJECTS HE HAD DESCRIBED IS THIS YOUR HOUSE MY LITTLE MEN HE ASKED OF THE CHILDREN PRETTY LITTLE ROSY BOYS WHO ASSENTED AND HE LEANED WITH HIS OPEN HAND AGAINST THE STEM OF ONE OF THE TREES
2136-5140-0014 THE SAME ON WHICH I WAS NOW LOOKING IN THE DISTANCE EVERY NOW AND THEN HE MADE ME SIT DOWN TO REST
2136-5140-0015 WOULD RELATE SOME LITTLE STORY REFLECTING EVEN TO MY CHILDISH MIND A STRANGE SUSPICION OF A SPIRITUAL MEANING
2136-5140-0016 AND SOMEHOW STARTLING IN ITS VERY VAGUENESS THUS ENTERTAINED THOUGH A LITTLE AWFULLY I ACCOMPANIED THE DARK MYSTERIOUS LITTLE WHIPPER SNAPPER THROUGH THE WOODLAND GLADES
2136-5140-0017 WE CAME TO ME QUITE UNEXPECTEDLY IN THE DEEP SYLVAN SHADOWS UPON THE GREY PILLARED TEMPLE FOUR FRONTED WITH A SLANTING PEDESTAL OF LICHEN STAINED STEPS
2136-5140-0018 THE LONELY SEPULCHRE IN WHICH I HAD THE MORNING BEFORE SEEN POOR MAMMA LAID AT THE SIGHT THE FOUNTAINS OF MY GRIEF REOPENED AND I CRIED BITTERLY REPEATING OH MAMMA MAMMA LITTLE MAMMA
2136-5140-0019 AND SO WENT ON WEEPING AND CALLING WILDLY ON THE DEAF AND THE SILENT THERE WAS A STONE BENCH SOME TEN STEPS AWAY FROM THE TOMB SIT DOWN BESIDE ME MY CHILD SAID THE GRAVE MAN WITH THE BLACK EYES VERY KINDLY AND GENTLY
2136-5140-0020 NOW WHAT DO YOU SEE THERE HE ASKED POINTING HORIZONTALLY WITH HIS STICK TOWARDS THE CENTRE OF THE OPPOSITE STRUCTURE OH THAT THAT PLACE WHERE POOR MAMMA IS
2136-5140-0021 YES A STONE WALL WITH PILLARS TOO HIGH FOR EITHER YOU OR ME TO SEE OVER BUT HERE HE MENTIONED A NAME WHICH I THINK MUST HAVE BEEN SWEDENBORG
2136-5140-0022 I ONLY KNOW THAT IT SOUNDED TO ME LIKE THE NAME OF A MAGICIAN IN A FAIRY TALE I FANCIED HE LIVED IN THE WOOD WHICH SURROUNDED US AND I BEGAN TO GROW FRIGHTENED AS HE PROCEEDED BUT SWEDENBORG SEES BEYOND IT OVER AND THROUGH IT
2136-5140-0023 AND HAS TOLD ME ALL THAT CONCERNS US TO KNOW HE SAYS YOUR MAMMA IS NOT THERE SHE IS TAKEN AWAY I CRIED STARTING UP AND WITH STREAMING EYES GAZING ON THE BUILDING WHICH THOUGH I STAMPED MY FEET IN MY DISTRACTION
2136-5140-0024 I WAS AFRAID TO APPROACH OH IS MAMMA TAKEN AWAY WHERE IS SHE WHERE HAVE THEY BROUGHT HER TO I WAS UTTERING UNCONSCIOUSLY VERY NEARLY THE QUESTION WITH WHICH MARY
2136-5140-0025 IN THE GREY OF THAT WONDROUS MORNING ON WHICH SHE STOOD BY THE EMPTY SEPULCHRE ACCOSTED THE FIGURE STANDING NEAR YOUR MAMMA IS ALIVE BUT TOO FAR AWAY TO SEE OR HEAR US SWEDENBORG STANDING HERE CAN SEE AND HEAR HER
2136-5140-0026 AND TELLS ME ALL HE SEES JUST AS I TOLD YOU IN THE GARDEN ABOUT THE LITTLE BOYS AND THE COTTAGE AND THE TREES AND FLOWERS WHICH YOU COULD NOT SEE
2136-5140-0027 SO I CAN TELL YOU NOW AS I DID THEN AND AS WE ARE BOTH I HOPE WALKING ON TO THE SAME PLACE JUST AS WE DID TO THE TREES AND COTTAGE
2136-5140-0028 HOW TRUE THE DESCRIPTION IS WHICH I GIVE YOU I WAS VERY FRIGHTENED FOR I FEARED THAT WHEN HE HAD DONE HIS NARRATIVE
2136-5140-0029 AND OF SHADOWS WHERE THE DEAD WERE VISIBLE HE LEANED HIS ELBOW ON HIS KNEE AND HIS FOREHEAD ON HIS HAND WHICH SHADED HIS DOWNCAST EYES IN THAT ATTITUDE HE DESCRIBED TO ME A BEAUTIFUL LANDSCAPE
2136-5140-0030 RADIANT WITH A WONDROUS LIGHT IN WHICH REJOICING MY MOTHER MOVED ALONG AN AIRY PATH ASCENDING AMONG MOUNTAINS OF FANTASTIC HEIGHT AND PEAKS MELTING IN CELESTIAL COLOURING INTO THE AIR
2136-5140-0031 HE SAID THE SAME WORDS HE HAD SPOKEN BEFORE COME DEAR LET US GO OH NO NO NO NOT NOW I SAID RESISTING AND VERY MUCH FRIGHTENED HOME I MEAN DEAR
2136-5140-0032 WE CANNOT WALK TO THE PLACE I HAVE DESCRIBED WE CAN ONLY REACH IT THROUGH THE GATE OF DEATH TO WHICH WE ARE ALL TENDING YOUNG AND OLD WITH SURE STEPS AND WHERE IS THE GATE OF DEATH I ASKED IN A SORT OF WHISPER AS WE WALKED TOGETHER
2136-5140-0033 HOLDING HIS HAND AND LOOKING STEALTHILY HE SMILED SADLY AND SAID WHEN SOONER OR LATER THE TIME COMES AS HAGAR'S EYES WERE OPENED IN THE WILDERNESS AND SHE BEHELD THE FOUNTAIN OF WATER
2136-5140-0034 SO SHALL EACH OF US SEE THE DOOR OPEN BEFORE US AND ENTER IN AND BE REFRESHED FOR A LONG TIME FOLLOWING THIS WALK I WAS VERY NERVOUS MORE SO FOR THE AWFUL MANNER IN WHICH MISSUS RUSK RECEIVED MY STATEMENT
2136-5140-0035 WITH STERN LIPS AND UPTURNED HANDS AND EYES AND AN ANGRY EXPOSTULATION I DO WONDER AT YOU MARY QUINCE LETTING THE CHILD WALK INTO THE WOOD WITH THAT LIMB OF DARKNESS IT IS A MERCY HE DID NOT SHOW HER THE DEVIL
2136-5140-0036 OR FRIGHTEN HER OUT OF HER SENSES IN THAT LONELY PLACE OF THESE SWEDENBORGIANS INDEED I KNOW NO MORE THAN I MIGHT LEARN FROM GOOD MISSUS RUSK'S VERY INACCURATE TALK TWO OR THREE OF THEM CROSSED IN THE COURSE OF MY EARLY LIFE
2136-5140-0037 BUT I GREW AFTER A DAY OR TWO SO NERVOUS THAT I LAID IT ASIDE IT IS ENOUGH FOR ME TO KNOW THAT THEIR FOUNDER EITHER SAW OR FANCIED HE SAW AMAZING VISIONS WHICH SO FAR FROM SUPERSEDING CONFIRMED
2136-5140-0038 AND INTERPRETED THE LANGUAGE OF THE BIBLE AND AS DEAR PAPA ACCEPTED THEIR IDEAS I AM HAPPY IN THINKING THAT THEY DID NOT CONFLICT WITH THE SUPREME AUTHORITY OF HOLY WRIT LEANING ON MY HAND I WAS NOW LOOKING UPON THAT SOLEMN WOOD
2136-5140-0039 WHITE AND SHADOWY IN THE MOONLIGHT WHERE FOR A LONG TIME AFTER THAT RAMBLE WITH THE VISIONARY I FANCIED THE GATE OF DEATH HIDDEN ONLY BY A STRANGE GLAMOUR AND THE DAZZLING LAND OF GHOSTS WERE SITUATE
2136-5140-0040 AND I SUPPOSE THESE EARLIER ASSOCIATIONS GAVE TO MY REVERIE ABOUT MY FATHER'S COMING VISITOR
2136-5143-0000 CHAPTER SIX A WALK IN THE WOOD TWO LITTLE PIECES OF BY PLAY IN WHICH I DETECTED HER CONFIRMED MY UNPLEASANT SUSPICION FROM THE CORNER OF THE GALLERY I ONE DAY SAW HER WHEN SHE THOUGHT I WAS OUT AND ALL QUIET
2136-5143-0001 WITH HER EAR AT THE KEYHOLE OF PAPA'S STUDY
2136-5143-0002 HER EYES WERE TURNED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE STAIRS FROM WHICH ONLY SHE APPREHENDED SURPRISE HER GREAT MOUTH WAS OPEN AND HER EYES ABSOLUTELY GOGGLED WITH EAGERNESS SHE WAS DEVOURING ALL THAT WAS PASSING THERE
2136-5143-0003 INDIGNATION HOWEVER QUICKLY RETURNED AND I CAME BACK TREADING BRISKLY AS I DID SO WHEN I REACHED THE ANGLE OF THE GALLERY AGAIN MADAME I SUPPOSE HAD HEARD ME FOR SHE WAS HALF WAY DOWN THE STAIRS
2136-5143-0004 I AM SO GLAD TO FIND YOU AND YOU ARE DRESS TO COME OUT WE SHALL HAVE SO PLEASANT WALK AT THAT MOMENT THE DOOR OF MY FATHER'S STUDY OPENED AND MISSUS RUSK WITH HER DARK ENERGETIC FACE VERY MUCH FLUSHED STEPPED OUT IN HIGH EXCITEMENT
2136-5143-0005 THE MASTER SAYS YOU MAY HAVE THE BRANDY BOTTLE MADAME AND I'M GLAD TO BE RID OF IT I AM MADAME COURTESIED WITH A GREAT SMIRK THAT WAS FULL OF INTANGIBLE HATE AND INSULT BETTER YOUR OWN BRANDY IF DRINK YOU MUST EXCLAIMED MISSUS RUSK
2136-5143-0006 YOU MAY COME TO THE STORE ROOM NOW OR THE BUTLER CAN TAKE IT AND OFF WHISKED MISSUS RUSK FOR THE BACK STAIRCASE THERE HAD BEEN NO COMMON SKIRMISH ON THIS OCCASION BUT A PITCHED BATTLE MADAME HAD MADE A SORT OF PET OF ANNE WIXTED AN UNDERCHAMBERMAID

2136-5143-0010 AND SOME DROPS OF LAUDANUM WHENEVER THE PAIN OF STOMACH RETURNED
2136-5143-0011 SHE CLAIMED HER MEDICINE MAN'S ESTIMATE OF WOMAN IS HIGHER THAN WOMAN'S OWN PERHAPS IN THEIR RELATIONS TO MEN THEY ARE GENERALLY MORE TRUSTWORTHY PERHAPS WOMAN'S IS THE JUSTER AND THE OTHER AN APPOINTED ILLUSION
2136-5143-0012 I DON'T KNOW BUT SO IT IS ORDAINED MISSUS RUSK WAS RECALLED AND I SAW AS YOU ARE AWARE MADAME'S PROCEDURE DURING THE INTERVIEW IT WAS A GREAT BATTLE A GREAT VICTORY MADAME WAS IN HIGH SPIRITS

2136-5147-0025 AND IT IS REALLY SUCH A PITY FOR SHE'S A VERY PRETTY CREATURE AND A CLEVER WOMAN COULD MAKE HER QUITE CHARMING
2136-5147-0026 EIGHT AND TWENTY YEARS AGO OR MORE WITH A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND POUNDS WELL YOU KNOW SHE HAS GOT EVER SO MUCH NOW
2136-5147-0027 AND THOUGH YOU WOULD NOT HAVE HER THEN SHE HAS HAD HER SECOND HUSBAND SINCE I CAN TELL YOU I'M GLAD I WAS NOT THE FIRST SAID MY FATHER WELL THEY REALLY SAY HER WEALTH IS ABSOLUTELY IMMENSE HER LAST HUSBAND
2136-5147-0028 THE RUSSIAN MERCHANT LEFT HER EVERYTHING SHE HAS NOT A HUMAN RELATION AND SHE IS IN THE BEST SET YOU WERE ALWAYS A MATCH MAKER MONICA SAID MY FATHER STOPPING AND PUTTING HIS HAND KINDLY ON HERS
2136-5147-0029 BUT IT WON'T DO NO NO MONICA WE MUST TAKE CARE OF LITTLE MAUD SOME OTHER WAY I WAS RELIEVED WE WOMEN HAVE ALL AN INSTINCTIVE DREAD OF SECOND MARRIAGES
2136-5147-0030 AND THINK THAT NO WIDOWER IS QUITE ABOVE OR BELOW THAT DANGER AND I REMEMBER WHENEVER MY FATHER WHICH INDEED WAS BUT SELDOM MADE A VISIT TO TOWN OR ANYWHERE ELSE IT WAS A SAYING OF MISSUS RUSK
2136-5147-0031 I SHAN'T WONDER NEITHER NEED YOU MY DEAR IF HE BRINGS HOME A YOUNG WIFE WITH HIM SO MY FATHER WITH A KIND LOOK AT HER AND A VERY TENDER ONE ON ME WENT SILENTLY TO THE LIBRARY AS HE OFTEN DID ABOUT THAT HOUR
2136-5147-0032 I SUPPOSE THEY DID NOT WISH A REVOLUTION AND ALL ITS CONSEQUENCES AT KNOWL AND THOUGHT IT NO HARM TO EXCITE MY VIGILANCE BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE LONG TO BE VEXED WITH COUSIN MONICA
2136-5147-0033 YOU KNOW MY DEAR YOUR FATHER IS AN ODDITY SHE SAID I DON'T MIND HIM I NEVER DID YOU MUST NOT CRACKY MY DEAR CRACKY DECIDEDLY CRACKY AND SHE TAPPED THE CORNER OF HER FOREHEAD WITH A LOOK SO SLY AND COMICAL
2136-5147-0034 THAT I THINK I SHOULD HAVE LAUGHED IF THE SENTIMENT HAD NOT BEEN SO AWFULLY IRREVERENT WELL DEAR HOW IS OUR FRIEND THE MILLINER MADAME IS SUFFERING SO MUCH FROM PAIN IN HER EAR THAT SHE SAYS IT WOULD BE QUITE IMPOSSIBLE TO HAVE THE HONOUR HONOUR FIDDLE
2136-5147-0035 PAIN IN HER EAR YOU SAY POOR THING WELL DEAR I THINK I CAN CURE THAT IN FIVE MINUTES I HAVE IT MYSELF NOW AND THEN COME TO MY ROOM AND WE'LL GET THE BOTTLES SO SHE LIGHTED HER CANDLE IN THE LOBBY AND WITH A LIGHT AND AGILE STEP
2136-5147-0036 SHE SCALED THE STAIRS I FOLLOWING AND HAVING FOUND THE REMEDIES WE APPROACHED MADAME'S ROOM TOGETHER I THINK WHILE WE WERE STILL AT THE END OF THE GALLERY MADAME HEARD AND DIVINED OUR APPROACH FOR HER DOOR SUDDENLY SHUT
2136-5147-0037 AND THERE WAS A FUMBLING AT THE HANDLE BUT THE BOLT WAS OUT OF ORDER
2136-5147-0038 THERE WAS NO ANSWER SO SHE OPENED THE DOOR AND WE BOTH ENTERED MADAME HAD ROLLED HERSELF IN THE BLUE COVERLET AND WAS LYING ON THE BED WITH HER FACE BURIED IN THE PILLOW AND ENVELOPED IN THE COVERING PERHAPS SHE'S ASLEEP SAID LADY KNOLLYS
2136-5147-0039 GETTING ROUND TO THE SIDE OF THE BED AND STOOPING OVER HER MADAME LAY STILL AS A MOUSE COUSIN MONICA SET DOWN HER TWO LITTLE VIALS ON THE TABLE AND STOOPING AGAIN OVER THE BED BEGAN VERY GENTLY WITH HER FINGERS TO LIFT THE COVERLET THAT COVERED HER FACE
2136-5147-0040 MADAME UTTERED A SLUMBERING MOAN AND TURNED MORE UPON HER FACE CLASPING THE COVERLET FASTER ABOUT HER MADAME IT IS MAUD AND LADY KNOLLYS WE HAVE COME TO RELIEVE YOUR EAR PRAY LET ME SEE IT
2159-179154-0000 COURTING A BROOMSTICK THE SIDE SHOW LET US NOW DESCRIBE SOME OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF HYPNOTISM TO SEE JUST HOW IT OPERATES AND HOW IT EXHIBITS ITSELF
2159-179154-0001 THE FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF A PUBLIC PERFORMANCE GIVEN BY DOCTOR HERBERT L FLINT A VERY SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC OPERATOR IT IS IN THE LANGUAGE OF AN EYE WITNESS A NEW YORK LAWYER
2159-179154-0002 IN RESPONSE TO A CALL FOR VOLUNTEERS TWENTY YOUNG AND MIDDLE AGED MEN CAME UPON THE STAGE THEY EVIDENTLY BELONGED TO THE GREAT MIDDLE CLASS THE ENTERTAINMENT COMMENCED BY DOCTOR FLINT PASSING AROUND THE GROUP
2159-179154-0003 WHO WERE SEATED ON THE STAGE IN A SEMICIRCLE FACING THE AUDIENCE AND STROKING EACH ONE'S HEAD AND FOREHEAD REPEATING THE PHRASES CLOSE YOUR EYES THINK OF NOTHING BUT SLEEP YOU ARE VERY TIRED YOU ARE DROWSY
2159-179154-0004 YOU FEEL VERY SLEEPY AS HE DID THIS SEVERAL OF THE VOLUNTEERS CLOSED THEIR EYES AT ONCE AND ONE FELL ASLEEP IMMEDIATELY ONE OR TWO REMAINED AWAKE
2159-179154-0005 WHILE A FEW WERE WIDE AWAKE AND SMILING AT THE REST THESE LATTER WERE DISMISSED AS UNLIKELY SUBJECTS WHEN THE STAGE HAD BEEN CLEARED OF ALL THOSE WHO WERE NOT RESPONSIVE THE DOCTOR PASSED AROUND AND SNAPPING HIS FINGER
2159-179154-0006 AT EACH INDIVIDUAL AWOKE HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WHEN QUESTIONED AFTERWARD AS TO WHAT SENSATION HE EXPERIENCED AT THE SNAPPING OF THE FINGERS REPLIED THAT IT SEEMED TO HIM AS IF SOMETHING INSIDE OF HIS HEAD RESPONDED
2159-179154-0007 AND WITH THIS SENSATION HE REGAINED SELF CONSCIOUSNESS THIS IS TO BE DOUBTED AS A RULE SUBJECTS IN THIS STAGE OF HYPNOTISM DO NOT FEEL ANY SENSATION THAT THEY CAN REMEMBER
2159-179154-0008 THAT YOU CAN'T PULL THEM APART THEY ARE FAST YOU CANNOT PULL THEM APART TRY YOU CAN'T THE WHOLE CLASS MADE FRANTIC EFFORTS TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS BUT WERE UNABLE TO DO SO THE DOCTOR'S EXPLANATION OF THIS IS
2159-179154-0009 THAT WHAT THEY WERE REALLY DOING WAS TO FORCE THEIR HANDS CLOSER TOGETHER THUS OBEYING THE COUNTER SUGGESTION THAT THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE TRYING TO UNCLASP THEIR HANDS WAS EVIDENT FROM THEIR ENDEAVORS
2159-179154-0010 ONE YOUNG FELLOW AGED ABOUT EIGHTEEN SAID THAT HE WAS ADDICTED TO THE CIGARETTE HABIT THE SUGGESTION WAS MADE TO HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SMOKE A CIGARETTE FOR TWENTY FOUR HOURS AFTER THE ENTERTAINMENT HE WAS ASKED TO SMOKE AS WAS HIS USUAL HABIT
2159-179154-0011 HE WAS THEN AWAY FROM ANY ONE WHO COULD INFLUENCE HIM HE REPLIED THAT THE VERY IDEA WAS REPUGNANT HOWEVER HE WAS INDUCED TO TAKE A CIGARETTE IN HIS MOUTH BUT IT MADE HIM ILL AND HE FLUNG IT AWAY WITH EVERY EXPRESSION OF DISGUST
2159-179154-0012 THIS IS AN INSTANCE OF WHAT IS CALLED POST HYPNOTIC SUGGESTION DOCTOR COCKE TELLS OF SUGGESTING TO A DRINKER WHOM HE WAS TRYING TO CURE OF THE HABIT THAT FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS ANYTHING HE TOOK WOULD MAKE HIM VOMIT
2159-179154-0013 THEY IMMEDIATELY BEGAN AND TWIRLED THEM FASTER AND FASTER IN SPITE OF THEIR EFFORTS TO STOP ONE OF THE SUBJECTS SAID HE THOUGHT OF NOTHING BUT THE STRANGE ACTION OF HIS HANDS AND SOMETIMES IT PUZZLED HIM TO KNOW WHY THEY WHIRLED
2159-179154-0014 AT THIS POINT DOCTOR FLINT'S DAUGHTER TOOK CHARGE OF THE CLASS SHE POINTED HER FINGER AT ONE OF THEM AND THE SUBJECT BEGAN TO LOOK STEADILY BEFORE HIM AT WHICH THE REST OF THE CLASS WERE HIGHLY AMUSED
2159-179154-0015 PRESENTLY THE SUBJECT'S HEAD LEANED FORWARD THE PUPILS OF HIS EYES DILATED AND ASSUMED A PECULIAR GLASSY STARE HE AROSE WITH A STEADY GLIDING GAIT
2159-179154-0016 THEN HE STOPPED MISS FLINT LED HIM TO THE FRONT OF THE STAGE AND LEFT HIM STANDING IN PROFOUND SLUMBER HE STOOD THERE STOOPING EYES SET AND VACANT FAST ASLEEP
2159-179154-0017 IN THE MEANTIME THE ACT HAD CAUSED GREAT LAUGHTER AMONG THE REST OF THE CLASS ONE YOUNG FELLOW IN PARTICULAR LAUGHED SO UPROARIOUSLY THAT TEARS COURSED DOWN HIS CHEEKS AND HE TOOK OUT HIS HANDKERCHIEF TO WIPE HIS EYES
2159-179154-0018 JUST AS HE WAS RETURNING IT TO HIS POCKET THE LADY SUDDENLY POINTED A FINGER AT HIM
2159-179154-0019 BUT THE MOMENT THE GESTURE WAS MADE HIS COUNTENANCE FELL HIS MIRTH STOPPED WHILE THAT OF HIS COMPANIONS REDOUBLED AND THE CHANGE WAS SO OBVIOUS THAT THE AUDIENCE SHARED IN THE LAUGHTER BUT THE SUBJECT NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD
2159-179154-0020 HIS EYES ASSUMED THE SAME EXPRESSION THAT HAD BEEN NOTICED IN HIS COMPANION'S HE TOO AROSE IN THE SAME ATTITUDE AS IF HIS HEAD WERE PULLING THE BODY ALONG AND FOLLOWING THE FINGER IN THE SAME WAY AS HIS PREDECESSOR
2159-179154-0021 ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A BROOMSTICK AND TOLD TO HUNT GAME IN THE WOODS BEFORE HIM ANOTHER WAS GIVEN A LARGE RAG DOLL AND TOLD THAT IT WAS AN INFANT AND THAT HE MUST LOOK AMONG THE AUDIENCE AND DISCOVER THE FATHER
2159-179154-0022 HE WAS INFORMED THAT HE COULD TELL WHO THE FATHER WAS BY THE SIMILARITY AND THE COLOR OF THE EYES THESE SUGGESTIONS WERE MADE IN A LOUD TONE MISS FLINT BEING NO NEARER ONE SUBJECT THAN ANOTHER
2159-179154-0023 THE BARE SUGGESTION WAS GIVEN AS NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE A NEWSBOY AND ARE SELLING PAPERS OR NOW THINK THAT YOU ARE HUNTING AND ARE GOING INTO THE WOODS TO SHOOT BIRDS SO THE PARTY WAS STARTED
2159-179154-0024 AT THE SAME TIME INTO THE AUDIENCE THE ONE WHO WAS IMPERSONATING A NEWSBOY WENT ABOUT CRYING HIS EDITION IN A LOUD VOICE WHILE THE HUNTER CRAWLED ALONG STEALTHILY AND CAREFULLY
2159-179154-0025 THE NEWSBOY EVEN ADOPTED THE WELL WORN DEVICE OF ASKING THOSE WHOM HE SOLICITED TO BUY TO HELP HIM GET RID OF HIS STOCK ONE MAN OFFERED HIM A CENT WHEN THE PRICE WAS TWO CENTS THE NEWSBOY CHAFFED THE WOULD BE PURCHASER
2159-179154-0026 AND TAKING HIM INTO THE CENTER OF THE STAGE SHOWED HIM A SMALL RIDING WHIP HE LOOKED AT IT INDIFFERENTLY ENOUGH HE WAS TOLD IT WAS A HOT BAR OF IRON BUT HE SHOOK HIS HEAD STILL INCREDULOUS
2159-179154-0027 THE SUGGESTION WAS REPEATED AND AS THE GLAZED LOOK CAME INTO HIS EYES THE INCREDULOUS LOOK DIED OUT EVERY MEMBER OF THE CLASS WAS FOLLOWING THE SUGGESTION MADE TO THE SUBJECT IN HAND ALL OF THEM HAD THE SAME EXPRESSION IN THEIR EYES THE DOCTOR SAID
2159-179154-0028 THAT HIS DAUGHTER WAS HYPNOTIZING THE WHOLE CLASS THROUGH THIS ONE INDIVIDUAL AS SHE SPOKE SHE LIGHTLY TOUCHED THE SUBJECT WITH THE END OF THE WHIP THE MOMENT THE SUBJECT FELT THE WHIP HE JUMPED AND SHRIEKED AS IF IT REALLY WERE A HOT IRON
2159-179154-0029 SHE TOUCHED EACH ONE OF THE CLASS IN SUCCESSION AND EVERY ONE MANIFESTED THE UTMOST PAIN AND FEAR ONE SUBJECT SAT DOWN ON THE FLOOR AND CRIED IN DIRE DISTRESS
2159-179154-0030 HAD THE SUGGESTION BEEN CONTINUED IT WOULD UNDOUBTEDLY HAVE RAISED A BLISTER ONE OF THE AMUSING EXPERIMENTS TRIED AT A LATER TIME WAS THAT OF A TALL YOUNG MAN DIFFIDENT PALE AND MODEST BEING GIVEN A BROOM CAREFULLY WRAPPED IN A SHEET
2159-179154-0031 AND TOLD THAT IT WAS HIS SWEETHEART HE ACCEPTED THE SITUATION AND SAT DOWN BY THE BROOM HE WAS A LITTLE SHEEPISH AT FIRST BUT EVENTUALLY HE GREW BOLDER AND SMILED UPON HER SUCH A SMILE AS MALVOLIO CASTS UPON OLIVIA
2159-179154-0032 THE MANNER IN WHICH LITTLE BY LITTLE HE VENTURED UPON A FAMILIAR FOOTING WAS EXCEEDINGLY FUNNY BUT WHEN IN A MOMENT OF CONFIDENT RESPONSE TO HIS WOOING HE CLASPED HER ROUND THE WAIST AND IMPRINTED A CHASTE KISS UPON THE BRUSHY PART OF THE BROOM
2159-179154-0033 DISGUISED BY THE SHEET THE HOUSE RESOUNDED WITH ROARS OF LAUGHTER THE SUBJECT HOWEVER WAS DEAF TO ALL OF THE NOISE HE WAS ABSORBED IN HIS COURTSHIP AND HE CONTINUED TO HUG THE BROOM AND EXHIBIT IN HIS FEATURES
2159-179154-0034 ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER AS THE SAYING IS AND ALL THE WORLD LOVES TO LAUGH AT HIM ONE OF THE SUBJECTS WAS TOLD THAT THE HEAD OF A MAN IN THE AUDIENCE WAS ON FIRE
2159-179154-0035 HE LOOKED FOR A MOMENT AND THEN DASHED DOWN THE PLATFORM INTO THE AUDIENCE AND SEIZING THE MAN'S HEAD VIGOROUSLY RUBBED IT AS THIS DID NOT EXTINGUISH THE FLAMES HE TOOK OFF HIS COAT AND PUT THE FIRE OUT IN DOING THIS HE SET HIS COAT ON FIRE
2159-179154-0036 THEN HE CALMLY RESUMED HIS GARMENT AND WALKED BACK TO THE STAGE THE SIDE SHOW CLOSED THE EVENING'S ENTERTAINMENT A YOUNG MAN WAS TOLD TO THINK OF HIMSELF AS MANAGING A SIDE SHOW AT A CIRCUS
2159-179154-0037 WHEN HIS MIND HAD ABSORBED THIS IDEA HE WAS ORDERED TO OPEN HIS EXHIBITION HE AT ONCE MOUNTED A TABLE AND IN THE VOICE OF THE TRADITIONAL SIDE SHOW FAKIR BEGAN TO DILATE UPON THE FAT WOMAN AND THE SNAKES
2159-179154-0038 THAT FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS THEY COULD SEE MORE WONDERS THAN EVER BEFORE HAD BEEN CROWDED UNDER ONE CANVAS TENT HE HARANGUED THE CROWD AS THEY SURGED ABOUT THE TENT DOOR
2159-179154-0039 HE POINTED TO A SUPPOSITIOUS CANVAS PICTURE HE CHAFFED THE BOYS HE FLATTERED THE VANITY OF THE YOUNG FELLOWS WITH THEIR GIRLS TELLING THEM THAT THEY COULD NOT AFFORD FOR THE SMALL SUM OF TEN CENTS TO MISS THIS GREAT SHOW
2159-179156-0000 HOW THE SUBJECT FEELS UNDER HYPNOTIZATION DOCTOR COOPER'S EXPERIENCE EFFECT OF MUSIC DOCTOR ALFRED MARTHIEU'S EXPERIMENTS
2159-179156-0001 THE SENSATIONS PRODUCED DURING A STATE OF HYPNOSIS ARE VERY INTERESTING AS MAY BE SUPPOSED THEY DIFFER GREATLY IN DIFFERENT PERSONS
2159-179156-0002 ONE OF THE MOST INTERESTING ACCOUNTS EVER GIVEN IS THAT OF DOCTOR JAMES R COCKE A HYPNOTIST HIMSELF WHO SUBMITTED TO BEING OPERATED UPON BY A PROFESSIONAL MAGNETIZER
2159-179156-0003 HE WAS AT THAT TIME A FIRM BELIEVER IN THE THEORY OF PERSONAL MAGNETISM A DELUSION FROM WHICH HE AFTERWARD ESCAPED ON THE OCCASION WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE OPERATOR COMMANDED HIM TO CLOSE HIS EYES
2159-179156-0004 BUT HE DID OPEN THEM AT ONCE AGAIN HE TOLD HIM TO CLOSE THE EYES AND AT THE SAME TIME HE GENTLY STROKED HIS HEAD AND FACE AND EYELIDS WITH HIS HAND DOCTOR COCKE FANCIED HE FELT A TINGLING SENSATION IN HIS FOREHEAD AND EYES
2159-179156-0005 WHICH HE SUPPOSED CAME FROM THE HAND OF THE OPERATOR AFTERWARD HE CAME TO BELIEVE THAT THIS SENSATION WAS PURELY IMAGINARY ON HIS PART THEN HE SAYS A SENSATION AKIN TO FEAR CAME OVER ME
2159-179156-0006 THE OPERATOR SAID YOU ARE GOING TO SLEEP YOU ARE GETTING SLEEPY YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT MY HEART WAS BEATING RAPIDLY AND I FELT A SENSATION OF TERROR
2159-179156-0007 HE THEN MADE PASSES OVER MY HEAD DOWN OVER MY HANDS AND BODY BUT DID NOT TOUCH ME HE THEN SAID TO ME YOU CANNOT OPEN YOUR EYES THE MOTOR APPARATUS OF MY LIDS WOULD NOT SEEMINGLY RESPOND TO MY WILL
2159-179156-0008 YET I WAS CONSCIOUS THAT WHILE ONE PART OF MY MIND WANTED TO OPEN MY EYES ANOTHER PART DID NOT WANT TO SO I WAS IN A PARADOXICAL STATE I BELIEVED THAT I COULD OPEN MY EYES AND YET COULD NOT
2159-179156-0009 THE FEELING OF NOT WISHING TO OPEN MY EYES WAS NOT BASED UPON ANY DESIRE TO PLEASE THE OPERATOR I HAD NO PERSONAL INTEREST IN HIM IN ANY WAY BUT BE IT UNDERSTOOD I FIRMLY BELIEVED IN HIS POWER TO CONTROL ME
2159-179156-0010 THEN HE STROKED THE ARM AND SAID IT WAS GROWING NUMB HE SAID YOU HAVE NO FEELING IN IT HAVE YOU DOCTOR COCKE GOES ON I SAID NO AND I KNEW THAT I SAID NO
2159-179156-0011 THE OPERATOR WENT ON PRICKING THE ARM WITH A PIN AND THOUGH DOCTOR COCKE FELT THE PAIN HE SAID HE DID NOT FEEL IT AND AT THE SAME TIME THE SENSATION OF TERROR INCREASED I WAS NOT CONSCIOUS OF MY BODY AT ALL HE SAYS FURTHER ON
2159-179156-0012 BUT I WAS PAINFULLY CONSCIOUS OF THE TWO CONTRADICTORY ELEMENTS WITHIN ME I KNEW THAT MY BODY EXISTED BUT COULD NOT PROVE IT TO MYSELF I KNEW THAT THE STATEMENTS MADE BY THE OPERATOR WERE IN A MEASURE UNTRUE
2159-179156-0013 I OBEYED THEM VOLUNTARILY AND INVOLUNTARILY THIS IS THE LAST REMEMBRANCE THAT I HAVE OF THAT HYPNOTIC EXPERIENCE AFTER THIS HOWEVER THE OPERATOR CAUSED THE DOCTOR TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS WHICH HE LEARNED OF FROM HIS FRIENDS AFTER THE PERFORMANCE WAS OVER
2159-179156-0014 IT SEEMED TO ME THAT THE HYPNOTIST COMMANDED ME TO AWAKE AS SOON AS I DROPPED MY ARM AND YET TEN MINUTES OF UNCONSCIOUSNESS HAD PASSED ON A SUBSEQUENT OCCASION DOCTOR COCKE WHO WAS BLIND WAS PUT INTO A DEEP HYPNOTIC SLEEP
2159-179156-0015 BY FIXING HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND THIS TIME HE EXPERIENCED A STILL GREATER DEGREE OF TERROR AND INCIDENTALLY LEARNED THAT HE COULD HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF THE MATTER OF SELF HYPNOTISM
2159-179156-0016 WE SHALL CONSIDER IN ANOTHER CHAPTER IN THIS CONNECTION WE FIND GREAT INTEREST IN AN ARTICLE IN THE MEDICAL NEWS JULY TWENTY EIGHTH EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR
2159-179156-0017 IN WHICH HE DESCRIBES THE EFFECTS OF MUSIC UPON HYPNOTIC SUBJECTS WHILE IN VIENNA HE TOOK OCCASION TO OBSERVE CLOSELY THE ENTHUSIASTIC MUSICAL DEVOTEES AS THEY SAT IN THE AUDIENCE AT THE PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF WAGNER'S OPERAS
2159-179156-0018 HE BELIEVED THEY WERE IN A CONDITION OF SELF INDUCED HYPNOTISM IN WHICH THEIR SUBJECTIVE FACULTIES WERE SO EXALTED AS TO SUPERSEDE THEIR OBJECTIVE PERCEPTIONS MUSIC WAS NO LONGER TO THEM A SUCCESSION OF PLEASING SOUNDS
2159-179156-0019 BUT THE EMBODIMENT OF A DRAMA IN WHICH THEY BECAME SO WRAPPED UP THAT THEY FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE MECHANICAL AND EXTERNAL FEATURES OF THE MUSIC AND LIVED COMPLETELY IN A FAIRY WORLD OF DREAM
2159-179156-0020 THIS OBSERVATION SUGGESTED TO HIM AN INTERESTING SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS HIS FIRST SUBJECT WAS EASILY HYPNOTIZED AND OF AN EMOTIONAL NATURE WAGNER'S
2159-179156-0021 WAS PLAYED FROM THE PIANO SCORE THE PULSE OF THE SUBJECT BECAME MORE RAPID AND AT FIRST OF HIGHER TENSION INCREASING FROM A NORMAL RATE OF SIXTY BEATS A MINUTE TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THEN
2159-179156-0022 AS THE MUSIC PROGRESSED THE TENSION DIMINISHED THE RESPIRATION INCREASED FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY PER MINUTE GREAT EXCITEMENT IN THE SUBJECT WAS EVIDENT HIS WHOLE BODY WAS THROWN INTO MOTION HIS LEGS WERE DRAWN UP HIS ARMS TOSSED INTO THE AIR
2159-179156-0023 THE STATE OF MIND BROUGHT UP BEFORE HIM IN THE MOST REALISTIC AND VIVID MANNER POSSIBLE THE PICTURE OF THE RIDE OF TAM O'SHANTER WHICH HE HAD SEEN YEARS BEFORE THE PICTURE
2159-179156-0024 SOON BECAME REAL TO HIM AND HE FOUND HIMSELF TAKING PART IN A WILD CHASE NOT AS WITCH DEVIL OR TAM EVEN BUT IN SOME WAY HIS CONSCIOUSNESS WAS SPREAD THROUGH EVERY PART OF THE SCENE BEING OF IT
2159-179156-0025 AND YET PLAYING THE PART OF SPECTATOR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE IN DREAMS DOCTOR WARTHIN TRIED THE SAME EXPERIMENT AGAIN THIS TIME ON A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS NOT SO EMOTIONAL AND WAS HYPNOTIZED WITH MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY
2159-179156-0026 THIS SUBJECT DID NOT PASS INTO SUCH A DEEP STATE OF HYPNOTISM BUT THE RESULT WAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME THE PULSE RATE ROSE FROM SEVENTY TO ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THE SENSATION REMEMBERED WAS THAT OF RIDING FURIOUSLY THROUGH THE AIR
2159-179156-0027 THE EXPERIMENT WAS REPEATED ON OTHER SUBJECTS IN ALL CASES WITH THE SAME RESULT
2159-179156-0028 TO HIM IT ALWAYS EXPRESSED THE PICTURED WILD RIDE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF WOTAN THE SUBJECT TAKING PART IN THE RIDE IT WAS NOTICEABLE IN EACH CASE THAT THE SAME MUSIC PLAYED TO THEM IN THE WAKING STATE PRODUCED NO SPECIAL IMPRESSION
2159-179156-0029 AT FIRST IT SEEMED TO PRODUCE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT FOR THE PULSE WAS LOWERED LATER IT ROSE TO A RATE DOUBLE THE NORMAL AND THE TENSION WAS DIMINISHED THE IMPRESSION DESCRIBED BY THE SUBJECT AFTERWARD
2159-179156-0030 AND THE SUBJECT SEEMED TO CONTEMPLATE A LANDSCAPE OF LOFTY GRANDEUR A DIFFERENT SORT OF MUSIC WAS PLAYED
2159-179156-0031 APPEARS TO SUMMON SIGMUND TO VALHALLA
2159-179156-0032 IT BECAME SLOW AND IRREGULAR AND VERY SMALL THE RESPIRATION DECREASED ALMOST TO GASPING THE FACE GREW PALE AND A COLD PERSPIRATION BROKE OUT READERS WHO ARE ESPECIALLY INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT
2159-179156-0033 WILL FIND DESCRIPTIONS OF MANY OTHER INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN THE SAME ARTICLE DOCTOR COCKE DESCRIBES A PECULIAR TRICK HE PLAYED UPON THE SIGHT OF A SUBJECT SAYS HE I ONCE HYPNOTIZED A MAN
2159-179156-0034 AND CALL THE LETTERS AS I DIRECTED STIMULATION WAS IN THIS CASE IMPOSSIBLE AS I MADE HIM READ FIFTEEN OR TWENTY PAGES HE CALLING THE LETTERS AS SUGGESTED EACH TIME THEY OCCURRED THE EXTRAORDINARY HEIGHTENING
2159-179156-0035 AND CLAIRVOYANCE IF THE POWERS OF THE MIND ARE SO ENORMOUSLY INCREASED ALL THAT IS REQUIRED OF A VERY SENSITIVE AND EASILY HYPNOTIZED PERSON IS TO HYPNOTIZE HIM OR HERSELF WHEN HE WILL BE ABLE TO READ THOUGHTS
2159-179157-0000 AND IT IS TRUE THAT A PERSON CAN DELIBERATELY HYPNOTIZE HIMSELF WHEN HE WISHES TO TILL HE HAS BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO IT AND IS EXPERT IN IT SO TO SPEAK IT DOES AWAY AT A STROKE WITH THE CLAIMS OF ALL PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTISTS AND MAGNETIC HEALERS
2159-179157-0001 THAT THEY HAVE ANY PECULIAR POWER IN THEMSELVES WHICH THEY EXERT OVER THEIR FELLOWS ONE OF THESE PROFESSIONALS GIVES AN ACCOUNT IN HIS BOOK OF WHAT HE CALLS THE WONDERFUL LOCK METHOD HE SAYS THAT
2159-179157-0002 THOUGH HE IS LOCKED UP IN A SEPARATE ROOM HE CAN MAKE THE PSYCHIC POWER WORK THROUGH THE WALLS ALL THAT HE DOES IS TO PUT HIS SUBJECTS IN THE WAY OF HYPNOTIZING THEMSELVES
2159-179157-0003 HE SHOWS HIS INCONSISTENCY WHEN HE STATES THAT UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE HYPNOTIZER IS IN DANGER OF BECOMING HYPNOTIZED HIMSELF IN THIS HE MAKES NO CLAIM THAT THE SUBJECT IS USING ANY PSYCHIC POWER
2159-179157-0004 BUT OF COURSE IF THE HYPNOTIZER LOOKS STEADILY INTO THE EYES OF HIS SUBJECT AND THE SUBJECT LOOKS INTO HIS EYES THE STEADY GAZE ON A BRIGHT OBJECT WILL PRODUCE HYPNOTISM IN ONE QUITE AS READILY AS IN THE OTHER
2159-179157-0005 HYPNOTISM IS AN ESTABLISHED SCIENTIFIC FACT BUT THE CLAIM THAT THE HYPNOTIZER HAS ANY MYSTERIOUS PSYCHIC POWER IS THE INVARIABLE MARK OF THE CHARLATAN
2159-179157-0006 PROBABLY NO SCIENTIFIC PHENOMENON WAS EVER SO GROSSLY PROSTITUTED TO BASE ENDS AS THAT OF HYPNOTISM LATER WE SHALL SEE SOME OF THE OUTRAGEOUS FORMS THIS CHARLATANISM ASSUMES
2159-179157-0007 AND HOW IT EXTENDS TO THE PROFESSIONAL SUBJECTS AS WELL AS TO THE PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS TILL THOSE SUBJECTS EVEN IMPOSE UPON SCIENTIFIC MEN WHO OUGHT TO BE PROOF AGAINST SUCH DECEPTION
2159-179157-0008 MOREOVER THE POSSIBILITY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION CAREFULLY CONCEALED AND CALLED BY ANOTHER NAME OPENS ANOTHER GREAT FIELD OF HUMBUG AND CHARLATANISM OF WHICH THE ADVERTISING COLUMNS OF THE NEWSPAPERS ARE CONSTANTLY FILLED
2159-179157-0009 NAMELY THAT OF THE CLAIRVOYANT AND MEDIUM WE MAY CONCEIVE HOW SUCH A PROFESSION MIGHT BECOME PERFECTLY LEGITIMATE AND HIGHLY USEFUL BUT AT PRESENT IT SEEMS AS IF ANY PERSON WHO WENT INTO IT
2159-179157-0010 HOWEVER HONEST HE MIGHT BE AT THE START SOON BEGAN TO DECEIVE HIMSELF AS WELL AS OTHERS UNTIL HE LOST HIS POWER ENTIRELY TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN FACT AND IMAGINATION BEFORE DISCUSSING THE MATTER FURTHER
2159-179157-0011 LET US QUOTE DOCTOR COCKE'S EXPERIMENT IN HYPNOTIZING HIMSELF IT WILL BE REMEMBERED THAT A PROFESSIONAL HYPNOTIZER OR MAGNETIZER HAD HYPNOTIZED HIM BY TELLING HIM TO FIX HIS MIND ON THE NUMBER TWENTY SIX AND HOLDING UP HIS HAND
2159-179157-0012 I WAS INTENSELY COLD MY HEART SEEMED TO STAND STILL I HAD RINGING IN MY EARS MY HAIR SEEMED TO RISE UPON MY SCALP I PERSISTED IN THE EFFORT AND THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NOISE IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER AND LOUDER
2159-179157-0013 THE ROAR BECAME DEAFENING IT CRACKLED LIKE A MIGHTY FIRE I WAS FEARFULLY CONSCIOUS OF MYSELF HAVING READ VIVID ACCOUNTS OF DREAMS VISIONS ET CETERA IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT I WOULD EXPERIENCE THEM
2159-179157-0014 I FELT IN A VAGUE WAY THAT THERE WERE BEINGS ALL ABOUT ME BUT COULD NOT HEAR THEIR VOICES I FELT AS THOUGH EVERY MUSCLE IN MY BODY WAS FIXED AND RIGID
2159-179157-0015 THE ROAR IN MY EARS GREW LOUDER STILL AND I HEARD ABOVE THE ROAR REPORTS WHICH SOUNDED LIKE ARTILLERY AND MUSKETRY THEN ABOVE THE DIN OF THE NOISE A MUSICAL CHORD I SEEMED TO BE ABSORBED IN THIS CHORD I KNEW NOTHING ELSE
2159-179157-0016 SECONDLY I WISHED TO BE HYPNOTIZED THESE TOGETHER WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION AND STRAINED ATTENTION BROUGHT ON THE STATES WHICH OCCURRED
2159-179157-0017 HIS DESCRIPTIONS OF DREAMS BEAR A WONDERFUL LIKENESS TO DE QUINCEY'S DREAMS SUCH AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE ENGLISH MAIL COACH DE PROFUNDIS AND THE CONFESSIONS OF AN ENGLISH OPIUM EATER
2159-179157-0018 ALL OF WHICH WERE PRESUMABLY DUE TO OPIUM THE CAUSES WHICH DOCTOR COCKE THINKS PRODUCED THE HYPNOTIC CONDITION IN HIS CASE NAMELY BELIEF DESIRE TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND STRAINED ATTENTION UNITED WITH A VIVID IMAGINATION
2159-179157-0019 ARE CAUSES WHICH ARE OFTEN FOUND IN CONJUNCTION AND PRODUCE EFFECTS WHICH WE MAY REASONABLY EXPLAIN ON THE THEORY OF SELF HYPNOTIZATION
2159-179157-0020 FOR INSTANCE THE EFFECTS OF AN EXCITING RELIGIOUS REVIVAL ARE VERY LIKE THOSE PRODUCED BY MESMER'S OPERATIONS IN PARIS THE SUBJECTS BECOME HYSTERICAL AND ARE READY TO BELIEVE ANYTHING OR DO ANYTHING
2159-179157-0021 BY PROLONGING THE OPERATION A WHOLE COMMUNITY BECOMES MORE OR LESS HYPNOTIZED IN ALL SUCH CASES HOWEVER UNUSUAL EXCITEMENT IS COMMONLY FOLLOWED BY UNUSUAL LETHARGY
2159-179157-0022 IN FACT IT IS A SORT OF INTOXICATION THE SAME PHENOMENA ARE PROBABLY ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE STRANGE RECORDS OF HISTORY THE WONDERFUL CURES AT LOURDES OF WHICH WE HAVE READ IN ZOLA'S NOVEL OF THAT NAME
2159-179157-0023 ARE NO DOUBT THE EFFECT OF HYPNOTIZATION BY THE PRIESTS SOME OF THE STRANGE MOVEMENTS OF WHOLE COMMUNITIES DURING THE CRUSADES ARE TO BE EXPLAINED EITHER ON THE THEORY OF HYPNOTIZATION OR OF CONTAGION
2159-179157-0024 AND POSSIBLY THESE TWO THINGS WILL TURN OUT TO BE MUCH THE SAME IN FACT ON NO OTHER GROUND CAN WE EXPLAIN THE SO CALLED CHILDREN'S CRUSADE IN WHICH OVER THIRTY THOUSAND CHILDREN FROM GERMANY FROM ALL CLASSES OF THE COMMUNITY
2159-179157-0025 TRIED TO CROSS THE ALPS IN WINTER AND IN THEIR STRUGGLES WERE ALL LOST OR SOLD INTO SLAVERY WITHOUT EVEN REACHING THE HOLY LAND AGAIN HYPNOTISM IS ACCOUNTABLE FOR MANY OF THE POET'S DREAMS
2159-179157-0026 GAZING STEADILY AT A BED OF BRIGHT COALS OR A STREAM OF RUNNING WATER WILL INVARIABLY THROW A SENSITIVE SUBJECT INTO A HYPNOTIC SLEEP THAT WILL LAST SOMETIMES FOR SEVERAL HOURS DOCTOR COCKE SAYS
2159-179157-0027 THAT HE HAS EXPERIMENTED IN THIS DIRECTION WITH PATIENTS OF HIS SAYS HE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESIST THE STATE OR TO BRING IT AT WILL MANY OF THEM DESCRIBE BEAUTIFUL SCENES FROM NATURE OR SOME MIGHTY CATHEDRAL
2159-179157-0028 WITH ITS LOFTY DOME OR THE FACES OF IMAGINARY BEINGS BEAUTIFUL OR DEMONIACAL ACCORDING TO THE WILL AND TEMPER OF THE SUBJECT PERHAPS THE MOST WONDERFUL EXAMPLE OF SELF HYPNOTISM WHICH WE HAVE IN HISTORY
2159-179157-0029 IS THAT OF THE MYSTIC SWEDENBORG WHO SAW SUCH STRANGE THINGS IN HIS VISIONS AND AT LAST CAME TO BELIEVE IN THEM AS REAL THE SAME EXPLANATION MAY BE GIVEN OF THE MANIFESTATIONS OF ORIENTAL PROPHETS
2159-179157-0030 FOR IN THE ORIENT HYPNOTISM IS MUCH EASIER AND MORE SYSTEMATICALLY DEVELOPED THAN WITH US OF THE WEST THE PERFORMANCES OF THE DERVISHES AND ALSO OF THE FAKIRS WHO WOUND THEMSELVES AND PERFORM MANY WONDERFUL FEATS
2159-179157-0031 THEIR IMPERSONATIONS ARE RIDICULOUS IN THE EXTREME ONE MAN I REMEMBER BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLES SUMNER BEING UNEDUCATED HE USED THE MOST WRETCHED ENGLISH
2159-179157-0032 AND HIS LANGUAGE WAS UTTERLY DEVOID OF SENSE WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND A VERY INTELLIGENT LADY WHO BELIEVED HERSELF TO BE CONTROLLED BY THE SPIRIT OF CHARLOTTE CUSHMAN PERSONATED THE PART VERY WELL DOCTOR COOKE SAYS OF HIMSELF
2159-179157-0033 I CAN HYPNOTIZE MYSELF TO SUCH AN EXTENT THAT I WILL BECOME WHOLLY UNCONSCIOUS OF EVENTS TAKING PLACE AROUND ME AND A LONG INTERVAL OF TIME SAY FROM ONE HALF TO TWO HOURS WILL BE A COMPLETE BLANK
2182-150130-0000 THE SUMMER PASSED AWAY AND THE BLEAK FALL CAME MYLES HAD LONG SINCE ACCEPTED HIS POSITION AS ONE SET APART FROM THE OTHERS OF HIS KIND AND HAD RESIGNED HIMSELF TO THE EVIDENT FACT THAT HE WAS NEVER TO SERVE IN THE HOUSEHOLD IN WAITING UPON THE EARL
2182-150130-0001 THE OTHER LADS WERE SOMETIMES OCCUPIED BY THEIR HOUSEHOLD DUTIES WHEN SPORTS WERE AFOOT IN WHICH THEY WOULD LIKED TO HAVE TAKEN PART MYLES WAS ALWAYS FREE TO ENTER INTO ANY MATTER OF THE KIND AFTER HIS DAILY EXERCISE HAD BEEN PERFORMED AT THE PELS THE BUTTS OR THE TILTING COURT
2182-150130-0002 THE LADY ANNE THE DAUGHTER OF THE HOUSE A TALL THIN DARK EYED DARK HAIRED HANDSOME YOUNG DAME OF TWENTY OR TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HAWK NOSED LIKE HER FATHER AND SILENT PROUD AND HAUGHTY MYLES HEARD THE SQUIRES SAY
2182-150130-0003 LADY ALICE THE EARL OF MACKWORTH'S NIECE AND WARD A GREAT HEIRESS IN HER OWN RIGHT A STRIKINGLY PRETTY BLACK EYED GIRL OF FOURTEEN OR FIFTEEN THESE COMPOSED THE EARL'S PERSONAL FAMILY
2182-150130-0004 BUT BESIDES THEM WAS LORD GEORGE BEAUMONT HIS EARL'S BROTHER AND HIM MYLES SOON CAME TO KNOW BETTER THAN ANY OF THE CHIEF PEOPLE OF THE CASTLE EXCEPTING SIR JAMES LEE FOR SINCE MYLES'S GREAT BATTLE IN THE ARMORY LORD GEORGE
2182-150130-0005 FOR THE PRINCELY NOBLES OF THOSE DAYS LIVED IN STATE LITTLE LESS ROYAL THAN ROYALTY ITSELF MOST OF THE KNIGHTS AND GENTLEMEN MYLES SOON CAME TO KNOW BY SIGHT MEETING THEM IN LORD GEORGE'S APARTMENTS IN THE SOUTH WING OF THE GREAT HOUSE
2182-150130-0006 AND SOME OF THEM FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF LORD GEORGE SINGLED HIM OUT FOR FRIENDLY NOTICE GIVING HIM A NOD OR A WORD IN PASSING EVERY SEASON HAS ITS PLEASURES FOR BOYS AND THE CONSTANT CHANGE THAT THEY BRING IS ONE OF THE GREATEST DELIGHTS OF BOYHOOD'S DAYS
2182-150130-0007 ALL OF US AS WE GROW OLDER HAVE IN OUR MEMORY PICTURES OF BY GONE TIMES THAT ARE SOMEHOW MORE THAN USUALLY VIVID THE COLORS OF SOME NOT BLURRING BY TIME AS OTHERS DO
2182-150130-0008 ONE OF WHICH IN REMEMBERING ALWAYS FILLED MYLES'S HEART IN AFTER YEARS WITH AN INDEFINABLE PLEASURE WAS THE RECOLLECTION OF STANDING WITH OTHERS OF HIS FELLOW SQUIRES
2182-150130-0009 WHICH WHEN THE EAST WIND WAS STRAINING FLEW LOW OVERHEAD TO PITCH TO THE LAKE IN THE FORBIDDEN PRECINCTS OF THE DEER PARK BEYOND THE BROW OF THE HILL
2182-150130-0010 SHOT IN THEIR SOUTHWARD FLIGHT BY THE LADS AND COOKED BY FAT GOOD NATURED MOTHER JOAN GRACED THE RUDE MESS TABLE OF THE SQUIRES IN THE LONG HALL AND EVEN THE TOUGHEST AND FISHIEST DRAKE SO THE FRUIT OF THEIR SKILL HAD A SAVOR THAT SOMEHOW OR OTHER
2182-150130-0011 THE DAINTIEST FARE LACKED IN AFTER YEARS THEN FALL PASSED AND WINTER CAME BLEAK COLD AND DREARY NOT WINTER AS WE KNOW IT NOWADAYS WITH WARM FIRES AND BRIGHT LIGHTS TO MAKE THE LONG NIGHTS SWEET AND CHEERFUL WITH COMFORT
2182-150130-0012 BUT WINTER WITH ALL ITS GRIMNESS AND STERNNESS IN THE GREAT COLD STONE WALLED CASTLES OF THOSE DAYS THE ONLY FIRE AND ALMOST THE ONLY LIGHT WERE THOSE FROM THE HUGE BLAZING LOGS THAT ROARED AND CRACKLED IN THE GREAT OPEN STONE FIREPLACE
2182-150130-0013 AROUND WHICH THE FOLKS GATHERED SHELTERING THEIR FACES AS BEST THEY COULD FROM THE SCORCHING HEAT AND CLOAKING THEIR SHOULDERS FROM THE BITING COLD FOR AT THE FARTHER END OF THE ROOM WHERE GIANT SHADOWS SWAYED AND BOWED AND DANCED HUGE AND BLACK AGAINST THE HIGH WALLS
2182-150130-0014 BUT AT THE BEST ONLY RUDE STORIES AND JESTS RECITED BY SOME STROLLING MUMMER OR MINSTREL TO THE LISTENING CIRCLE GATHERED AROUND THE BLAZE AND WELCOMING THE COARSE GROSS JESTS AND COARSER GROSSER SONGS WITH ROARS OF BOISTEROUS LAUGHTER
2182-150130-0015 YET BLEAK AND DREARY AS WAS THE WINTER IN THOSE DAYS AND COLD AND BITING AS WAS THE FROST IN THE CHEERLESS WINDY HALLS AND CORRIDORS OF THE CASTLE IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS JOYS TO THE YOUNG LADS FOR THEN AS NOW BOYS COULD FIND PLEASURE EVEN IN SLUSHY WEATHER
2182-150130-0016 WHEN THE SODDEN SNOW IS FIT FOR NOTHING BUT TO MAKE SNOWBALLS OF THRICE THAT BITTER WINTER THE MOAT WAS FROZEN OVER AND THE LADS MAKING THEMSELVES SKATES OF MARROW BONES WHICH THEY BOUGHT FROM THE HALL COOK AT A GROAT A PAIR WENT SKIMMING OVER THE SMOOTH SURFACE
2182-150130-0017 WHILE THE CROWS AND THE JACKDAWS LOOKED DOWN AT THEM FROM THE TOP OF THE BLEAK GRAY WALLS THEN AT YULE TIDE WHICH WAS SOMEWHAT OF A RUDE SEMBLANCE TO THE MERRY CHRISTMAS SEASON OF OUR DAY A GREAT FEAST WAS HELD IN THE HALL
2182-150130-0018 AND ALL THE CASTLE FOLK WERE FED IN THE PRESENCE OF THE EARL AND THE COUNTESS OXEN AND SHEEP WERE ROASTED WHOLE HUGE SUET PUDDINGS MADE OF BARLEY MEAL SWEETENED WITH HONEY AND STUFFED WITH PLUMS WERE BOILED IN GREAT CALDRONS IN THE OPEN COURTYARD
2182-150130-0019 WHOLE BARRELS OF ALE AND MALMSEY WERE BROACHED AND ALL THE FOLK GENTLE AND SIMPLE WERE BIDDEN TO THE FEAST AFTERWARDS THE MINSTRELS DANCED AND PLAYED A RUDE PLAY AND IN THE EVENING A MIRACLE SHOW WAS PERFORMED ON A RAISED PLATFORM IN THE NORTH HALL
2182-150130-0020 FOR A WEEK AFTERWARDS THE CASTLE WAS FED UPON THE REMAINS OF THE GOOD THINGS LEFT FROM THAT GREAT FEAST UNTIL EVERYONE GREW TO LOATHE FINE VICTUALS AND LONGED FOR HONEST BEEF AND MUSTARD AGAIN THEN AT LAST IN THAT CONSTANT CHANGE THE WINTER WAS GONE
2182-150130-0021 AND EVEN THE LADS WHO HAD ENJOYED ITS PASSING WERE GLAD WHEN THE WINDS BLEW WARM ONCE MORE AND THE GRASS SHOWED GREEN IN SUNNY PLACES AND THE LEADER OF THE WILD FOWL BLEW HIS HORN AS THEY WHO IN THE FALL HAD FLOWN TO THE SOUTH FLEW ARROW LIKE NORTHWARD AGAIN
2182-150130-0022 WHEN THE BUDS SWELLED AND THE LEAVES BURST FORTH ONCE MORE AND CROCUSES AND THEN DAFFODILS GLEAMED IN THE GREEN GRASS LIKE SPARKS AND FLAMES OF GOLD WITH THE SPRING CAME THE OUT DOOR SPORTS OF THE SEASON AMONG OTHERS THAT OF BALL
2182-150130-0023 FOR BOYS WERE BOYS AND PLAYED AT BALL EVEN IN THOSE FARAWAY DAYS A GAME CALLED TRAP BALL EVEN YET IN SOME PARTS OF ENGLAND IT IS PLAYED JUST AS IT WAS IN MYLES FALWORTH'S DAY AND ENJOYED JUST AS MYLES AND HIS FRIENDS ENJOYED IT
2182-150130-0024 SO NOW THAT THE SUN WAS WARM AND THE WEATHER PLEASANT THE GAME OF TRAP BALL WAS IN FULL SWING EVERY AFTERNOON THE PLAY GROUND BEING AN OPEN SPACE BETWEEN THE WALL THAT SURROUNDED THE CASTLE GROUNDS AND THAT OF THE PRIVY GARDEN
2182-150130-0025 MYLES HIMSELF WAS AT THE TRAP BAREHANDED AND BAREARMED THE WIND WAS BLOWING FROM BEHIND HIM AND AIDED PERHAPS BY IT HE HAD ALREADY STRUCK THREE OF FOUR BALLS NEARLY THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE COURT AN UNUSUAL DISTANCE
2182-150130-0026 AND SEVERAL OF THE LADS HAD GONE BACK ALMOST AS FAR AS THE WALL OF THE PRIVY GARDEN TO CATCH ANY BALL THAT MIGHT CHANCE TO FLY AS FAR AS THAT THEN ONCE MORE MYLES STRUCK THROWING ALL HIS STRENGTH INTO THE BLOW THE BALL SHOT UP INTO THE AIR
2182-150130-0027 AND WHEN IT FELL IT WAS TO DROP WITHIN THE PRIVY GARDEN THE SHOUTS OF THE YOUNG PLAYERS WERE INSTANTLY STILLED AND GASCOYNE WHO STOOD NEAREST MYLES THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS BELT GIVING A LONG SHRILL WHISTLE
2182-150130-0028 THERE BE NO MORE PLAY FOR US UNTIL WE GET ANOTHER BALL THE OUTFIELDERS CAME SLOWLY TROOPING IN UNTIL THEY HAD GATHERED IN A LITTLE CIRCLE AROUND MYLES I COULD NOT HELP IT SAID MYLES IN ANSWER TO THEIR GRUMBLING HOW KNEW I THE BALL WOULD FLY SO FAR
2182-150130-0029 WOULDST GET THYSELF SHOT WITH A BOLT BETWIXT THE RIBS LIKE POOR DICCON COOK OF ALL PLACES ABOUT THE CASTLE THE PRIVY GARDEN WAS PERHAPS THE MOST SACRED IT WAS A SMALL PLOT OF GROUND ONLY A FEW RODS LONG AND WIDE
2182-150130-0030 AND WAS KEPT ABSOLUTELY PRIVATE FOR THE USE OF THE COUNTESS AND HER FAMILY ONLY A LITTLE WHILE BEFORE MYLES HAD FIRST COME TO DEVLEN ONE OF THE COOK'S MEN HAD BEEN FOUND CLIMBING THE WALL WHEREUPON THE SOLDIER WHO SAW HIM SHOT HIM WITH HIS CROSS BOW
2182-150130-0031 THE POOR FELLOW DROPPED FROM THE WALL INTO THE GARDEN AND WHEN THEY FOUND HIM HE STILL HELD A BUNCH OF FLOWERS IN HIS HAND WHICH HE HAD PERHAPS BEEN GATHERING FOR HIS SWEETHEART HAD MYLES SEEN HIM CARRIED ON A LITTER TO THE INFIRMARY AS GASCOYNE AND SOME OF THE OTHERS HAD DONE
2182-150130-0032 HE MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT TWICE BEFORE VENTURING TO ENTER THE LADIES PRIVATE GARDEN AS IT WAS HE ONLY SHOOK HIS STUBBORN HEAD AND SAID AGAIN I WILL CLIMB THE WALL AND FETCH IT
2182-150130-0033 NOW AT THE LOWER EXTREMITY OF THE COURT AND ABOUT TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FEET DISTANT FROM THE GARDEN WALL THERE GREW A PEAR TREE SOME OF THE BRANCHES OF WHICH OVERHUNG INTO THE GARDEN BEYOND SO FIRST MAKING SURE THAT NO ONE WAS LOOKING THAT WAY
2182-150130-0034 AND BIDDING THE OTHERS KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT MYLES SHINNED UP THIS TREE AND CHOOSING ONE OF THE THICKER LIMBS CLIMBED OUT UPON IT FOR SOME LITTLE DISTANCE THEN LOWERING HIS BODY HE HUNG AT ARM'S LENGTH THE BRANCH BENDING WITH HIS WEIGHT AND SLOWLY LET HIMSELF DOWN
2182-150130-0035 HAND UNDER HAND UNTIL AT LAST HE HUNG DIRECTLY OVER THE TOP OF THE WALL AND PERHAPS A FOOT ABOVE IT BELOW HIM HE COULD SEE THE LEAFY TOP OF AN ARBOR COVERED WITH A THICK GROWTH OF CLEMATIS AND EVEN AS HE HUNG THERE
2182-150130-0036 HE NOTICED THE BROAD SMOOTH WALKS THE GRASSY TERRACE IN FRONT OF THE COUNTESS'S APARTMENTS IN THE DISTANCE THE QUAINT FLOWER BEDS THE YEW TREES TRIMMED INTO ODD SHAPES AND EVEN THE DEAF OLD GARDENER WORKING BARE ARMED IN THE SUNLIGHT AT A FLOWER BED IN THE FAR CORNER BY THE TOOL HOUSE
2182-150130-0037 THE TOP OF THE WALL WAS POINTED LIKE A HOUSE ROOF AND IMMEDIATELY BELOW HIM WAS COVERED BY A THICK GROWTH OF GREEN MOSS AND IT FLASHED THROUGH HIS MIND AS HE HUNG THERE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD OFFER A VERY SLIPPERY FOOTHOLD FOR ONE DROPPING UPON THE STEEP SLOPES OF THE TOP
2182-150130-0038 BUT IT WAS TOO LATE TO DRAW BACK NOW BRACING HIMSELF FOR A MOMENT HE LOOSED HIS HOLD UPON THE LIMB ABOVE THE BRANCH FLEW BACK WITH A RUSH AND HE DROPPED STRIVING TO GRASP THE SLOPING ANGLE WITH HIS FEET
2182-150130-0039 FLEW THROUGH HIS BRAIN LIKE A CLOUD OF FLIES AND THEN A LEAFY GREENNESS SEEMED TO STRIKE UP AGAINST HIM A SPLINTERING CRASH SOUNDED IN HIS EARS AS THE LATTICE TOP OF THE ARBOR BROKE UNDER HIM AND WITH ONE FINAL CLUTCH AT THE EMPTY AIR HE FELL HEAVILY UPON THE GROUND BENEATH
2182-181173-0000 BUT AT LEAST HE UNDERSTOOD AFTER A FEW CONVERSATIONS WITH MISTER HAVISHAM THAT HE COULD GRATIFY ALL HIS NEAREST WISHES AND HE PROCEEDED TO GRATIFY THEM WITH A SIMPLICITY AND DELIGHT WHICH CAUSED MISTER HAVISHAM MUCH DIVERSION
2182-181173-0001 IN THE WEEK BEFORE THEY SAILED FOR ENGLAND HE DID MANY CURIOUS THINGS THE LAWYER LONG AFTER REMEMBERED THE MORNING THEY WENT DOWN TOWN TOGETHER TO PAY A VISIT TO DICK
2182-181173-0002 AND THE AFTERNOON THEY SO AMAZED THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE BY STOPPING BEFORE HER STALL AND TELLING HER SHE WAS TO HAVE A TENT AND A STOVE AND A SHAWL AND A SUM OF MONEY WHICH SEEMED TO HER QUITE WONDERFUL
2182-181173-0003 SO I THINK I DON'T KNOW HOW PAINFUL A PERSON'S BONES CAN BE BUT I'VE SYMPATHIZED WITH YOU A GREAT DEAL AND I HOPE YOU'LL BE BETTER SHE'S A VERY GOOD APPLE WOMAN HE SAID TO MISTER HAVISHAM AS THEY WALKED AWAY
2182-181173-0004 LEAVING THE PROPRIETRESS OF THE STALL ALMOST GASPING FOR BREATH AND NOT AT ALL BELIEVING IN HER GREAT FORTUNE ONCE WHEN I FELL DOWN AND CUT MY KNEE SHE GAVE ME AN APPLE FOR NOTHING I'VE ALWAYS REMEMBERED HER FOR IT YOU KNOW
2182-181173-0005 YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER PEOPLE WHO ARE KIND TO YOU IT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO HIS HONEST SIMPLE LITTLE MIND THAT THERE WERE PEOPLE WHO COULD FORGET KINDNESSES THE INTERVIEW WITH DICK WAS QUITE EXCITING
2182-181173-0006 DICK HAD JUST BEEN HAVING A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH JAKE AND WAS IN LOW SPIRITS WHEN THEY SAW HIM HIS AMAZEMENT WHEN CEDRIC CALMLY ANNOUNCED THAT THEY HAD COME TO GIVE HIM WHAT SEEMED A VERY GREAT THING TO HIM AND WOULD SET ALL HIS TROUBLES RIGHT
2182-181173-0007 THE STATEMENT THAT HIS OLD FRIEND HAD BECOME A LORD AND WAS IN DANGER OF BEING AN EARL IF HE LIVED LONG ENOUGH CAUSED DICK TO SO OPEN HIS EYES AND MOUTH AND START THAT HIS CAP FELL OFF WHEN HE PICKED IT UP HE UTTERED A RATHER SINGULAR EXCLAMATION
2182-181173-0008 MISTER HOBBS THOUGHT I'D HAD A SUNSTROKE I DIDN'T THINK I WAS GOING TO LIKE IT MYSELF BUT I LIKE IT BETTER NOW I'M USED TO IT THE ONE WHO IS THE EARL NOW HE'S MY GRANDPAPA AND HE WANTS ME TO DO ANYTHING I LIKE
2182-181173-0009 HE'S VERY KIND IF HE IS AN EARL AND HE SENT ME A LOT OF MONEY BY MISTER HAVISHAM AND I'VE BROUGHT SOME TO YOU TO BUY JAKE OUT
2182-181173-0010 AND FOUND HIMSELF THE POSSESSOR OF THE BUSINESS AND SOME NEW BRUSHES AND A MOST ASTONISHING SIGN AND OUTFIT HE COULD NOT BELIEVE IN HIS GOOD LUCK ANY MORE EASILY THAN THE APPLE WOMAN OF ANCIENT LINEAGE COULD BELIEVE IN HERS
2182-181173-0011 HE WALKED ABOUT LIKE A BOOT BLACK IN A DREAM HE STARED AT HIS YOUNG BENEFACTOR AND FELT AS IF HE MIGHT WAKE UP AT ANY MOMENT HE SCARCELY SEEMED TO REALIZE ANYTHING UNTIL CEDRIC PUT OUT HIS HAND TO SHAKE HANDS WITH HIM BEFORE GOING AWAY
2182-181173-0012 WELL GOOD BYE HE SAID AND THOUGH HE TRIED TO SPEAK STEADILY THERE WAS A LITTLE TREMBLE IN HIS VOICE AND HE WINKED HIS BIG BROWN EYES AND I HOPE TRADE'LL BE GOOD I'M SORRY I'M GOING AWAY TO LEAVE YOU
2182-181173-0013 BUT PERHAPS I SHALL COME BACK AGAIN WHEN I'M AN EARL AND I WISH YOU'D WRITE TO ME BECAUSE WE WERE ALWAYS GOOD FRIENDS AND IF YOU WRITE TO ME HERE'S WHERE YOU MUST SEND YOUR LETTER AND HE GAVE HIM A SLIP OF PAPER
2182-181173-0014 AND HE WOULD HAVE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT HE FELT JUST THEN IF HE HAD TRIED PERHAPS THAT WAS WHY HE DIDN'T TRY AND ONLY WINKED HIS EYES AND SWALLOWED A LUMP IN HIS THROAT I WISH YE WASN'T GOIN AWAY HE SAID IN A HUSKY VOICE
2182-181173-0015 THEN HE WINKED HIS EYES AGAIN THEN HE LOOKED AT MISTER HAVISHAM AND TOUCHED HIS CAP THANKY SIR FUR BRINGIN HIM DOWN HERE AN FUR WOT YE'VE DONE HE'S HE'S A QUEER LITTLE FELLER HE ADDED I'VE ALLERS THORT A HEAP OF HIM
2182-181173-0016 HE'S SUCH A GAME LITTLE FELLER AN' AN SUCH A QUEER LITTLE UN AND WHEN THEY TURNED AWAY HE STOOD AND LOOKED AFTER THEM IN A DAZED KIND OF WAY AND THERE WAS STILL A MIST IN HIS EYES AND A LUMP IN HIS THROAT
2182-181173-0017 AS HE WATCHED THE GALLANT LITTLE FIGURE MARCHING GAYLY ALONG BY THE SIDE OF ITS TALL RIGID ESCORT UNTIL THE DAY OF HIS DEPARTURE HIS LORDSHIP SPENT AS MUCH TIME AS POSSIBLE WITH MISTER HOBBS IN THE STORE
2182-181173-0018 GLOOM HAD SETTLED UPON MISTER HOBBS HE WAS MUCH DEPRESSED IN SPIRITS WHEN HIS YOUNG FRIEND BROUGHT TO HIM IN TRIUMPH THE PARTING GIFT OF A GOLD WATCH AND CHAIN MISTER HOBBS FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT PROPERLY
2182-181173-0019 HE LAID THE CASE ON HIS STOUT KNEE AND BLEW HIS NOSE VIOLENTLY SEVERAL TIMES THERE'S SOMETHING WRITTEN ON IT SAID CEDRIC INSIDE THE CASE I TOLD THE MAN MYSELF WHAT TO SAY
2182-181173-0020 FROM HIS OLDEST FRIEND LORD FAUNTLEROY TO MISTER HOBBS WHEN THIS YOU SEE REMEMBER ME I DON'T WANT YOU TO FORGET ME MISTER HOBBS BLEW HIS NOSE VERY LOUDLY AGAIN
2182-181173-0021 I SHA'N'T FORGET YOU HE SAID SPEAKING A TRIFLE HUSKILY AS DICK HAD SPOKEN NOR DON'T YOU GO AND FORGET ME WHEN YOU GET AMONG THE BRITISH ARRYSTOCRACY
2182-181173-0022 I SHOULDN'T FORGET YOU WHOEVER I WAS AMONG ANSWERED HIS LORDSHIP I'VE SPENT MY HAPPIEST HOURS WITH YOU AT LEAST SOME OF MY HAPPIEST HOURS I HOPE YOU'LL COME TO SEE ME SOMETIME
2182-181173-0023 I'D COME TO SEE YOU REPLIED MISTER HOBBS GRACIOUSLY SO IT SEEMED TO BE AGREED THAT IF HE RECEIVED A PRESSING INVITATION FROM THE EARL TO COME AND SPEND A FEW MONTHS AT DORINCOURT CASTLE
2182-181173-0024 WHEN THE CARRIAGE STOOD AT THE DOOR THEN A CURIOUS FEELING OF LONELINESS CAME UPON THE LITTLE BOY HIS MAMMA HAD BEEN SHUT UP IN HER ROOM FOR SOME TIME WHEN SHE CAME DOWN THE STAIRS HER EYES LOOKED LARGE AND WET AND HER SWEET MOUTH WAS TREMBLING
2182-181173-0025 CEDRIC WENT TO HER AND SHE BENT DOWN TO HIM AND HE PUT HIS ARMS AROUND HER AND THEY KISSED EACH OTHER HE KNEW SOMETHING MADE THEM BOTH SORRY THOUGH HE SCARCELY KNEW WHAT IT WAS BUT ONE TENDER LITTLE THOUGHT ROSE TO HIS LIPS
2182-181173-0026 WE LIKED THIS LITTLE HOUSE DEAREST DIDN'T WE HE SAID WE ALWAYS WILL LIKE IT WON'T WE YES YES SHE ANSWERED IN A LOW SWEET VOICE YES DARLING
2182-181173-0027 IT SEEMED ALMOST DIRECTLY THEY WERE ON THE STEAMER IN THE MIDST OF THE WILDEST BUSTLE AND CONFUSION CARRIAGES WERE DRIVING DOWN AND LEAVING PASSENGERS PASSENGERS WERE GETTING INTO A STATE OF EXCITEMENT ABOUT BAGGAGE WHICH HAD NOT ARRIVED AND THREATENED TO BE TOO LATE
2182-181173-0028 BIG TRUNKS AND CASES WERE BEING BUMPED DOWN AND DRAGGED ABOUT SAILORS WERE UNCOILING ROPES AND HURRYING TO AND FRO OFFICERS WERE GIVING ORDERS LADIES AND GENTLEMEN AND CHILDREN AND NURSES WERE COMING ON BOARD
2182-181173-0029 HE LOOKED AT THE PILES OF ROPE AT THE FURLED SAILS AT THE TALL TALL MASTS WHICH SEEMED ALMOST TO TOUCH THE HOT BLUE SKY HE BEGAN TO MAKE PLANS FOR CONVERSING WITH THE SAILORS AND GAINING SOME INFORMATION ON THE SUBJECT OF PIRATES
2182-181173-0030 IT WAS JUST AT THE VERY LAST WHEN HE WAS STANDING LEANING ON THE RAILING OF THE UPPER DECK AND WATCHING THE FINAL PREPARATIONS ENJOYING THE EXCITEMENT AND THE SHOUTS OF THE SAILORS AND WHARFMEN
2182-181173-0031 HE CAME UP TO CEDRIC QUITE BREATHLESS I'VE RUN ALL THE WAY HE SAID I'VE COME DOWN TO SEE YE OFF TRADE'S BEEN PRIME
2182-181173-0032 YE KIN WEAR IT WHEN YE GET AMONG THE SWELLS I LOST THE PAPER WHEN I WAS TRYIN TO GET THROUGH THEM FELLERS DOWNSTAIRS
2182-181173-0033 IT'S A HANKERCHER HE POURED IT ALL FORTH AS IF IN ONE SENTENCE A BELL RANG AND HE MADE A LEAP AWAY BEFORE CEDRIC HAD TIME TO SPEAK GOOD BYE HE PANTED WEAR IT WHEN YE GET AMONG THE SWELLS AND HE DARTED OFF AND WAS GONE
2182-181173-0034 A FEW SECONDS LATER THEY SAW HIM STRUGGLE THROUGH THE CROWD ON THE LOWER DECK AND RUSH ON SHORE JUST BEFORE THE GANG PLANK WAS DRAWN IN HE STOOD ON THE WHARF AND WAVED HIS CAP CEDRIC HELD THE HANDKERCHIEF IN HIS HAND
2182-181173-0035 IT WAS OF BRIGHT RED SILK ORNAMENTED WITH PURPLE HORSESHOES AND HORSES HEADS THERE WAS A GREAT STRAINING AND CREAKING AND CONFUSION THE PEOPLE ON THE WHARF BEGAN TO SHOUT TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THE PEOPLE ON THE STEAMER SHOUTED BACK
2182-181173-0036 EVERY ONE SEEMED TO BE SAYING DON'T FORGET US WRITE WHEN YOU GET TO LIVERPOOL GOOD BYE GOOD BYE LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY LEANED FORWARD AND WAVED THE RED HANDKERCHIEF
2182-181173-0037 AND HE HEARD NOTHING BUT THE HEARTY CHILDISH VOICE CALLING
2182-181183-0000 OF COURSE AS SOON AS THE STORY OF LORD FAUNTLEROY AND THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WERE DISCUSSED IN THE ENGLISH NEWSPAPERS THEY WERE DISCUSSED IN THE AMERICAN NEWSPAPERS THE STORY WAS TOO INTERESTING TO BE PASSED OVER LIGHTLY
2182-181183-0001 ONE SAID HE WAS ENGAGED TO A YOUNG LADY OF GREAT BEAUTY WHO WAS THE DAUGHTER OF A DUKE ANOTHER SAID HE HAD JUST BEEN MARRIED THE ONLY THING IN FACT WHICH WAS NOT SAID WAS THAT HE WAS A LITTLE BOY BETWEEN SEVEN AND EIGHT
2182-181183-0002 WITH HANDSOME LEGS AND CURLY HAIR ONE SAID HE WAS NO RELATION TO THE EARL OF DORINCOURT AT ALL BUT WAS A SMALL IMPOSTOR WHO HAD SOLD NEWSPAPERS AND SLEPT IN THE STREETS OF NEW YORK BEFORE HIS MOTHER IMPOSED UPON THE FAMILY LAWYER
2182-181183-0003 WHO CAME TO AMERICA TO LOOK FOR THE EARL'S HEIR THEN CAME THE DESCRIPTIONS OF THE NEW LORD FAUNTLEROY AND HIS MOTHER SOMETIMES SHE WAS A GYPSY SOMETIMES AN ACTRESS SOMETIMES A BEAUTIFUL SPANIARD
2182-181183-0004 BUT IT WAS ALWAYS AGREED THAT THE EARL OF DORINCOURT WAS HER DEADLY ENEMY AND WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE HER SON AS HIS HEIR IF HE COULD HELP IT AND AS THERE SEEMED TO BE SOME SLIGHT FLAW IN THE PAPERS SHE HAD PRODUCED
2182-181183-0005 IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THERE WOULD BE A LONG TRIAL WHICH WOULD BE FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN ANYTHING EVER CARRIED INTO COURT BEFORE MISTER HOBBS USED TO READ THE PAPERS UNTIL HIS HEAD WAS IN A WHIRL AND IN THE EVENING HE AND DICK WOULD TALK IT ALL OVER
2182-181183-0006 THE MORE EXCITED THEY BECAME SEEMS LIKE SOMETHIN ORTER BE DONE SAID MISTER HOBBS THINGS LIKE THEM ORTER BE HELD ON TO EARLS OR NO EARLS BUT THERE REALLY WAS NOTHING THEY COULD DO
2182-181183-0007 BUT EACH WRITE A LETTER TO CEDRIC CONTAINING ASSURANCES OF THEIR FRIENDSHIP AND SYMPATHY THEY WROTE THOSE LETTERS AS SOON AS THEY COULD AFTER RECEIVING THE NEWS AND AFTER HAVING WRITTEN THEM THEY HANDED THEM OVER TO EACH OTHER TO BE READ
2182-181183-0008 THIS IS WHAT MISTER HOBBS READ IN DICK'S LETTER DERE FREND

2182-181183-0016 SILAS HOBBS WELL SAID MISTER HOBBS HE'S PERVIDED FOR BETWEEN US IF HE AINT A EARL SO HE IS SAID DICK I'D HA STOOD BY HIM BLEST IF I DIDN'T LIKE THAT LITTLE FELLER FUST RATE
2182-181183-0017 THE VERY NEXT MORNING ONE OF DICK'S CUSTOMERS WAS RATHER SURPRISED HE WAS A YOUNG LAWYER JUST BEGINNING PRACTICE AS POOR AS A VERY YOUNG LAWYER CAN POSSIBLY BE
2182-181183-0018 BUT A BRIGHT ENERGETIC YOUNG FELLOW WITH SHARP WIT AND A GOOD TEMPER HE HAD A SHABBY OFFICE NEAR DICK'S STAND AND EVERY MORNING DICK BLACKED HIS BOOTS FOR HIM AND QUITE OFTEN THEY WERE NOT EXACTLY WATER TIGHT BUT HE ALWAYS HAD A FRIENDLY WORD OR A JOKE FOR DICK
2182-181183-0019 AND DICK WAS STARING AT ONE OF THEM WITH HIS EYES AND MOUTH OPEN AND HIS SHARP FACE ALMOST PALE WITH EXCITEMENT WHAT'S TO PAY DICK SAID THE YOUNG MAN WHAT HAS PARALYZED YOU DICK REALLY DID LOOK AS IF SOMETHING TREMENDOUS HAD HAPPENED
2182-181183-0020 MY I KNOW HER BETTER N I KNOW YOU THE YOUNG MAN BEGAN TO LAUGH WHERE DID YOU MEET HER DICK HE SAID AT NEWPORT OR WHEN YOU RAN OVER TO PARIS THE LAST TIME DICK ACTUALLY FORGOT TO GRIN
2182-181183-0021 HE BEGAN TO GATHER HIS BRUSHES AND THINGS TOGETHER AS IF HE HAD SOMETHING TO DO WHICH WOULD PUT AN END TO HIS BUSINESS FOR THE PRESENT NEVER MIND HE SAID I KNOW HER AN I'VE STRUCK WORK FOR THIS MORNIN
2182-181183-0022 MISTER HOBBS COULD SCARCELY BELIEVE THE EVIDENCE OF HIS SENSES WHEN HE LOOKED ACROSS THE COUNTER AND SAW DICK RUSH IN WITH THE PAPER IN HIS HAND THE BOY WAS OUT OF BREATH WITH RUNNING SO MUCH OUT OF BREATH IN FACT THAT HE COULD SCARCELY SPEAK
2182-181183-0023 AS HE THREW THE PAPER DOWN ON THE COUNTER HELLO
2182-181183-0024 LOOK AT IT PANTED DICK
2182-181183-0025 THAT'S WHAT YOU LOOK AT SHE AINT NO RISTOCRAT SHE AINT WITH WITHERING SCORN SHE'S NO LORD'S WIFE

2182-181183-0028 PROFESSOR DICK TIPTON HAD ALWAYS BEEN A SHARP BOY AND EARNING HIS LIVING IN THE STREETS OF A BIG CITY HAD MADE HIM STILL SHARPER HE HAD LEARNED TO KEEP HIS EYES OPEN AND HIS WITS ABOUT HIM
2182-181183-0029 AND IT MUST BE CONFESSED HE ENJOYED IMMENSELY THE EXCITEMENT AND IMPATIENCE OF THAT MOMENT IF LITTLE LORD FAUNTLEROY COULD ONLY HAVE LOOKED INTO THE STORE THAT MORNING HE WOULD CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN INTERESTED
2182-181183-0030 THE FELLER THAT GIVE ME THE PAPER HE'S A LAWYER LET'S AX HIM WHAT WE'D BETTER DO LAWYERS KNOWS IT ALL MISTER HOBBS WAS IMMENSELY IMPRESSED BY THIS SUGGESTION AND DICK'S BUSINESS CAPACITY
2182-181183-0031 THAT'S SO HE REPLIED THIS HERE CALLS FOR LAWYERS AND LEAVING THE STORE IN THE CARE OF A SUBSTITUTE HE STRUGGLED INTO HIS COAT AND MARCHED DOWN TOWN WITH DICK AND THE TWO PRESENTED THEMSELVES WITH THEIR ROMANTIC STORY IN MISTER HARRISON'S OFFICE
2182-181183-0032 MUCH TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S ASTONISHMENT IF HE HAD NOT BEEN A VERY YOUNG LAWYER WITH A VERY ENTERPRISING MIND AND A GREAT DEAL OF SPARE TIME ON HIS HANDS HE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SO READILY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY
2182-181183-0033 FOR IT ALL CERTAINLY SOUNDED VERY WILD AND QUEER BUT HE CHANCED TO WANT SOMETHING TO DO VERY MUCH AND HE CHANCED TO KNOW DICK AND DICK CHANCED TO SAY HIS SAY IN A VERY SHARP TELLING SORT OF WAY
2182-181183-0034 IT APPEARS THERE HAS BEEN SOME DUBIOUSNESS ABOUT THE CHILD THE WOMAN CONTRADICTED HERSELF IN SOME OF HER STATEMENTS ABOUT HIS AGE AND AROUSED SUSPICION THE FIRST PERSONS TO BE WRITTEN TO ARE DICK'S BROTHER AND THE EARL OF DORINCOURT'S FAMILY LAWYER
2182-181183-0035 AND ACTUALLY BEFORE THE SUN WENT DOWN TWO LETTERS HAD BEEN WRITTEN AND SENT IN TWO DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS ONE SPEEDING OUT OF NEW YORK HARBOR ON A MAIL STEAMER ON ITS WAY TO ENGLAND AND THE OTHER ON A TRAIN CARRYING LETTERS AND PASSENGERS BOUND FOR CALIFORNIA
2182-181183-0036 AND THE SECOND TO BENJAMIN TIPTON
2196-170151-0000 IT OFTTIMES REQUIRES HEROIC COURAGE TO FACE FRUITLESS EFFORT TO TAKE UP THE BROKEN STRANDS OF A LIFE WORK TO LOOK BRAVELY TOWARD THE FUTURE AND PROCEED UNDAUNTED ON OUR WAY
2196-170151-0001 BUT WHAT TO OUR EYES MAY SEEM HOPELESS FAILURE IS OFTEN BUT THE DAWNING OF A GREATER SUCCESS IT MAY CONTAIN IN ITS DEBRIS THE FOUNDATION MATERIAL OF A MIGHTY PURPOSE OR THE REVELATION OF NEW AND HIGHER POSSIBILITIES
2196-170151-0002 SOME YEARS AGO IT WAS PROPOSED TO SEND LOGS FROM CANADA TO NEW YORK BY A NEW METHOD THE INGENIOUS PLAN OF MISTER JOGGINS WAS TO BIND GREAT LOGS TOGETHER BY CABLES AND IRON GIRDERS
2196-170151-0003 AND THE ANGRY WATERS SCATTERED THE LOGS FAR AND WIDE THE CHIEF OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT AT WASHINGTON HEARD OF THE FAILURE OF THE EXPERIMENT AND AT ONCE SENT WORD TO SHIPMASTERS THE WORLD OVER
2196-170151-0004 URGING THEM TO WATCH CAREFULLY FOR THESE LOGS WHICH HE DESCRIBED AND TO NOTE THE PRECISE LOCATION OF EACH IN LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE AND THE TIME THE OBSERVATION WAS MADE HUNDREDS OF CAPTAINS SAILING OVER THE WATERS OF THE EARTH
2196-170151-0005 NOTED THE LOGS IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE SOUTH SEAS FOR INTO ALL WATERS DID THESE VENTURESOME ONES TRAVEL HUNDREDS OF REPORTS WERE MADE COVERING A PERIOD OF WEEKS AND MONTHS
2196-170151-0006 THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE THEN CAREFULLY COLLATED SYSTEMATIZED AND TABULATED AND DISCOVERIES WERE MADE AS TO THE COURSE OF OCEAN CURRENTS THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE THE LOSS OF THE JOGGINS RAFT WAS NOT A REAL FAILURE
2196-170151-0007 FOR IT LED TO ONE OF THE GREAT DISCOVERIES IN MODERN MARINE GEOGRAPHY AND NAVIGATION IN OUR SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE WE ARE DISPOSED TO SPEAK IN A PATRONIZING TONE
2196-170151-0008 BUT THEIR FAILURE TO TRANSMUTE THE BASER METALS INTO GOLD RESULTED IN THE BIRTH OF CHEMISTRY THEY DID NOT SUCCEED IN WHAT THEY ATTEMPTED BUT THEY BROUGHT INTO VOGUE THE NATURAL PROCESSES OF SUBLIMATION FILTRATION
2196-170151-0009 DISTILLATION AND CRYSTALLIZATION THEY INVENTED THE ALEMBIC THE RETORT THE SAND BATH THE WATER BATH AND OTHER VALUABLE INSTRUMENTS TO THEM IS DUE THE DISCOVERY OF ANTIMONY SULPHURIC ETHER AND PHOSPHORUS
2196-170151-0010 AND ITS USE IN GUNPOWDER AND THE DISCOVERY OF THE DISTILLATION OF ESSENTIAL OILS THIS WAS THE SUCCESS OF FAILURE A WONDROUS PROCESS OF NATURE FOR THE HIGHEST GROWTH A MIGHTY LESSON OF COMFORT STRENGTH AND ENCOURAGEMENT
2196-170151-0011 IN DISCOVERING AMERICA COLUMBUS FAILED ABSOLUTELY HIS INGENIOUS REASONING AND EXPERIMENT LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT BY SAILING WESTWARD HE WOULD REACH INDIA EVERY REDMAN IN AMERICA CARRIES IN HIS NAME INDIAN
2196-170151-0012 THE PERPETUATION OF THE MEMORY OF THE FAILURE OF COLUMBUS THE GENOESE NAVIGATOR DID NOT REACH INDIA THE CARGO OF SOUVENIRS HE TOOK BACK TO SPAIN TO SHOW TO FERDINAND AND ISABELLA AS PROOFS OF HIS SUCCESS
2196-170151-0013 REALLY ATTESTED HIS FAILURE BUT THE DISCOVERY OF AMERICA WAS A GREATER SUCCESS THAN WAS ANY FINDING OF A BACK DOOR TO INDIA WHEN DAVID LIVINGSTONE HAD SUPPLEMENTED HIS THEOLOGICAL EDUCATION BY A MEDICAL COURSE
2196-170151-0014 OPENED A WHOLE CONTINENT TO LIGHT AND TRUTH HIS STUDY PROVED AN IDEAL PREPARATION FOR HIS LABORS AS PHYSICIAN EXPLORER TEACHER AND EVANGEL IN THE WILDS OF AFRICA
2196-170151-0015 BUSINESS REVERSES AND THE FAILURE OF HIS PARTNER THREW UPON THE BROAD SHOULDERS AND THE STILL BROADER HONOR AND HONESTY OF SIR WALTER SCOTT A BURDEN OF RESPONSIBILITY THAT FORCED HIM TO WRITE
2196-170151-0016 HIS BRUSH STROKES PUT ON IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS BEFORE GOING TO HIS MENIAL DUTIES AS A RAILWAY PORTER IN THE DUSK LIKE THAT PERPETUATED ON HIS CANVAS MEANT STRENGTH FOOD AND MEDICINE FOR THE DYING WIFE HE ADORED
2196-170151-0017 THE ART FAILURE THAT CAST HIM INTO THE DEPTHS OF POVERTY UNIFIED WITH MARVELLOUS INTENSITY ALL THE FINER ELEMENTS OF HIS NATURE THIS RARE SPIRITUAL UNITY
2196-170151-0018 THIS PURGING OF ALL THE DROSS OF TRIVIALITY AS HE PASSED THROUGH THE FURNACE OF POVERTY TRIAL AND SORROW GAVE ELOQUENCE TO HIS BRUSH AND ENABLED HIM TO PAINT AS NEVER BEFORE AS NO PROSPERITY WOULD HAVE MADE POSSIBLE
2196-170151-0019 FAILURE IS OFTEN THE TURNING POINT THE PIVOT OF CIRCUMSTANCE THAT SWINGS US TO HIGHER LEVELS IT MAY NOT BE FINANCIAL SUCCESS IT MAY NOT BE FAME IT MAY BE NEW DRAUGHTS OF SPIRITUAL MORAL OR MENTAL INSPIRATION
2196-170151-0020 THERE IS BUT ONE QUESTION FOR HIM TO ANSWER TO FACE BOLDLY AND HONESTLY AS AN INDIVIDUAL ALONE WITH HIS CONSCIENCE AND HIS DESTINY HOW WILL I LET THAT POVERTY OR WEALTH AFFECT ME IF THAT TRIAL OR DEPRIVATION HAS LEFT ME BETTER
2196-170151-0021 TRUER NOBLER THEN POVERTY HAS BEEN RICHES FAILURE HAS BEEN A SUCCESS IF WEALTH HAS COME TO ME AND HAS MADE ME VAIN ARROGANT CONTEMPTUOUS UNCHARITABLE CYNICAL
2196-170151-0022 IT HAS NOT BEEN RICHES IT HAS BEEN DARK TREACHEROUS POVERTY THAT STOLE FROM ME EVEN MYSELF ALL THINGS BECOME FOR US THEN WHAT WE TAKE FROM THEM FAILURE IS ONE OF GOD'S EDUCATORS
2196-170151-0023 IT IS EXPERIENCE LEADING MAN TO HIGHER THINGS IT IS THE REVELATION OF A WAY A PATH HITHERTO UNKNOWN TO US THE BEST MEN IN THE WORLD THOSE WHO HAVE MADE THE GREATEST REAL SUCCESSES
2196-170151-0024 LOOK BACK WITH SERENE HAPPINESS ON THEIR FAILURES THE TURNING OF THE FACE OF TIME SHOWS ALL THINGS IN A WONDROUSLY ILLUMINATED AND SATISFYING PERSPECTIVE MANY A MAN IS THANKFUL TO DAY THAT SOME PETTY SUCCESS FOR WHICH HE ONCE STRUGGLED
2196-170151-0025 MELTED INTO THIN AIR AS HIS HAND SOUGHT TO CLUTCH IT FAILURE IS OFTEN THE ROCK BOTTOM FOUNDATION OF REAL SUCCESS IF MAN IN A FEW INSTANCES OF HIS LIFE CAN SAY
2196-170151-0026 THE DEATH OR DESTRUCTION OF THE SEED IS THE PRELUDE TO ITS RESURRECTION AS WHEAT IT IS AT NIGHT IN THE DARKEST HOURS THOSE PRECEDING DAWN THAT PLANTS GROW BEST THAT THEY MOST INCREASE IN SIZE
2196-170151-0027 MAY THIS NOT BE ONE OF NATURE'S GENTLE SHOWINGS TO MAN OF THE TIMES WHEN HE GROWS BEST OF THE DARKNESS OF FAILURE THAT IS EVOLVING INTO THE SUNLIGHT OF SUCCESS LET US FEAR ONLY THE FAILURE OF NOT LIVING THE RIGHT AS WE SEE IT
2196-170151-0028 LEAVING THE RESULTS TO THE GUARDIANSHIP OF THE INFINITE IF WE THINK OF ANY SUPREME MOMENT OF OUR LIVES ANY GREAT SUCCESS ANY ONE WHO IS DEAR TO US AND THEN CONSIDER HOW WE REACHED THAT MOMENT THAT SUCCESS
2196-170151-0029 WE WILL SEE HOW LOGICAL HAS BEEN THE COURSE OF OUR JOY AND SUCCESS FROM SORROW AND FAILURE AND THAT WHAT GIVES US MOST HAPPINESS TO DAY IS INEXTRICABLY CONNECTED WITH WHAT ONCE CAUSED US SORROW
2196-170151-0030 HAVE HAD THEIR SOURCE AND THEIR TRICKLING INCREASE INTO VOLUME AMONG THE DARK GLOOMY RECESSES OF OUR FAILURE THERE IS NO HONEST AND TRUE WORK
2196-170151-0031 IN CONTINUOUS HARMONY WITH THEM
2196-170151-0032 NO MATTER WHAT STATISTICS OF FAILURE A NEAR SIGHTED AND HALF BLIND WORLD OF CRITICS AND COMMENTATORS MAY LAY AT HIS DOOR HIGH IDEALS NOBLE EFFORTS WILL MAKE SEEMING FAILURES BUT TRIFLES
2196-170151-0033 THEY NEED NOT DISHEARTEN US THEY SHOULD PROVE SOURCES OF NEW STRENGTH THE ROCKY WAY MAY PROVE SAFER THAN THE SLIPPERY PATH OF SMOOTHNESS BIRDS CANNOT FLY BEST WITH THE WIND BUT AGAINST IT SHIPS DO NOT PROGRESS IN CALM
2196-170151-0034 WHEN THE SAILS FLAP IDLY AGAINST THE UNSTRAINED MASTS
2196-170379-0000 IS TO EXPLORE VARIOUS VIEWS WHICH ARE HELD BY LEADING AUTHORITIES AT PRESENT IT CAN BE SAID HOWEVER THAT A MAJORITY OF AUTHORITIES AGREE THAT HYPNOSIS ENSUES AS A RESULT OF NATURAL LAWS
2196-170379-0001 WHICH HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED IN THE HUMAN ORGANISM SINCE THE BEGINNING OF MAN AS HE IS TODAY THE OLDER THEORIES SHOW ALMOST AS MUCH DISPARITY AS TODAY BUT FOR THE PURPOSES OF HISTORY
2196-170379-0002 BOTH NAMES LOOM LARGE IN THE HISTORY OF HYPNOSIS MESMER AN EIGHTEENTH CENTURY PHYSICIAN BELIEVED THAT HYPNOSIS OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF VITAL FLUIDS DRAWN FROM A MAGNET OR LODESTONE
2196-170379-0003 AND WHICH DREW THEIR UNIQUE QUALITIES FROM THE SUN MOON AND STARS CHARCOT
2196-170379-0004 WAS CONVINCED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A FORM OF HYSTERIA AND THAT ONLY HYSTERICS COULD BE HYPNOTIZED THE FORMER MESMER THOUGHT FURTHER THAT METAL BECAME IMBUED BY THE SOLAR QUALITIES AND HIS SYSTEM IS ALSO KNOWN AS METALOGY
2196-170379-0005 NOTABLY DOCTOR WILLIAM S KROGER A PSYCHIATRICALLY ORIENTED OBSTETRICIAN AND GYNECOLOGIST WHO LIMITS HIS PRACTICE TO HYPNOTHERAPY BELIEVE HYPNOSIS IS A CONVICTION PHENOMENON WHICH PRODUCES RESULTS THAT PARALLEL THE PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0006 PRODUCED AT LOURDES AND OTHER RELIGIOUS HEALING SHRINES HIS FORMULA IS THAT FAITH HOPE BELIEF AND EXPECTATION ALL CATALYZED BY THE IMAGINATION LEAD INEVITABLY TO HYPNOSIS
2196-170379-0007 IS CONVINCED THAT YOU CANNOT WILL YOURSELF TO BE HYPNOTIZED AND THAT WHENEVER THE WILL AND THE IMAGINATION COME INTO CONFLICT
2196-170379-0008 THIS FITS IN PERFECTLY OF COURSE WITH THE AUTHOR'S ALREADY DISCUSSED VISUAL IMAGERY TECHNIQUE WHICH REQUIRES A HIGH DEGREE OF IMAGINATION DOCTOR KROGER LIKE A FEW OTHERS HAS PROVED TO HIS OWN SATISFACTION THAT ALL HYPNOTIC PHENOMENA
2196-170379-0009 CAN BE PRODUCED AT A NON HYPNOTIC LEVEL A LARGE NUMBER OF HYPNOTISTS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR HAS COME TO BELIEVE THAT HYPNOSIS IS A SEMANTIC PROBLEM IN WHICH WORDS ARE THE BUILDING BLOCKS TO SUCCESS NOT JUST ANY WORDS
2196-170379-0010 BUT WORDS WHICH RING A BELL OR TAP THE EXPERIENTIAL BACKGROUND OF THE SUBJECT
2196-170379-0011 THE WORD IS USED BECAUSE HYPNOSIS SUPERFICIALLY RESEMBLES SLEEP INASMUCH AS THE EYES USUALLY ARE CLOSED THE BODY IN A POSTURE OF COMPLETE RELAXATION ACTUALLY THE MIND IS HYPERACUTE
2196-170379-0012 ON THE OTHER HAND WE KNOW THAT A STRONG INTERPERSONAL RELATIONSHIP IS NECESSARY FOR HYPNOSIS IN THE OPENING CHAPTER OF THE BOOK I EXPLAINED THAT HYPNOSIS WAS A STATE OF HEIGHTENED SUGGESTION IN WHICH THE SUBJECT ADOPTED AN UNCRITICAL ATTITUDE
2196-170379-0013 ALLOWING HIM TO ACCEPT SUGGESTIONS AND TO TAKE APPROPRIATE ACTION THIS IS EXCELLENT AS FAR AS IT GOES BUT IT DOES NOT EXPLAIN HOW SUGGESTION WORKS THIS IS THE CRUX OF THE HYPNOTIC DILEMMA AND THE ANSWER IS FAR FROM SOLVED
2196-170379-0014 HYPNOTISTS ARE MUCH LIKE THOSE WHO USE ELECTRICITY EVERY DAY OF THEIR LIVES BUT HAVE NO IDEA OF THE NATURE OF ELECTRICITY IT IS ENOUGH FOR THEM TO KNOW IT HAS BEEN HARNESSED FOR THEIR USE
2196-170379-0015 IF THERE IS ONE THING VIRTUALLY CERTAIN ABOUT HYPNOSIS IT IS THAT SOME PARTS OF THE BRAIN ARE INHIBITED AND OTHER PARTS EXPANDED BY THE PROCESS
2196-170379-0016 BUT WHY IS THIS HIGH ORDER OF CONCENTRATION SO EASY UNDER HYPNOSIS WHEN ASIANS NOTABLY THE CHINESE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR CENTURIES TO CONCENTRATE ON ONE SUBJECT FOR AS LONG AS FOUR OR FIVE SECONDS
2196-170379-0017 WE DO NOT KNOW THE MECHANICS OF THIS METAMORPHOSIS OF AN ORDINARY BRAIN INTO AN ORGAN OF CONCENTRATED POWER ACCORDING TO JANET THIS IS ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE FORMATION OF A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES
2196-170379-0018 WHICH TAKES OVER THE USUAL STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS TYPE OF THINKING IT IS IMPLIED THAT THE PROCESS MAY BE ATAVISTIC ONE OF THE NEWER THEORIES ONE HELD BY DOCTOR LEWIS R WOLBERG A PSYCHOANALYST
2196-170379-0019 AND A LIMITATION OF SENSORY CHANNELS SUCH AS TAKES PLACE IN SLEEP HE ALSO BELIEVES THAT THE PSYCHOLOGICAL PROCESS OPERATES THROUGH TRANSFERENCE OTHERS AGREE THAT IT IS A TRANSFERENCE PROCESS
2196-170379-0020 BUT THAT IT IS MORE OF AN EXTENSION OF THE SUBJECT'S OWN PSYCHIC PROCESSES WHICH IS ENLARGED TO INCLUDE THE VOICE OF THE HYPNOTIST OR HIS OWN THOUGHTS OR VOICE INCIDENTALLY AN EXCELLENT BOOK ALONG THESE THEORETICAL LINES IS HYPNOTISM
2196-170379-0021 ACTUALLY HYPNOTISTS TODAY
2196-170379-0022 MILTON V KLINE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHOLOGY AT LONG ISLAND UNIVERSITY POSTULATES THAT HYPNOSIS IS PRIMARILY RETROGRESSIVE HE HAS WRITTEN THAT THE ORGANISM FUNCTIONS DIFFERENTLY ON VARIOUS LEVELS OF BEHAVIOR REGRESSION
2196-170379-0023 THIS IS A LEGITIMATE USE OF REGRESSION ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT USED SO MUCH THESE DAYS TO UNCOVER PAST TRAUMATIC INCIDENTS ACTUALLY REGRESSION BY DUPLICATING THE EXACT EARLIER AGE
2196-170379-0024 MAKES US ONCE MORE AS LITTLE CHILDREN A CONDITION TO BE DESIRED FOR CERTAIN FORMS OF THERAPY AN ATAVISTIC THEORY HELD TO SOME EXTENT BY DOCTOR JEROME M SCHNECK CLINICAL ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY
2196-170379-0025 STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK COLLEGE OF MEDICINE IS THAT HYPNOSIS SHOULD BE EQUATED WITH STATES OF IMMOBILIZATION ON THE BASIS OF HIS OBSERVATION THAT SOME SUBJECTS EQUATE HYPNOSIS WITH DEATH
2196-170379-0026 OF ANIMALS TO AVOID DANGER OTHERS PRIMARILY EUROPEANS HAVE POINTED OUT THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE HYPNOTIC STATE OF ANIMALS AND MAN ANOTHER WIDELY HELD THEORY IS THAT HYPNOSIS IS A STATE OF DISSOCIATION
2196-170379-0027 MEANING THAT IT CONSTITUTES A GROUP OF UNCONSCIOUS MEMORIES AND ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE DREDGED UP TO REPLACE THE STREAM OF CONSCIOUSNESS AUTOMATICISM OF COURSE IS INHERENTLY PART OF THIS VIEW AND IS PRESUMED TO NEGATE VOLITION ACTIVITY OF THE CEREBRUM
2196-170379-0028 WHICH CONTROLS THE CONSCIOUS AND VOLUNTARY SYSTEM IS RENDERED NON OPERATIONAL MY OWN THOUGHTS ON THE MATTER ARE THAT HYPNOSIS RESULTS FROM FIRST OF ALL A GOOD TRANSFERENCE SECONDLY FROM A CONDITIONED REFLEX
2196-170379-0029 THIRDLY FROM THE PERSON ACTING AS A HYPNOTIZED PERSON ROLE PLAYING AND FOURTHLY FROM A SUSPENSION OF THE CRITICAL FACULTIES ALONG THE LAST NAMED LINE I BELIEVE THAT HYPNOTIC SUGGESTIONS
2196-170379-0030 WHICH SUPERSEDE ALL ELSE IN THE HYPNOTIC SITUATION THERE ARE MANY MORE THEORIES I BELIEVE ARE PARTIALLY CORRECT BUT THE ONES NAMED WILL DO FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS VOLUME INCIDENTALLY
2196-170379-0031 ARE EQUALLY APPLICABLE TO SELF HYPNOSIS EXCEPT WHERE AS IN TRANSFERENCE IT IS OBVIOUS A THERAPIST IS NEEDED IN CONCLUSION THE AUTHOR WOULD LIKE TO TAKE ISSUE WITH THOSE
2196-170379-0032 WHERE HYPNOTHERAPY IS IMPOSSIBLE LIKE THE MAN WHO CANNOT SLEEP BECAUSE OF AN ACTIVE MIND SLEEP AND MYRIAD THOUGHTS AND SUGGESTIONS ARE INCOMPATIBLE AND I BELIEVE ONCE A HYPNOTIC STATE HAS BEEN ATTAINED THAT THE SUBJECT IS KEPT AWAKE
2196-170379-0033 UNLESS DEFINITE SLEEP SUGGESTIONS ARE GIVEN BY THE THERAPIST'S SERIES OF SUGGESTIONS WE HAVE DISCUSSED THE EFFECT OF THE EXPERIENTIAL BACKGROUND AT LENGTH AND SURELY NOTHING CONNOTATES SLEEP MORE THAN CLOSING ONE'S EYES
2196-170379-0034 AND SO IN MY VIEW
2196-174172-0000 SUPREME CONTROL OF AGE YOUTH IS ETERNAL NATURE NEVER GROWS OLD THE FLOWERS THAT BLOOMED IN EDEN ARE BLOOMING TO DAY JUST AS LOVELY JUST AS SWEET
2196-174172-0001 JUST AS FRESH AND UNCHANGED THE ROSES YOUR LIFE MATE BRINGS HOME TO YOU HAVE THE SAME FRAGRANCE AS THE ROSES ADAM BROUGHT TO EVE IF HE THOUGHT OF IT
2196-174172-0002 WARMED MOTHER EARTH INTO VERNAL SPRING LIFE ARE THE SAME LIFE GIVING RAYS THAT SHALL BRING AGAIN THE SPRING TIDE LIFE NEVER GROWS OLD IT ONLY CHANGES FORM YOUR LIFE IS PERPETUAL
2196-174172-0003 THEN YOUR YOUTH MAY BE PERPETUAL THE HUMAN RACE IS EVER YOUNG ITS UNITS FALL OFF YOU SHOULD BE YOUNGER AT SIXTY THAN AT SIXTEEN
2196-174172-0004 GROWING OLD IS A HABIT PEOPLE TRAVEL ALONG THE YEARS UP THE HILL OF LIFE TILL THEY REACH A CERTAIN POINT WHERE THEY BEGIN TO THINK THEY MUST BE GROWING OLD THINK ITS TIME TO SAG THINK ITS TIME TO DROOP
2196-174172-0005 THINK ITS TIME TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF DECAY THEN BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT IT TO WRITE LETTERS ABOUT IT TO FEEL AROUND FOR IT TO LOOK FOR IT IN OTHERS FINALLY THE HABIT THEY INHERITED FROM THE RACE IS ON
2196-174172-0006 AND THEY ARE OLD LIFE IS ENDLESS BUT YOU CAN THINK IT SHORT THE POWER OF AN ENDLESS LIFE IS WITHIN YOU BUT BY THINKING YOU CAN TURN IT TO THE WHITE ASHES OF OLD AGE THINK YOUTH
2196-174172-0007 AND YOU STAY YOUNG YOUTH IS GROWTH KEEP GROWING AND YOU KEEP YOUNG A NEW IDEA WILL MAKE YOU FEEL YOUNGER DEVELOP IT AND IT WILL DEVELOP YOU QUICKEN YOUR MENTAL THROB WITH NEW IDEAS

2196-174172-0015 STOP POISONING YOUR BODY WITH ANGER HATE JEALOUSY FEAR KEEP YOUR MIND SWEET THINK CHEERFULLY AVOID MENTAL TURMOIL AND EXCITEMENT TWO GREAT ENEMIES OF YOUTH ARE WORRY AND FEAR
2196-174172-0016 THE NEXT IS SELFISHNESS THINK EVERY MORNING WHEN YOU RISE THIS NEW DAY IS NEW LIFE IT IS FRESH FROM THE HAND OF GOD IT IS MINE TO USE I WILL INCREASE IT UNTO THE PERFECT DAY

2196-174172-0021 LEARN TO LOVE WORK FOR THE HAPPINESS IT BRINGS PUT JOY INTO YOUR WORK IN THE MORNING AND YOU WILL FIND IT MULTIPLIED INTO HAPPINESS AT NIGHT WORK IS A LAW OF YOUTH INACTION IS DECAY
2196-174172-0022 INERTIA IS DEATH MEN AND WOMEN DO NOT USUALLY LOSE THEIR POSITIONS THEY DRIVE THEIR POSITIONS AWAY FROM THEM THE LAW OF WORK WILL NOT STAND PERSONAL ABUSE
2196-174172-0023 ANY MORE THAN THE LAW OF BEAUTY WILL ENDURE BRUTALITY FORM AN IDEAL OF YOUR WORK MAKE A MENTAL PICTURE OF IT SIMPLIFY IT ORDERLY IT BEAUTIFY IT THEN GLORIFY IT
2196-174172-0024 AND WORK WITH CONFIDENT EXPECTATION PUT RULES AND SYSTEM INTO YOUR DAILY TASK EXERCISE YOUR SELF CONTROL YOUR SELF POSSESSION SELF MASTERY MARCH UP TO YOUR TASK WITH EFFICIENCY

2196-174172-0026 LOVE IS THE FULFILLING OF THE LAW YOUTH IS SUPREME CHEERFULNESS TO BE FUNLESS IS TO BE LIFELESS GOOD CHEER IS THE TONIC OF YOUTH IF YOU ARE SO SAD YOU CANNOT LAUGH AT SOMETHING
2196-174172-0027 BATHE IN MIRTH FROLIC IN SOME SUNSHINE DAILY EVEN IF YOU LIVE IN PITTSBURGH AND HAVE TO MAKE YOUR OWN SUNSHINE MAKE FUN DON'T ALWAYS BUY IT YOU CAN CURE DISEASE AND KILL THE DEVIL WITH LAUGHTER

2196-174172-0032 LIKE A MEDICINE TO FORGET YOUR SORROW BEGIN TO CULTIVATE JOY KEEP AWAY FROM SAD PEOPLE OR YOU WILL BE SAD STOP REHEARSING YOUR GRIEF YOU ONLY ENLARGE IT IF YOU SUFFER GRIEF
2196-174172-0033 FIND SOMEONE IN TROUBLE AND CHEER THEM ENCOURAGE THEM HELP THEM AND YOU WILL DELIVER YOURSELF YOU WILL COMFORT YOURSELF WHEN YOU COMFORT ANOTHER YOU CANNOT LOSE A LOVED ONE THO ABSENT FROM THE EARTH PLANE
2196-174172-0034 THEY ARE NEARER THAN EVER LIFE AND LOVE NEVER CHANGE DEATH IS AN UNREALITY THOUGHT MADE
2196-174172-0035 THAT IS GLORIFIED IN LIFE AND SPIRIT WHEN YOU BELIEVE YOU WERE CREATED IN HIS IMAGE
2196-174172-0036 IT IS EASIER TO BELIEVE YOU SHALL ARISE IN HIS LIKENESS SOME DAY WE SHALL ALL BELIEVE WE HAVE NOT DISFIGURED MORALLY BROKEN NATURES BUT DIVINE NATURES SUPREME IN LIMITLESS POWER
2196-174172-0037 TRADITIONS TEACHINGS EDUCATION ENVIRONMENT OF GENERATIONS OF THINKING HAVE DISFIGURED MORALLY BROKEN SIN BURDENED HUMANITY ALL ARE THOUGHT CREATED CONDITIONS THOUGHT MADE LIMITATIONS
2196-174172-0038 THOUGHT MADE ORIGINAL SINS SYSTEM CULTIVATED HUMAN WRONGS INSTITUTIONALIZED TEACHINGS OF ERROR BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW THE UNIVERSE IS ONE UNDIVIDED SOUL YOU ARE A YOKE FELLOW WITH GOD
2196-174172-0039 YOU ARE A LOBE OF THE INFINITE BRAIN
2196-174172-0040 OF ABSOLUTE PERSONALITY NOTHING THAT HAS LIFE IS GOD DAMNED WHERE LOVE IS ONLY A DREAM THE MARRIAGE IS AN ALARM CLOCK IF YOU CANNOT ENDURE YOUR MOTHER IN LAW
2196-174172-0041 YOU CAN BEGIN YOUR PLANS AT ONCE TO LIVE ALONE WHEN YOUR CHILDREN ARE MARRIED A QUARREL BETWEEN TWO PEOPLE TO SETTLE THINGS IS A GOOD DEAL LIKE A DOG FIGHT IN A FLOWER BED THE ONLY THINGS THAT GET SETTLED ARE THE FLOWERS
2196-174172-0042 NEARLY ALWAYS WHEN YOU HEAR THE LUSTY WAIL OF A BOY WITH ENERGY PLUS FILLING THE AIR YOU CAN LOOK IN AT THE WINDOW AND FIND A WOMAN'S HAND AT THE SEAT OF HIS TROUBLE YOU CAN OVER WORK YOUR NOTION OF NEATNESS
226-122538-0000 CHAPTER FOURTEEN IN DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE WHITE CLIFFS OF DOVER GRADUALLY BECAME MORE SOLID AND DISTINCT UNTIL AT LENGTH THEY ROSE FROM THE SEA A STRONG WHITE WALL
226-122538-0001 EMBLEM OF THE UNDENIABLE PURITY OF ENGLAND THE STAINLESS HONOUR AND INTEGRITY OF HER THRONE HER CHURCH HER PARLIAMENT HER COURTS OF JUSTICE AND HER DEALINGS AT HOME AND ABROAD WHETHER WITH FRIEND OR FOE
226-122538-0002 STRENGTH AND WHITENESS THOUGHT JANE AS SHE PACED THE STEAMER'S DECK AND AFTER A TWO YEARS ABSENCE HER HEART WENT OUT TO HER NATIVE LAND THEN DOVER CASTLE CAUGHT HER EYE SO BEAUTIFUL IN THE PEARLY LIGHT OF THAT SPRING AFTERNOON
226-122538-0003 AN HOUR AFTER SHE HAD READ IT SHE WAS DRIVING DOWN THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD TO CAIRO EMBARKED AT ALEXANDRIA THE NEXT DAY LANDED AT BRINDISI
226-122538-0004 AND THIS NIGHT AND DAY TRAVELLING HAD BROUGHT HER AT LAST WITHIN SIGHT OF THE SHORES OF ENGLAND IN A FEW MINUTES SHE WOULD SET FOOT UPON THEM AND THEN THERE WOULD BE BUT TWO MORE STAGES TO HER JOURNEY FOR FROM THE MOMENT SHE STARTED
226-122538-0005 JANE NEVER DOUBTED HER ULTIMATE DESTINATION THE ROOM WHERE PAIN AND DARKNESS AND DESPAIR MUST BE WAGING SO TERRIBLE A CONFLICT AGAINST THE MORAL COURAGE THE MENTAL SANITY AND THE INSTINCTIVE HOLD ON LIFE OF THE MAN SHE LOVED
226-122538-0006 THAT SHE WAS GOING TO HIM JANE KNEW BUT SHE FELT UTTERLY UNABLE TO ARRANGE HOW OR IN WHAT WAY HER GOING COULD BE MANAGED THAT IT WAS A COMPLICATED PROBLEM HER COMMON SENSE TOLD HER
226-122538-0007 AND THAT HER SUREST WAY TO GARTH LAY THROUGH THE DOCTOR'S CONSULTING ROOM SO SHE TELEGRAPHED TO DERYCK FROM PARIS AND AT PRESENT HER MIND SAW NO FURTHER THAN WIMPOLE STREET AT DOVER SHE BOUGHT A PAPER
226-122538-0008 AND HASTILY SCANNED ITS PAGES AS SHE WALKED ALONG THE PLATFORM IN THE WAKE OF THE CAPABLE PORTER WHO HAD TAKEN POSSESSION OF HER RUGS AND HAND BAGGAGE IN THE PERSONAL COLUMN SHE FOUND THE VERY PARAGRAPH SHE SOUGHT
226-122538-0009 BUT THE INJURED PARTS WERE PROGRESSING FAVOURABLY AND ALL FEAR OF BRAIN COMPLICATIONS SEEMED OVER DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HOWEVER A SERIOUS REACTION FROM SHOCK HAS SET IN AND IT HAS BEEN CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO SUMMON SIR DERYCK BRAND
226-122538-0010 THE WELL KNOWN NERVE SPECIALIST IN CONSULTATION WITH THE OCULIST AND THE LOCAL PRACTITIONER IN CHARGE OF THE CASE THERE IS A FEELING OF WIDE SPREAD REGRET AND SYMPATHY IN THOSE SOCIAL AND ARTISTIC CIRCLES WHERE MISTER DALMAIN WAS SO WELL KNOWN AND SO DESERVEDLY POPULAR
226-122538-0011 THAT JANE'S HALF CROWN WAS NOT A PENNY HE HAD A SICK YOUNG WIFE AT HOME WHO HAD BEEN ORDERED EXTRA NOURISHMENT AND JUST AS THE RUSH ON BOARD BEGAN HE HAD PUT UP A SIMPLE PRAYER TO THE HEAVENLY FATHER

226-122538-0017 HERE YOU HAVE DONE VERY WELL FOR ME NO NEVER MIND THE CHANGE COFFEE AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE SHOULD FETCH A FANCY PRICE GOOD BYE THE TRAIN MOVED ON AND THE PORTER STOOD LOOKING AFTER IT WITH TEARS IN HIS EYES

226-122538-0019 YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS AND JANE SEATED IN A COMFORTABLE CORNER CHOKED BACK THE TEARS OF RELIEF WHICH THREATENED TO FALL DRANK HER COFFEE AND WAS THEREBY MORE REVIVED THAN SHE COULD HAVE THOUGHT POSSIBLE
226-122538-0020 SHE READ HIS TELEGRAM THROUGH ONCE MORE AND SMILED HOW LIKE HIM TO THINK OF THE COFFEE AND OH HOW LIKE HIM TO BE COMING TO THE STATION SHE TOOK OFF HER HAT AND LEANED BACK AGAINST THE CUSHIONS
226-122538-0021 SHE HAD BEEN TRAVELLING NIGHT AND DAY IN ONE FEVERISH WHIRL OF HASTE AND AT LAST SHE HAD BROUGHT HERSELF WITHIN REACH OF DERYCK'S HAND AND DERYCK'S SAFE CONTROL THE TURMOIL OF HER SOUL WAS STILLED
226-122538-0022 A GREAT CALM TOOK ITS PLACE AND JANE DROPPED QUIETLY OFF TO SLEEP YOUR HEAVENLY FATHER KNOWETH THAT YE HAVE NEED OF THESE THINGS WASHED AND BRUSHED AND GREATLY REFRESHED
226-122538-0023 JANE STOOD AT THE WINDOW OF HER COMPARTMENT AS THE TRAIN STEAMED INTO CHARING CROSS THE DOCTOR WAS STATIONED EXACTLY OPPOSITE THE DOOR WHEN HER CARRIAGE CAME TO A STANDSTILL
226-122538-0024 MERE CHANCE AND YET TO JANE IT SEEMED SO LIKE HIM TO HAVE TAKEN UP HIS POSITION PRECISELY AT THE RIGHT SPOT ON THAT LONG PLATFORM AN ENTHUSIASTIC LADY PATIENT HAD ONCE SAID OF DERYCK BRAND WITH MORE ACCURACY OF DEFINITION THAN OF GRAMMAR
226-122538-0025 YOU KNOW HE IS ALWAYS SO VERY JUST THERE AND THIS CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DOCTOR HAD MADE HIM TO MANY A VERY PRESENT HELP IN TIME OF TROUBLE HE WAS THROUGH THE LINE OF PORTERS AND HAD HIS HAND UPON THE HANDLE OF JANE'S DOOR IN A MOMENT
226-122538-0026 STANDING AT THE WINDOW SHE TOOK ONE LOOK AT THE FIRM LEAN FACE NOW ALIGHT WITH WELCOME AND READ IN THE KIND STEADFAST EYES OF HER CHILDHOOD'S FRIEND A PERFECT SYMPATHY AND COMPREHENSION THEN SHE SAW BEHIND HIM HER AUNT'S FOOTMAN
226-122538-0027 AND HER OWN MAID WHO HAD BEEN GIVEN A PLACE IN THE DUCHESS'S HOUSEHOLD IN ANOTHER MOMENT SHE WAS ON THE PLATFORM AND HER HAND WAS IN DERYCK'S THAT IS RIGHT DEAR HE SAID ALL FIT AND WELL I CAN SEE NOW HAND OVER YOUR KEYS
226-122538-0028 I SUPPOSE YOU HAVE NOTHING CONTRABAND I TELEPHONED THE DUCHESS TO SEND SOME OF HER PEOPLE TO MEET YOUR LUGGAGE AND NOT TO EXPECT YOU HERSELF UNTIL DINNER TIME AS YOU WERE TAKING TEA WITH US WAS THAT RIGHT THIS WAY COME OUTSIDE THE BARRIER WHAT A RABBLE
226-122538-0029 ALL WANTING TO BREAK EVERY POSSIBLE RULE AND REGULATION AND EACH TRYING TO BE THE FIRST PERSON IN THE FRONT ROW REALLY THE PATIENCE AND GOOD TEMPER OF RAILWAY OFFICIALS SHOULD TEACH THE REST OF MANKIND A LESSON THE DOCTOR TALKING ALL THE TIME
226-122538-0030 PILOTED JANE THROUGH THE CROWD OPENED THE DOOR OF A NEAT ELECTRIC BROUGHAM HELPED HER IN TOOK HIS SEAT BESIDE HER AND THEY GLIDED SWIFTLY OUT INTO THE STRAND AND TURNED TOWARDS TRAFALGAR SQUARE
226-122538-0031 WELL SAID THE DOCTOR NIAGARA IS A BIG THING ISN'T IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY TO ME WERE YOU NOT DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA WE WERE I FEEL TEMPTED TO WISH FOR ONE HOMICIDAL MOMENT THAT THE EARTH WOULD OPEN HER MOUTH AND SWALLOW THEM UP
226-122538-0032 PEOPLE WHO CAN BE DISAPPOINTED IN NIAGARA AND TALK ABOUT IT SHOULD NO LONGER BE ALLOWED TO CRAWL ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH AND HOW ABOUT THE LITTLE MOTHER ISN'T SHE WORTH KNOWING I HOPE SHE SENT ME HER LOVE AND NEW YORK HARBOUR
226-122538-0033 HE WILL ALWAYS BE BLIND DEAR BUT LIFE HOLDS OTHER THINGS BESIDE SIGHT WE MUST NEVER SAY NO HOPE WILL HE LIVE THERE IS NO REASON HE SHOULD NOT LIVE
226-122538-0034 BUT HOW FAR LIFE WILL BE WORTH LIVING LARGELY DEPENDS UPON WHAT CAN BE DONE FOR HIM POOR CHAP DURING THE NEXT FEW MONTHS HE IS MORE SHATTERED MENTALLY THAN PHYSICALLY
226-131532-0000 WHEN ALL WERE GONE I LEARNT THAT THE VILE SLANDER HAD INDEED BEEN CIRCULATED THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY IN THE VERY PRESENCE OF THE VICTIM ROSE HOWEVER VOWED SHE DID NOT AND WOULD NOT BELIEVE IT
226-131532-0001 AND MY MOTHER MADE THE SAME DECLARATION THOUGH NOT I FEAR WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF REAL UNWAVERING INCREDULITY IT SEEMED TO DWELL CONTINUALLY ON HER MIND AND SHE KEPT IRRITATING ME FROM TIME TO TIME BY SUCH EXPRESSIONS AS
226-131532-0002 THE FOUNDATION IS IN THE WICKEDNESS AND FALSEHOOD OF THE WORLD SAID I AND IN THE FACT THAT MISTER LAWRENCE HAS BEEN SEEN TO GO THAT WAY ONCE OR TWICE OF AN EVENING AND THE VILLAGE GOSSIPS SAY HE GOES TO PAY HIS ADDRESSES TO THE STRANGE LADY
226-131532-0003 AND THE SCANDAL MONGERS HAVE GREEDILY SEIZED THE RUMOUR TO MAKE IT THE BASIS OF THEIR OWN INFERNAL STRUCTURE WELL BUT GILBERT THERE MUST BE SOMETHING IN HER MANNER TO COUNTENANCE SUCH REPORTS DID YOU SEE ANYTHING IN HER MANNER
226-131532-0004 NO CERTAINLY BUT THEN YOU KNOW I ALWAYS SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING STRANGE ABOUT HER I BELIEVE IT WAS ON THAT VERY EVENING THAT I VENTURED ON ANOTHER INVASION OF WILDFELL HALL FROM THE TIME OF OUR PARTY
226-131532-0005 WHICH WAS UPWARDS OF A WEEK AGO I HAD BEEN MAKING DAILY EFFORTS TO MEET ITS MISTRESS IN HER WALKS AND ALWAYS DISAPPOINTED SHE MUST HAVE MANAGED IT SO ON PURPOSE HAD NIGHTLY KEPT REVOLVING IN MY MIND SOME PRETEXT FOR ANOTHER CALL
226-131532-0006 AT LENGTH I CONCLUDED THAT THE SEPARATION COULD BE ENDURED NO LONGER BY THIS TIME YOU WILL SEE I WAS PRETTY FAR GONE AND TAKING FROM THE BOOK CASE AN OLD VOLUME THAT I THOUGHT SHE MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN
226-131532-0007 THOUGH FROM ITS UNSIGHTLY AND SOMEWHAT DILAPIDATED CONDITION I HAD NOT YET VENTURED TO OFFER IT FOR PERUSAL I HASTENED AWAY BUT NOT WITHOUT SUNDRY MISGIVINGS AS TO HOW SHE WOULD RECEIVE ME
226-131532-0008 OR HOW I COULD SUMMON COURAGE TO PRESENT MYSELF WITH SO SLIGHT AN EXCUSE BUT PERHAPS I MIGHT SEE HER IN THE FIELD OR THE GARDEN AND THEN THERE WOULD BE NO GREAT DIFFICULTY IT WAS THE FORMAL KNOCKING AT THE DOOR
226-131532-0009 WITH THE PROSPECT OF BEING GRAVELY USHERED IN BY RACHEL TO THE PRESENCE OF A SURPRISED UNCORDIAL MISTRESS THAT SO GREATLY DISTURBED ME MY WISH HOWEVER WAS NOT GRATIFIED
226-131532-0010 MISSUS GRAHAM HERSELF WAS NOT TO BE SEEN BUT THERE WAS ARTHUR PLAYING WITH HIS FROLICSOME LITTLE DOG IN THE GARDEN I LOOKED OVER THE GATE AND CALLED HIM TO ME HE WANTED ME TO COME IN BUT I TOLD HIM I COULD NOT WITHOUT HIS MOTHER'S LEAVE
226-131532-0011 HE RAN TO PERFORM MY BIDDING AND QUICKLY RETURNED WITH HIS MOTHER HOW LOVELY SHE LOOKED WITH HER DARK RINGLETS STREAMING IN THE LIGHT SUMMER BREEZE HER FAIR CHEEK SLIGHTLY FLUSHED AND HER COUNTENANCE RADIANT WITH SMILES
226-131532-0012 THERE IS NO MEDIATOR LIKE A MERRY SIMPLE HEARTED CHILD EVER READY TO CEMENT DIVIDED HEARTS TO SPAN THE UNFRIENDLY GULF OF CUSTOM TO MELT THE ICE OF COLD RESERVE AND OVERTHROW THE SEPARATING WALLS OF DREAD FORMALITY AND PRIDE
226-131532-0013 WELL MISTER MARKHAM WHAT IS IT SAID THE YOUNG MOTHER ACCOSTING ME WITH A PLEASANT SMILE I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT THIS BOOK AND IF YOU PLEASE TO TAKE IT AND PERUSE IT AT YOUR LEISURE
226-131532-0014 I MAKE NO APOLOGY FOR CALLING YOU OUT ON SUCH A LOVELY EVENING THOUGH IT BE FOR A MATTER OF NO GREATER IMPORTANCE TELL HIM TO COME IN MAMMA SAID ARTHUR WOULD YOU LIKE TO COME IN ASKED THE LADY YES
226-131532-0015 I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE YOUR IMPROVEMENTS IN THE GARDEN AND HOW YOUR SISTER'S ROOTS HAVE PROSPERED IN MY CHARGE ADDED SHE AS SHE OPENED THE GATE AND WE SAUNTERED THROUGH THE GARDEN AND TALKED OF THE FLOWERS THE TREES AND THE BOOK
226-131532-0016 AND THEN OF OTHER THINGS THE EVENING WAS KIND AND GENIAL AND SO WAS MY COMPANION BY DEGREES I WAXED MORE WARM AND TENDER THAN PERHAPS I HAD EVER BEEN BEFORE
226-131532-0017 BUT STILL I SAID NOTHING TANGIBLE AND SHE ATTEMPTED NO REPULSE UNTIL IN PASSING A MOSS ROSE TREE THAT I HAD BROUGHT HER SOME WEEKS SINCE IN MY SISTER'S NAME
226-131532-0018 AND I SAW A FLASH OF ECSTATIC BRILLIANCE IN HER EYE A GLOW OF GLAD EXCITEMENT ON HER FACE I THOUGHT MY HOUR OF VICTORY WAS COME BUT INSTANTLY A PAINFUL RECOLLECTION SEEMED TO FLASH UPON HER
226-131532-0019 A CLOUD OF ANGUISH DARKENED HER BROW A MARBLE PALENESS BLANCHED HER CHEEK AND LIP THERE SEEMED A MOMENT OF INWARD CONFLICT AND WITH A SUDDEN EFFORT SHE WITHDREW HER HAND AND RETREATED A STEP OR TWO BACK
226-131532-0020 NOW MISTER MARKHAM SAID SHE WITH A KIND OF DESPERATE CALMNESS I MUST TELL YOU PLAINLY THAT I CANNOT DO WITH THIS I LIKE YOUR COMPANY BECAUSE I AM ALONE HERE
226-131532-0021 AND LET ME ALONE HEREAFTER IN FACT WE MUST BE STRANGERS FOR THE FUTURE I WILL THEN BE YOUR FRIEND OR BROTHER OR ANYTHING YOU WISH IF YOU WILL ONLY LET ME CONTINUE TO SEE YOU BUT TELL ME WHY I CANNOT BE ANYTHING MORE
226-131532-0022 THERE WAS A PERPLEXED AND THOUGHTFUL PAUSE IS IT IN CONSEQUENCE OF SOME RASH VOW IT IS SOMETHING OF THE KIND SHE ANSWERED SOME DAY I MAY TELL YOU BUT AT PRESENT YOU HAD BETTER LEAVE ME
226-131532-0023 AND NEVER GILBERT PUT ME TO THE PAINFUL NECESSITY OF REPEATING WHAT I HAVE JUST NOW SAID TO YOU SHE EARNESTLY ADDED GIVING ME HER HAND IN SERIOUS KINDNESS HOW SWEET HOW MUSICAL MY OWN NAME SOUNDED IN HER MOUTH
226-131532-0024 I WILL NOT I REPLIED BUT YOU PARDON THIS OFFENCE ON CONDITION THAT YOU NEVER REPEAT IT AND MAY I COME TO SEE YOU NOW AND THEN PERHAPS OCCASIONALLY
226-131532-0025 PROVIDED YOU NEVER ABUSE THE PRIVILEGE I MAKE NO EMPTY PROMISES BUT YOU SHALL SEE THE MOMENT YOU DO OUR INTIMACY IS AT AN END THAT'S ALL AND WILL YOU ALWAYS CALL ME GILBERT
226-131532-0026 BUT AS I WENT THE TRAMP OF HORSES HOOFS FELL ON MY EAR AND BROKE THE STILLNESS OF THE DEWY EVENING AND LOOKING TOWARDS THE LANE I SAW A SOLITARY EQUESTRIAN COMING UP INCLINING TO DUSK AS IT WAS
226-131532-0027 AND SEEMED INCLINED TO TURN BACK BUT ON SECOND THOUGHT APPARENTLY JUDGED IT BETTER TO CONTINUE HIS COURSE AS BEFORE HE ACCOSTED ME WITH A SLIGHT BOW AND EDGING CLOSE TO THE WALL ENDEAVOURED TO PASS ON BUT I WAS NOT SO MINDED
226-131532-0028 YOU AND YOUR PONY BE WHAT MAKES YOU SO COARSE AND BRUTAL MARKHAM I'M QUITE ASHAMED OF YOU YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS BEFORE YOU LEAVE THIS SPOT I WILL KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS PERFIDIOUS DUPLICITY
226-131532-0029 IF YOU STAND TILL MORNING NOW THEN SAID I UNCLOSING MY HAND BUT STILL STANDING BEFORE HIM ASK ME SOME OTHER TIME WHEN YOU CAN SPEAK LIKE A GENTLEMAN RETURNED HE AND HE MADE AN EFFORT TO PASS ME AGAIN
226-131532-0030 BUT I QUICKLY RE CAPTURED THE PONY SCARCE LESS ASTONISHED THAN ITS MASTER AT SUCH UNCIVIL USAGE REALLY MISTER MARKHAM THIS IS TOO MUCH SAID THE LATTER CAN I NOT GO TO SEE MY TENANT ON MATTERS OF BUSINESS WITHOUT BEING ASSAULTED IN THIS MANNER BY
226-131532-0031 AND IN TRUTH THE VICAR WAS JUST BEHIND ME PLODDING HOMEWARD FROM SOME REMOTE CORNER OF HIS PARISH I IMMEDIATELY RELEASED THE SQUIRE AND HE WENT ON HIS WAY SALUTING MISTER MILLWARD AS HE PASSED
226-131532-0032 WHAT QUARRELLING MARKHAM CRIED THE LATTER ADDRESSING HIMSELF TO ME
226-131532-0033 BUT LET ME TELL YOU YOUNG MAN HERE HE PUT HIS FACE INTO MINE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONFIDENTIAL AIR SHE'S NOT WORTH IT AND HE CONFIRMED THE ASSERTION BY A SOLEMN NOD
226-131532-0034 WITH A LOOK THAT PLAINLY SAID WHAT THIS TO ME
226-131533-0000 YOU MUST SUPPOSE ABOUT THREE WEEKS PASSED OVER MISSUS GRAHAM AND I WERE NOW ESTABLISHED FRIENDS OR BROTHER AND SISTER AS WE RATHER CHOSE TO CONSIDER OURSELVES
226-131533-0001 SHE CALLED ME GILBERT BY MY EXPRESS DESIRE AND I CALLED HER HELEN FOR I HAD SEEN THAT NAME WRITTEN IN HER BOOKS I SELDOM ATTEMPTED TO SEE HER ABOVE TWICE A WEEK
226-131533-0002 AND STILL I MADE OUR MEETINGS APPEAR THE RESULT OF ACCIDENT AS OFTEN AS I COULD FOR I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL AND ALTOGETHER I BEHAVED WITH SUCH EXCEEDING PROPRIETY THAT SHE NEVER HAD OCCASION TO REPROVE ME ONCE
226-131533-0003 YET I COULD NOT BUT PERCEIVE THAT SHE WAS AT TIMES UNHAPPY AND DISSATISFIED WITH HERSELF OR HER POSITION AND TRULY I MYSELF WAS NOT QUITE CONTENTED WITH THE LATTER THIS ASSUMPTION OF BROTHERLY NONCHALANCE WAS VERY HARD TO SUSTAIN
226-131533-0004 AND I OFTEN FELT MYSELF A MOST CONFOUNDED HYPOCRITE WITH IT ALL I SAW TOO OR RATHER I FELT THAT IN SPITE OF HERSELF I WAS NOT INDIFFERENT TO HER AS THE NOVEL HEROES MODESTLY EXPRESS IT
226-131533-0005 AND WHILE I THANKFULLY ENJOYED MY PRESENT GOOD FORTUNE I COULD NOT FAIL TO WISH AND HOPE FOR SOMETHING BETTER IN FUTURE BUT OF COURSE I KEPT SUCH DREAMS ENTIRELY TO MYSELF
226-131533-0006 YOU'RE GOING TO WILDFELL HALL AREN'T YOU WHAT MAKES YOU THINK SO BECAUSE YOU LOOK AS IF YOU WERE BUT I WISH YOU WOULDN'T GO SO OFTEN NONSENSE CHILD I DON'T GO ONCE IN SIX WEEKS WHAT DO YOU MEAN
226-131533-0007 WELL BUT IF I WERE YOU I WOULDN'T HAVE SO MUCH TO DO WITH MISSUS GRAHAM WHY ROSE ARE YOU TOO GIVING IN TO THE PREVAILING OPINION NO RETURNED SHE HESITATINGLY
226-131533-0008 BOTH AT THE WILSONS AND THE VICARAGE AND BESIDES MAMMA SAYS IF SHE WERE A PROPER PERSON SHE WOULD NOT BE LIVING THERE BY HERSELF AND DON'T YOU REMEMBER LAST WINTER GILBERT ALL THAT ABOUT THE FALSE NAME TO THE PICTURE
226-131533-0009 AND HOW SHE EXPLAINED IT SAYING SHE HAD FRIENDS OR ACQUAINTANCES FROM WHOM SHE WISHED HER PRESENT RESIDENCE TO BE CONCEALED AND THAT SHE WAS AFRAID OF THEIR TRACING HER OUT AND THEN HOW SUDDENLY SHE STARTED UP AND LEFT THE ROOM WHEN THAT PERSON CAME
226-131533-0010 WHOM SHE TOOK GOOD CARE NOT TO LET US CATCH A GLIMPSE OF AND WHO ARTHUR WITH SUCH AN AIR OF MYSTERY TOLD US WAS HIS MAMMA'S FRIEND YES ROSE I REMEMBER IT ALL AND I CAN FORGIVE YOUR UNCHARITABLE CONCLUSIONS
226-131533-0011 FOR PERHAPS IF I DID NOT KNOW HER MYSELF I SHOULD PUT ALL THESE THINGS TOGETHER AND BELIEVE THE SAME AS YOU DO BUT THANK GOD I DO KNOW HER AND I SHOULD BE UNWORTHY THE NAME OF A MAN IF I COULD BELIEVE ANYTHING THAT WAS SAID AGAINST HER
226-131533-0012 UNLESS I HEARD IT FROM HER OWN LIPS I SHOULD AS SOON BELIEVE SUCH THINGS OF YOU ROSE OH GILBERT WELL
226-131533-0013 YOU KNOW NOTHING OF HER FORMER LIFE AND LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME YOU DID NOT KNOW THAT SUCH A PERSON EXISTED NO MATTER THERE IS SUCH A THING AS LOOKING THROUGH A PERSON'S EYES INTO THE HEART AND LEARNING MORE OF THE HEIGHT AND BREADTH
226-131533-0014 AND DEPTH OF ANOTHER'S SOUL IN ONE HOUR THAN IT MIGHT TAKE YOU A LIFETIME TO DISCOVER IF HE OR SHE WERE NOT DISPOSED TO REVEAL IT OR IF YOU HAD NOT THE SENSE TO UNDERSTAND IT THEN YOU ARE GOING TO SEE HER THIS EVENING
226-131533-0015 MISSUS GRAHAM AND I ARE TWO FRIENDS AND WILL BE AND NO MAN BREATHING SHALL HINDER IT OR HAS A RIGHT TO INTERFERE BETWEEN US BUT IF YOU KNEW HOW THEY TALK YOU WOULD BE MORE CAREFUL FOR HER SAKE AS WELL AS FOR YOUR OWN
226-131533-0016 JANE WILSON THINKS YOUR VISITS TO THE OLD HALL BUT ANOTHER PROOF OF HER DEPRAVITY CONFOUND JANE WILSON AND ELIZA MILLWARD IS QUITE GRIEVED ABOUT YOU I HOPE SHE IS
226-131533-0017 BUT I WOULDN'T IF I WERE YOU WOULDN'T WHAT HOW DO THEY KNOW THAT I GO THERE THERE'S NOTHING HID FROM THEM THEY SPY OUT EVERYTHING OH I NEVER THOUGHT OF THIS
226-131533-0018 AND SO THEY DARE TO TURN MY FRIENDSHIP INTO FOOD FOR FURTHER SCANDAL AGAINST HER THAT PROVES THE FALSEHOOD OF THEIR OTHER LIES AT ALL EVENTS IF ANY PROOF WERE WANTING MIND YOU CONTRADICT THEM ROSE WHENEVER YOU CAN
226-131533-0019 BUT THEY DON'T SPEAK OPENLY TO ME ABOUT SUCH THINGS IT IS ONLY BY HINTS AND INNUENDOES AND BY WHAT I HEAR OTHERS SAY THAT I KNEW WHAT THEY THINK WELL THEN I WON'T GO TO DAY AS IT'S GETTING LATISH
226-131533-0020 AFTER HIS CUSTOMARY CHEERFUL AND FATHERLY GREETING OF ROSE WHO WAS RATHER A FAVOURITE WITH THE OLD GENTLEMAN HE TURNED SOMEWHAT STERNLY TO ME WELL SIR SAID HE YOU'RE QUITE A STRANGER IT IS
226-131533-0021 AS HE DEPOSITED HIS PONDEROUS BULK IN THE ARM CHAIR THAT ROSE OFFICIOUSLY BROUGHT TOWARDS HIM IT IS JUST SIX WEEKS BY MY RECKONING SINCE YOU DARKENED MY DOOR HE SPOKE IT WITH EMPHASIS AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR
226-131533-0022 IS IT SIR SAID I AY IT IS SO HE ADDED AN AFFIRMATORY NOD AND CONTINUED TO GAZE UPON ME WITH A KIND OF IRATE SOLEMNITY HOLDING HIS SUBSTANTIAL STICK BETWEEN HIS KNEES
226-131533-0023 WITH HIS HANDS CLASPED UPON ITS HEAD I HAVE BEEN BUSY I SAID FOR AN APOLOGY WAS EVIDENTLY DEMANDED BUSY REPEATED HE DERISIVELY YES YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN GETTING IN MY HAY
226-131533-0024 IN TIME FOR TEA BUT OFFERED TO HAVE SOME IMMEDIATELY PREPARED IF HE WOULD DO HER THE FAVOUR TO PARTAKE OF IT NOT ANY FOR ME I THANK YOU REPLIED HE I SHALL BE AT HOME IN A FEW MINUTES OH BUT DO STAY AND TAKE A LITTLE
226-131533-0025 IT WILL BE READY IN FIVE MINUTES BUT HE REJECTED THE OFFER WITH A MAJESTIC WAVE OF THE HAND I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I'LL TAKE MISSUS MARKHAM SAID HE I'LL TAKE A GLASS OF YOUR EXCELLENT ALE
226-131533-0026 WITH PLEASURE CRIED MY MOTHER PROCEEDING WITH ALACRITY TO PULL THE BELL AND ORDER THE FAVOURED BEVERAGE I THOUGHT CONTINUED HE I'D JUST LOOK IN UPON YOU AS I PASSED AND TASTE YOUR HOME BREWED ALE
226-131533-0027 REALLY EJACULATED MY MOTHER WHY SO MISTER MILLWARD ASKED I HE LOOKED AT ME WITH SOME SEVERITY AND TURNING AGAIN TO MY MOTHER REPEATED
226-131533-0028 AND STRUCK HIS STICK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN MY MOTHER SAT OPPOSITE AN AWE STRUCK BUT ADMIRING AUDITOR MISSUS GRAHAM SAID I HE CONTINUED SHAKING HIS HEAD AS HE SPOKE
226-131533-0029 THESE ARE TERRIBLE REPORTS WHAT SIR SAYS SHE AFFECTING TO BE IGNORANT OF MY MEANING IT IS MY DUTY AS YOUR PASTOR SAID I TO TELL YOU BOTH EVERYTHING THAT I MYSELF SEE REPREHENSIBLE IN YOUR CONDUCT
226-131533-0030 AND ALL I HAVE REASON TO SUSPECT AND WHAT OTHERS TELL ME CONCERNING YOU SO I TOLD HER YOU DID SIR CRIED I STARTING FROM MY SEAT AND STRIKING MY FIST ON THE TABLE
226-131533-0031 BUT SHE OFFERED NO EXTENUATION OR DEFENCE AND WITH A KIND OF SHAMELESS CALMNESS SHOCKING INDEED TO WITNESS IN ONE SO YOUNG AS GOOD AS TOLD ME THAT MY REMONSTRANCE WAS UNAVAILING AND MY PASTORAL ADVICE QUITE THROWN AWAY UPON HER
226-131533-0032 NAY THAT MY VERY PRESENCE WAS DISPLEASING WHILE I SPOKE SUCH THINGS AND I WITHDREW AT LENGTH TOO PLAINLY SEEING THAT NOTHING COULD BE DONE AND SADLY GRIEVED TO FIND HER CASE SO HOPELESS
226-131533-0033 BUT I AM FULLY DETERMINED MISSUS MARKHAM THAT MY DAUGHTERS SHALL NOT CONSORT WITH HER DO YOU ADOPT THE SAME RESOLUTION WITH REGARD TO YOURS AS FOR YOUR SONS AS FOR YOU YOUNG MAN HE CONTINUED STERNLY TURNING TO ME
226-131533-0034 SLAMMING THE DOOR BEHIND ME WITH A BANG THAT SHOOK THE HOUSE TO ITS FOUNDATIONS AND MADE MY MOTHER SCREAM AND GAVE A MOMENTARY RELIEF TO MY EXCITED FEELINGS
226-131533-0035 THE NEXT MINUTE SAW ME HURRYING WITH RAPID STRIDES IN THE DIRECTION OF WILDFELL HALL TO WHAT INTENT OR PURPOSE I COULD SCARCELY TELL BUT I MUST BE MOVING SOMEWHERE AND NO OTHER GOAL WOULD DO
226-131533-0036 I MUST SEE HER TOO AND SPEAK TO HER THAT WAS CERTAIN BUT WHAT TO SAY OR HOW TO ACT I HAD NO DEFINITE IDEA
2289-152253-0000 THE HUNS HAD A FAMOUS KING NAMED AT'TI LA HE WAS ONLY TWENTY ONE YEARS OLD WHEN HE BECAME THEIR KING BUT ALTHOUGH HE WAS YOUNG HE WAS VERY BRAVE AND AMBITIOUS AND HE WANTED TO BE A GREAT AND POWERFUL KING NOT FAR FROM ATTILA'S PALACE
2289-152253-0001 THERE WAS A GREAT ROCKY CAVE IN THE MOUNTAINS IN THIS CAVE LIVED A STRANGE MAN CALLED THE HERMIT OF THE ROCKS
2289-152253-0002 HE WAS VERY OLD WITH WRINKLED FACE AND LONG GRAY HAIR AND BEARD MANY PERSONS BELIEVED THAT HE WAS A FORTUNE TELLER SO PEOPLE OFTEN WENT TO HIM TO INQUIRE WHAT WAS TO HAPPEN TO THEM
2289-152253-0003 ONE DAY SHORTLY AFTER HE BECAME KING ATTILA WENT TO THE CAVE TO GET HIS FORTUNE TOLD WISE MAN SAID HE LOOK INTO THE FUTURE AND TELL ME WHAT IS BEFORE ME IN THE PATH OF LIFE THE HERMIT THOUGHT FOR A FEW MOMENTS AND THEN SAID
2289-152253-0004 O KING I SEE YOU A FAMOUS CONQUEROR THE MASTER OF MANY NATIONS I SEE YOU GOING FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY DEFEATING ARMIES AND DESTROYING CITIES UNTIL MEN CALL YOU THE FEAR OF THE WORLD YOU HEAP UP VAST RICHES
2289-152253-0005 BUT HE WAS YOUNG AND FULL OF SPIRIT AND VERY SOON HE REMEMBERED ONLY WHAT HAD BEEN SAID TO HIM ABOUT HIS BECOMING A GREAT AND FAMOUS CONQUEROR AND BEGAN TO PREPARE FOR WAR HE GATHERED TOGETHER THE BEST MEN
2289-152253-0006 FROM THE VARIOUS TRIBES OF HIS PEOPLE AND TRAINED THEM INTO A GREAT ARMY OF GOOD SOLDIERS TWO ABOUT THIS TIME ONE OF THE KING'S SHEPHERDS WHILE TAKING CARE OF CATTLE IN THE FIELDS
2289-152253-0007 NOTICED BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE FOOT OF ONE OF THE OXEN THE SHEPHERD FOLLOWED THE STREAK OF BLOOD THROUGH THE GRASS AND AT LAST FOUND THE SHARP POINT OF A SWORD STICKING OUT OF THE EARTH HE DUG OUT THE WEAPON CARRIED IT TO THE PALACE
2289-152253-0008 AS LONG AS I FIGHT WITH THE SWORD OF TIEW AS SOON AS HIS ARMY WAS READY HE MARCHED WITH IT INTO COUNTRIES WHICH BELONGED TO ROME HE DEFEATED THE ROMANS IN SEVERAL GREAT BATTLES AND CAPTURED MANY OF THEIR CITIES
2289-152253-0009 THE ROMAN EMPEROR THEODOSIUS HAD TO ASK FOR TERMS OF PEACE ATTILA AGREED THAT THERE SHOULD BE PEACE BUT SOON AFTERWARDS HE FOUND OUT THAT THEODOSIUS HAD FORMED A PLOT TO MURDER HIM
2289-152253-0010 HE WAS SO ENRAGED AT THIS THAT HE AGAIN BEGAN WAR
2289-152253-0011 AND AT LAST THE EMPEROR HAD TO GIVE HIM A LARGE SUM OF MONEY
2289-152253-0012 THIS MADE PEACE BUT THE PEACE DID NOT LAST LONG IN A FEW YEARS ATTILA APPEARED AT THE HEAD OF AN ARMY OF SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN WITH THIS GREAT FORCE HE MARCHED ACROSS GERMANY AND INTO GAUL
2289-152253-0013 HE ATTACKED AND DESTROYED TOWNS AND KILLED THE INHABITANTS WITHOUT MERCY THE PEOPLE HAD SUCH DREAD OF HIM THAT HE WAS CALLED THE SCOURGE OF GOD AND THE FEAR OF THE WORLD THREE
2289-152253-0014 ATTILA AND HIS TERRIBLE HUNS MARCHED THROUGH GAUL UNTIL THEY CAME TO THE CITY OF ORLEANS HERE THE PEOPLE BRAVELY RESISTED THE INVADERS THEY SHUT THEIR GATES AND DEFENDED THEMSELVES IN EVERY WAY THEY COULD
2289-152253-0015 IN THOSE TIMES ALL TOWNS OF ANY GREAT SIZE WERE SURROUNDED BY STRONG WALLS THERE WAS WAR CONSTANTLY GOING ON
2289-152253-0016 WHO LIVED BY ROBBING THEIR NEIGHBORS SO THE TOWNS AND CASTLES IN WHICH THERE WAS
2289-152253-0017 WERE NOT SAFE WITHOUT HIGH AND STRONG WALLS ATTILA TRIED TO TAKE ORLEANS BUT SOON AFTER HE BEGAN TO ATTACK THE WALLS HE SAW A GREAT ARMY AT A DISTANCE COMING TOWARDS THE CITY
2289-152253-0018 THE ARMY WHICH ATTILA SAW WAS AN ARMY OF THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ROMANS AND VISIGOTHS IT WAS LED BY A ROMAN GENERAL
2289-152253-0019 THE VISIGOTHS AFTER THE DEATH OF
2289-152253-0020 HAD SETTLED IN PARTS OF GAUL AND THEIR KING HAD NOW AGREED TO JOIN THE ROMANS AGAINST THE COMMON ENEMY THE TERRIBLE HUNS SO THE GREAT ARMY OF THE ROMANS AND VISIGOTHS
2289-152253-0021 THOR'IS MOND THE SON OF THEODORIC
2289-152253-0022 WHEN HIS FATHER WAS KILLED AND NOW HE LED THEM ON TO FIGHT THEY WERE ALL EAGER TO HAVE REVENGE FOR THE DEATH OF THEIR KING SO THEY FOUGHT LIKE LIONS AND SWEPT ACROSS THE PLAIN WITH GREAT FURY THE HUNS WERE SOON BEATEN ON EVERY SIDE
2289-152253-0023 AND ATTILA HIMSELF FLED TO HIS CAMP IT WAS THE FIRST TIME HE HAD EVER BEEN DEFEATED THORISMOND THE CONQUEROR WAS LIFTED UPON HIS SHIELD ON THE BATTLE FIELD AND HAILED AS KING OF THE VISIGOTHS
2289-152253-0024 WHEN ATTILA REACHED HIS CAMP HE HAD ALL HIS BAGGAGE AND WAGONS GATHERED IN A GREAT HEAP HE INTENDED TO SET FIRE TO IT AND JUMP INTO THE FLAMES IF THE ROMANS SHOULD COME THERE TO ATTACK HIM
2289-152253-0025 HERE I WILL PERISH IN THE FLAMES HE CRIED RATHER THAN SURRENDER TO MY ENEMIES
2289-152253-0026 VERY SOON HOWEVER HE WAS AGAIN ON THE WAR PATH THIS TIME HE INVADED ITALY
2289-152253-0027 AND THEY HAD NO ARMY STRONG ENOUGH TO SEND AGAINST HIM ROME WOULD HAVE BEEN AGAIN DESTROYED IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR POPE LEO
2289-152253-0028 AND PERSUADED HIM NOT TO ATTACK THE CITY IT IS SAID THAT THE BARBARIAN KING
2289-152253-0029 THEY ENCLOSED HIS BODY IN THREE COFFINS ONE OF GOLD ONE OF SILVER AND ONE OF IRON
2289-152253-0030 WHEN THE FUNERAL WAS OVER THEY KILLED THE SLAVES WHO HAD DUG THE GRAVE
2289-152254-0000 WHEN HE WAS BUT TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE HE WAS LAME IN ONE LEG AND LOOKED AS IF HE WERE A VERY ORDINARY PERSON LIKE MOST OF THE VANDALS HE WAS A CRUEL AND CUNNING MAN BUT HE HAD GREAT ABILITY IN MANY WAYS
2289-152254-0001 BUT A PLOT WAS FORMED AGAINST HIM
2289-152254-0002 AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO MAKE WAR AGAINST ROME AT THE SAME TIME HE WROTE SECRETLY TO COUNT BONIFACE AND TOLD HIM THAT IF HE CAME TO ROME THE EMPRESS WOULD PUT HIM TO DEATH BONIFACE BELIEVED THIS STORY
2289-152254-0003 HE ALSO SENT A LETTER TO GENSERIC INVITING HIM TO COME TO AFRICA WITH AN ARMY GENSERIC WAS GREATLY DELIGHTED TO RECEIVE THE INVITATION FROM BONIFACE HE HAD LONG WANTED TO ATTACK ROME AND TAKE FROM HER SOME OF THE RICH COUNTRIES SHE HAD CONQUERED
2289-152254-0004 AND MARCHED INTO OTHER PARTS OF THE COAST AND CAPTURED TOWNS AND CITIES BY THIS TIME BONIFACE HAD LEARNED ALL ABOUT THE WICKED PLOT OF AETIUS HE NOW REGRETTED HAVING INVITED THE VANDALS TO AFRICA AND TRIED TO INDUCE THEM TO RETURN TO SPAIN
2289-152254-0005 BUT GENSERIC STERNLY REFUSED NEVER HE SAID SHALL I GO BACK TO SPAIN UNTIL I AM MASTER OF AFRICA THEN CRIED BONIFACE I WILL DRIVE YOU BACK SOON AFTERWARDS THERE WAS A BATTLE BETWEEN THE ROMANS AND VANDALS AND THE ROMANS WERE DEFEATED
2289-152254-0006 THEY WERE ALSO DEFEATED IN SEVERAL OTHER BATTLES AT LAST THEY HAD TO FLEE FOR SAFETY TO TWO OR THREE TOWNS WHICH THE VANDALS HAD NOT YET TAKEN ONE OF THESE TOWNS WAS HIPPO GENSERIC CAPTURED THIS TOWN
2289-152254-0007 DESTROYS VALUABLE PROPERTY A GREAT MANY OF THE NATIVES OF AFRICA JOINED THE ARMY OF GENSERIC THEY HAD FOR A LONG TIME BEEN ILL TREATED BY THE ROMANS AND WERE GLAD TO SEE THEM DEFEATED
2289-152254-0008 HE BUILT GREAT FLEETS AND SAILED OVER THE MEDITERRANEAN CAPTURING TRADING VESSELS FOR MANY YEARS HE PLUNDERED TOWNS ALONG THE COASTS
2289-152254-0009 AFTER RULING SEVERAL YEARS VALENTINIAN HAD JUST BEEN MURDERED BY A ROMAN NOBLE NAMED MAXIMUS WHO HAD AT ONCE MADE HIMSELF EMPEROR WHEN THE MESSENGER ENTERED THE ROOM WHERE GENSERIC WAS HE SAID GREAT KING
2289-152254-0010 I BRING YOU A MESSAGE FROM THE EMPRESS EUDOXIA SHE BEGS YOUR HELP SHE AND HER TWO BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTERS ARE IN DANGER IN ROME SHE WISHES YOU TO PROTECT THEM AGAINST MAXIMUS SHE INVITES YOU TO COME WITH AN ARMY TO ROME AND TAKE THE CITY
2289-152254-0011 SHE AND HER FRIENDS WILL HELP YOU AS MUCH AS THEY CAN WITH A CRY OF JOY GENSERIC SPRANG TO HIS FEET AND EXCLAIMED TELL THE EMPRESS THAT I ACCEPT HER INVITATION I SHALL SET OUT FOR ROME IMMEDIATELY
2289-152254-0012 I SHALL SET OUT FOR ROME IMMEDIATELY I SHALL PROTECT EUDOXIA AND HER FRIENDS GENSERIC THEN GOT READY A FLEET AND A GREAT ARMY AND SAILED ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN
2289-152254-0013 TO THE MOUTH OF THE TIBER WHEN THE EMPEROR MAXIMUS HEARD THAT THE VANDALS WERE COMING HE PREPARED TO FLEE FROM THE CITY AND HE ADVISED THE SENATE TO DO THE SAME THE PEOPLE WERE SO ANGRY AT THIS
2289-152254-0014 IT WAS ONLY FORTY FIVE YEARS SINCE ALARIC HAD BEEN THERE
2289-152254-0015 BUT SINCE THEN ROME HAD BECOME AGAIN GRAND AND WEALTHY SO THERE WAS PLENTY FOR GENSERIC AND HIS VANDALS TO CARRY AWAY THEY SPENT FOURTEEN DAYS IN THE WORK OF PLUNDER THEY SACKED THE TEMPLES
2289-152254-0016 AND PUBLIC BUILDINGS AND PRIVATE HOUSES
2289-152254-0017 SOME YEARS AFTER THE CAPTURE OF ROME BY GENSERIC THERE WAS A ROMAN EMPEROR NAMED MA JO'RI AN HE WAS A GOOD RULER AND A BRAVE MAN THE VANDALS STILL CONTINUED TO ATTACK AND PLUNDER CITIES IN ITALY
2289-152254-0018 AND OTHER COUNTRIES BELONGING TO ROME AND MAJORIAN RESOLVED TO PUNISH THEM SO HE GOT TOGETHER A GREAT ARMY AND BUILT A FLEET OF THREE HUNDRED SHIPS TO CARRY HIS TROOPS TO CARTHAGE
2289-152254-0019 BUT HE FIRST MARCHED HIS MEN ACROSS THE ALPS THROUGH GAUL AND DOWN TO THE SEAPORT OF CARTHAGENA IN SPAIN WHERE HIS FLEET WAS STATIONED HE TOOK THIS ROUTE BECAUSE HE EXPECTED TO ADD TO HIS FORCES
2289-152254-0020 AS HE WENT ALONG BEFORE SAILING WITH HIS ARMY FOR CARTHAGE HE WISHED VERY MUCH TO SEE WITH HIS OWN EYES WHAT SORT OF PEOPLE THE VANDALS WERE AND WHETHER THEY WERE SO POWERFUL AT HOME AS WAS GENERALLY BELIEVED
2289-152254-0021 AND ENTERTAINED HIM HOSPITABLY NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS THE EMPEROR MAJORIAN OF COURSE PEACE WAS NOT MADE THE EMPEROR LEFT CARTHAGE AFTER HAVING GOT AS MUCH INFORMATION AS HE COULD
2289-152254-0022 BUT GENSERIC DID NOT WAIT FOR THE ROMAN FLEET TO COME TO ATTACK HIM IN HIS CAPITAL WHEN HE GOT WORD THAT IT WAS IN THE BAY OF CARTHAGENA HE SAILED THERE WITH A FLEET OF HIS OWN AND IN A SINGLE DAY BURNED OR SANK NEARLY ALL THE ROMAN SHIPS
2289-152254-0023 AFTER THIS THE VANDALS BECAME MORE THAN EVER THE TERROR OF THE MEDITERRANEAN AND ALL THE COUNTRIES BORDERING UPON IT EVERY YEAR THEIR SHIPS WENT ROUND THE COASTS FROM ASIA MINOR TO SPAIN ATTACKING AND PLUNDERING CITIES ON THEIR WAY
2289-152254-0024 AND CARRYING OFF PRISONERS ALL THE EFFORTS OF THE ROMANS FAILED TO PUT A STOP TO THESE RAVAGES THE EMPEROR LEO WHO RULED OVER THE EASTERN DIVISION OF THE EMPIRE FITTED OUT A GREAT FLEET AT CONSTANTINOPLE
2289-152254-0025 TO MAKE ANOTHER ATTEMPT TO SUPPRESS THE PIRATES THERE WERE MORE THAN A THOUSAND SHIPS IN THIS FLEET AND THEY CARRIED A HUNDRED THOUSAND MEN
2289-152254-0026 THE BROTHER OF EMPEROR LEO'S WIFE BASILICUS SAILED WITH HIS SHIPS TO AFRICA AND LANDED THE ARMY NOT FAR FROM CARTHAGE GENSERIC ASKED FOR A TRUCE FOR FIVE DAYS TO CONSIDER TERMS OF PEACE AND THE TRUCE WAS GRANTED
2289-152254-0027 BUT THE CUNNING VANDAL WAS NOT THINKING OF PEACE HE ONLY WANTED TIME TO CARRY OUT A PLAN HE HAD MADE TO DESTROY THE ROMAN FLEET ONE DARK NIGHT DURING THE TRUCE HE FILLED THE LARGEST OF HIS SHIPS
2289-152254-0028 IN AMONG THE ROMAN SHIPS TOWING BEHIND THEM LARGE BOATS FILLED WITH MATERIAL THAT WOULD EASILY BURN THESE BOATS WERE SET ON FIRE AND FLOATED AGAINST THE ROMAN VESSELS WHICH ALSO WERE SOON ON FIRE THE FLAMES QUICKLY SPREAD
2289-152254-0029 AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME A GREAT PART OF THE ROMAN FLEET WAS DESTROYED BASILICUS FLED WITH AS MANY SHIPS AS HE COULD SAVE AND RETURNED TO CONSTANTINOPLE THIS WAS THE LAST ATTEMPT OF THE ROMANS TO CONQUER THE VANDALS
2289-152257-0000 IN THE TIME OF CLOVIS THE COUNTRY NOW CALLED BULGARIA WAS INHABITED BY GOTHS ONE DAY A POOR SHEPHERD BOY ABOUT SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE LEFT HIS MOUNTAIN HOME IN THAT COUNTRY TO GO TO THE CITY OF CONSTANTINOPLE WHICH WAS MANY MILES AWAY
2289-152257-0001 BUT HE WAS DETERMINED TO GO EVEN THOUGH HE SHOULD HAVE TO WALK EVERY STEP OF THE ROAD AND LIVE ON FRUITS THAT HE COULD GATHER BY THE WAY HE WAS A BRIGHT CLEVER BOY WHO HAD SPENT HIS LIFE HITHERTO IN A VILLAGE BUT WAS NOW EAGER TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD
2289-152257-0002 TO SEEK HIS FORTUNE SOME YEARS BEFORE THIS BOY'S UNCLE WHO WAS NAMED JUSTIN HAD GONE TO CONSTANTINOPLE AND JOINED THE ROMAN ARMY HE WAS SO BRAVE AND SO GOOD A SOLDIER THAT HE SOON CAME TO BE
2289-152257-0003 COMMANDER OF THE IMPERIAL GUARD WHICH ATTENDED THE EMPEROR THE POOR SHEPHERD BOY HAD HEARD OF THE SUCCESS OF HIS UNCLE AND THIS WAS THE REASON WHY HE RESOLVED TO SET OFF FOR THE BIG CITY SO HE STARTED DOWN THE MOUNTAIN
2289-152257-0004 AND TRUDGED ALONG THE VALLEY IN HIGH HOPE FEELING CERTAIN THAT HE WOULD REACH THE END OF HIS JOURNEY IN SAFETY
2289-152257-0005 AND TO CROSS RIVERS AND HIGH HILLS BUT AT LAST ONE AFTERNOON IN MIDSUMMER HE WALKED THROUGH THE MAIN GATE OF CONSTANTINOPLE PROUD AND HAPPY THAT HE HAD ACCOMPLISHED HIS PURPOSE HE HAD NO TROUBLE IN FINDING HIS UNCLE JUSTIN
2289-152257-0006 AND GAVE HIM THE BEST EDUCATION THAT COULD BE HAD IN THE CITY
2289-152257-0007 RICHLY DRESSED HE WAS WELL LIKED AT THE EMPEROR'S COURT AND WAS RESPECTED BY EVERYBODY ON ACCOUNT OF HIS LEARNING TWO ONE DAY A GREAT CHANGE CAME FOR BOTH UNCLE AND NEPHEW THE EMPEROR DIED
2289-152257-0008 IN RULING THE EMPIRE JUSTINUS AGREED TO THIS PROPOSAL FOR HE WAS NOW OLD AND IN FEEBLE HEALTH AND NOT ABLE HIMSELF TO ATTEND TO THE IMPORTANT AFFAIRS OF GOVERNMENT
2289-152257-0009 JUSTINIAN REIGNED FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS AND DID SO MANY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT HE WAS AFTERWARDS CALLED JUSTINIAN THE GREAT HE HAD MANY WARS DURING HIS REIGN BUT HE HIMSELF DID NOT TAKE PART IN THEM
2289-152257-0010 HE WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH HOWEVER TO HAVE TWO GREAT GENERALS TO LEAD HIS ARMIES ONE OF THEM WAS NAMED BELISARIUS AND THE OTHER NARSES BELISARIUS WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST SOLDIERS THAT EVER LIVED
2289-152257-0011 HE GAINED WONDERFUL VICTORIES FOR JUSTINIAN AND CONQUERED SOME OF THE OLD ROMAN PROVINCES THAT HAD BEEN LOST FOR MANY YEARS THE VICTORIES OF THESE TWO GENERALS LARGELY HELPED TO MAKE THE REIGN OF JUSTINIAN REMARKABLE IN HISTORY
2289-152257-0012 THAT WERE CARRIED ON A FLEET OF SIX HUNDRED SHIPS IT TOOK THIS FLEET THREE MONTHS TO MAKE THE VOYAGE FROM CONSTANTINOPLE TO AFRICA THE SAME VOYAGE MAY NOW BE MADE IN A VERY FEW DAYS BUT IN THE TIME OF BELISARIUS THERE WERE NO STEAMSHIPS
2289-152257-0013 AND NOTHING WAS KNOWN OF THE POWER OF STEAM FOR MOVING MACHINERY THE SHIPS OR GALLEYS WERE SAILING VESSELS AND WHEN THERE WAS NO WIND THEY COULD MAKE NO PROGRESS EXCEPT BY ROWING WHEN BELISARIUS REACHED AFRICA
2289-152257-0014 HE LEFT FIVE MEN AS A GUARD IN EACH VESSEL AND WITH THE BODY OF HIS ARMY HE MARCHED FOR SOME DAYS ALONG THE COAST THE PEOPLE RECEIVED HIM IN A FRIENDLY WAY FOR THEY HAD GROWN TIRED OF THE RULE OF THE VANDALS
2289-152257-0015 AND PREFERRED TO BE UNDER THE GOVERNMENT OF THE ROMANS ABOUT TEN MILES FROM CARTHAGE HE MET A LARGE ARMY LED BY THE BROTHER OF GELIMER A BATTLE IMMEDIATELY TOOK PLACE AND THE VANDALS WERE UTTERLY DEFEATED
2289-152257-0016 GELIMER GAVE HIMSELF UP TO BELISARIUS WHO TOOK HIM TO CONSTANTINOPLE JUSTINIAN SET APART AN ESTATE FOR HIM TO LIVE UPON AND THE CONQUERED KING PASSED THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PEACEFUL RETIREMENT
2289-152257-0017 AFTER CONQUERING THE VANDALS JUSTINIAN RESOLVED TO CONQUER ITALY WHICH WAS THEN HELD BY THE OSTROGOTHS A LARGE ARMY WAS GOT TOGETHER AND PUT UNDER THE COMMAND OF BELISARIUS AND NARSES WHO IMMEDIATELY SET OUT FOR ITALY
2289-152257-0018 WHEN THEY ARRIVED THERE THEY MARCHED STRAIGHT TO ROME AND AFTER SOME FIGHTING
2289-152257-0019 BUT IN A FEW MONTHS VIT'I GES KING OF THE GOTHS APPEARED WITH AN ARMY BEFORE THE GATES AND CHALLENGED BELISARIUS AND NARSES TO COME OUT AND FIGHT THE ROMAN GENERALS HOWEVER
2289-152257-0020 LAID SIEGE TO THE CITY THINKING THAT HE WOULD COMPEL THE ROMANS TO SURRENDER BUT INSTEAD OF HAVING ANY THOUGHT OF SURRENDER BELISARIUS WAS PREPARING HIS MEN FOR FIGHT AND WHEN THEY WERE READY HE ATTACKED VITIGES AND DEFEATED HIM
2289-152257-0021 VITIGES RETIRED TO RAVENNA AND BELISARIUS QUICKLY FOLLOWED AND MADE SUCH AN ASSAULT ON THE CITY THAT IT WAS COMPELLED TO SURRENDER THE OSTROGOTH ARMY WAS CAPTURED
2289-152257-0022 FOR A LONG TIME THE GRANDEST CHURCH STRUCTURE IN THE WORLD THE GREAT TEMPLE STILL EXISTS IN ALL ITS BEAUTY AND GRANDEUR
2289-152257-0023 THE WORK FOR WHICH HE IS MOST CELEBRATED WAS THE IMPROVING AND COLLECTING OF THE LAWS HE MADE MANY EXCELLENT NEW LAWS AND REFORMED MANY OF THE OLD LAWS SO THAT HE BECAME FAMOUS AS ONE OF THE GREATEST OF THE WORLD'S LEGISLATORS
2289-152257-0024 FOR A LONG TIME THE ROMAN LAWS HAD BEEN DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THERE WAS A VAST NUMBER OF THEM AND DIFFERENT WRITERS DIFFERED WIDELY AS TO WHAT THE LAWS REALLY WERE AND WHAT THEY MEANT JUSTINIAN EMPLOYED A GREAT LAWYER NAMED
2289-152257-0025 TRIB O'NI AN TO COLLECT AND SIMPLIFY THE PRINCIPAL LAWS THE COLLECTION WHICH HE MADE WAS CALLED THE CODE OF JUSTINIAN IT STILL EXISTS AND IS THE MODEL ACCORDING TO WHICH MOST OF THE COUNTRIES OF EUROPE HAVE MADE THEIR LAWS
2289-152257-0026 JUSTINIAN ALSO DID A GREAT DEAL OF GOOD BY ESTABLISHING A NUMBER OF MANUFACTURES IN CONSTANTINOPLE IT WAS HE WHO FIRST BROUGHT SILK WORMS INTO EUROPE TO THE LAST YEAR OF HIS LIFE JUSTINIAN WAS STRONG AND ACTIVE
2289-152257-0027 AND A HARD WORKER HE OFTEN WORKED OR STUDIED ALL DAY AND ALL NIGHT WITHOUT EATING OR SLEEPING
2289-152258-0000 A GREAT NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN ASIA AND AFRICA AND MUCH OF THOSE IN TURKEY IN EUROPE PROFESS THE MO HAM'ME DAN RELIGION THEY ARE CALLED MOHAMMEDANS MUS'SUL MANS OR MOSLEMS
2289-152258-0001 AND THE PROPER NAME FOR THEIR RELIGION IS ISLAM WHICH MEANS OBEDIENCE OR SUBMISSION
2289-152258-0002 A CITY OF ARABIA HIS PARENTS WERE POOR PEOPLE THOUGH IT IS SAID THEY WERE DESCENDED FROM ARABIAN PRINCES THEY DIED WHEN MOHAMMED WAS A CHILD
2289-152258-0003 AND BROUGHT HIM UP WHEN THE BOY GREW OLD ENOUGH HE TOOK CARE OF HIS UNCLE'S SHEEP AND CAMELS SOMETIMES HE WENT ON JOURNEYS WITH HIS UNCLE TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF ARABIA TO HELP HIM IN HIS BUSINESS AS A TRADER ON THESE JOURNEYS MOHAMMED USED TO RIDE ON A CAMEL
2289-152258-0004 AND HE SOON BECAME A SKILLFUL CAMEL DRIVER MOHAMMED WAS VERY FAITHFUL AND HONEST IN ALL HIS WORK HE ALWAYS SPOKE THE TRUTH AND NEVER BROKE A PROMISE I HAVE GIVEN MY PROMISE HE WOULD SAY AND I MUST KEEP IT
2289-152258-0005 THAT PEOPLE GAVE HIM THE NAME OF EL AMIN WHICH MEANS THE TRUTHFUL AT THIS TIME HE WAS ONLY SIXTEEN YEARS OF AGE BUT THE RICH TRADERS HAD SO MUCH CONFIDENCE IN HIM THAT THEY GAVE HIM IMPORTANT BUSINESS TO ATTEND TO AND TRUSTED HIM WITH LARGE SUMS OF MONEY
2289-152258-0006 AND SOLD THERE THE GOODS CARRIED BY THE CAMELS
2289-152258-0007 AND FAITHFULLY PAID OVER TO THE OWNERS OF THE GOODS THE MONEY HE HAD RECEIVED MOHAMMED HAD NO SCHOOL EDUCATION HE COULD NEITHER READ NOR WRITE BUT HE WAS NOT IGNORANT HE KNEW WELL HOW TO DO THE WORK INTRUSTED TO HIM AND
2289-152258-0008 THIS WOMAN WAS A WIDOW WHO WAS CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS LEFT HER BY HER HUSBAND AS SOON AS THE CAMEL DRIVER SAW MOHAMMED HE STOPPED HIM AND SAID MY MISTRESS WISHES TO SEE YOU BEFORE NOON I THINK SHE INTENDS TO ENGAGE YOU TO TAKE CHARGE OF HER CARAVANS
2289-152258-0009 AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HE WENT TO THE HOUSE OF KHADIJAH FOR HE WAS WELL PLEASED AT THE THOUGHT OF BEING EMPLOYED IN SO IMPORTANT A SERVICE
2289-152258-0010 SHE SAID I HAVE HEARD MUCH OF YOU AMONG THE TRADERS
2289-152258-0011 ARE YOU WILLING TO TAKE CHARGE OF MY CARAVANS AND GIVE YOUR WHOLE TIME AND SERVICE TO ME MOHAMMED WAS DELIGHTED
2289-152258-0012 KHADIJAH THEN ENGAGED HIM AS THE MANAGER OF HER BUSINESS AND HE SERVED HER WELL AND FAITHFULLY SHE THOUGHT A GREAT DEAL OF HIM
2289-152258-0013 AND SOON THEY CAME TO LOVE ONE ANOTHER AND WERE MARRIED AS HE WAS NOW THE HUSBAND OF A RICH WOMAN HE DID NOT NEED TO WORK VERY HARD HE STILL CONTINUED TO ATTEND TO HIS WIFE'S BUSINESS BUT HE DID NOT MAKE SO MANY JOURNEYS AS BEFORE
2289-152258-0014 AND CHRISTIANITY BUT HE WAS NOT SATISFIED WITH EITHER OF THEM
2289-152258-0015 WORSHIPED IDOLS VERY FEW OF THEM WERE CHRISTIANS
2289-152258-0016 IN A CAVE ON MOUNT HIRA NEAR MECCA HE SPENT SEVERAL WEEKS EVERY YEAR IN PRAYER AND RELIGIOUS MEDITATION HE DECLARED THAT WHILE PRAYING IN HIS CAVE HE OFTEN HAD VISIONS OF GOD AND HEAVEN
2289-152258-0017 HE SAID THAT MANY TIMES THE ANGEL GABRIEL APPEARED TO HIM AND REVEALED TO HIM THE RELIGION WHICH HE AFTERWARDS TAUGHT HIS FOLLOWERS AS HE HIMSELF COULD NOT WRITE HE COMMITTED TO MEMORY ALL THAT THE ANGEL TOLD HIM AND HAD IT WRITTEN IN A BOOK
2289-152258-0018 THIS BOOK IS CALLED THE KORAN WHICH MEANS LIKE OUR OWN WORD BIBLE THE BOOK
2289-152258-0019 THREE WHEN MOHAMMED RETURNED HOME AFTER THE ANGEL HAD FIRST SPOKEN TO HIM HE TOLD HIS WIFE OF WHAT HE HAD SEEN AND HEARD SHE AT ONCE BELIEVED AND SO BECAME A CONVERT TO THE NEW RELIGION
2289-152258-0020 SHE FELL UPON HER KNEES AT THE FEET OF HER HUSBAND AND CRIED OUT THERE IS BUT ONE GOD MOHAMMED IS GOD'S PROPHET MOHAMMED THEN TOLD THE STORY TO OTHER MEMBERS OF HIS FAMILY SOME OF THEM BELIEVED AND BECAME HIS FIRST FOLLOWERS
2289-152258-0021 SOON AFTERWARDS HE BEGAN TO PREACH TO THE PEOPLE HE SPOKE IN THE MARKET AND OTHER PUBLIC PLACES
2289-152258-0022 LAUGHED AT WHAT HE TOLD THEM BUT SOME POOR PEOPLE AND A FEW SLAVES BELIEVED HIM AND ADOPTED THE NEW RELIGION OTHERS SAID HE WAS A DREAMER AND A FOOL MOHAMMED HOWEVER PAID NO HEED TO THE INSULTS HE RECEIVED
2289-152258-0023 HE WENT ON TELLING ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF GABRIEL AND PREACHING THE DOCTRINES WHICH HE SAID THE ANGEL HAD ORDERED HIM TO TEACH THE PEOPLE
2289-152258-0024 AT SUCH TIMES HIS FACE GREW PALE AS DEATH HIS EYES BECAME RED AND STARING HE SPOKE IN A LOUD VOICE AND HIS BODY TREMBLED VIOLENTLY THEN HE WOULD TELL WHAT HE HAD SEEN IN HIS VISION
2289-152258-0025 PEOPLE CAME FROM DISTANT PARTS OF ARABIA AND FROM NEIGHBORING COUNTRIES TO HEAR HIM ONE DAY SIX OF THE CHIEF MEN OF ME DI'NA
2289-152258-0026 ABOUT THIS TIME MOHAMMED'S UNCLE AND WIFE DIED AND HE HAD THEN HARDLY ANY FRIENDS IN MECCA HE THEREFORE RESOLVED TO LEAVE THAT CITY AND GO TO MEDINA NUMBERS OF THE PEOPLE THERE BELIEVED HIS DOCTRINES
2289-152258-0027 AND WISHED HIM TO COME AND LIVE AMONG THEM SO HE SECRETLY LEFT HIS NATIVE TOWN AND FLED FROM HIS ENEMIES WITH A FEW FAITHFUL COMPANIONS HE MADE HIS ESCAPE TO MEDINA
2289-152258-0028 THAT MOHAMMED FLED FROM MECCA THIS EVENT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MOHAMMEDAN HISTORY IT IS CALLED THE FLIGHT OF THE PROPHET OR THE HEJ'I RA
2289-152258-0029 THE REMAINDER OF HIS LIFE A SPLENDID CHURCH WAS BUILT FOR HIM IN MEDINA IT WAS CALLED A MOSQUE AND ALL MOHAMMEDAN CHURCHES OR PLACES OF WORSHIP
2289-152258-0030 HE GAINED MANY VICTORIES HE MARCHED AGAINST MECCA WITH AN ARMY OF TEN THOUSAND MEN AND THE CITY SURRENDERED WITH LITTLE RESISTANCE THE PEOPLE THEN JOINED HIS RELIGION AND DESTROYED THEIR IDOLS
2289-152258-0031 HE WAS BURIED IN THE MOSQUE IN WHICH HE HAD HELD RELIGIOUS SERVICES FOR SO MANY YEARS
2289-152258-0032 THAT THE BODY STILL LIES IN THE COFFIN IN THE SAME STATE AS WHEN IT WAS FIRST BURIED
2289-152258-0033 THAT THE COFFIN OF MOHAMMED RESTS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN HEAVEN AND EARTH SUSPENDED IN THE AIR BUT THIS FABLE WAS INVENTED BY ENEMIES TO BRING RIDICULE ON THE PROPHET AND HIS RELIGION
2289-152258-0034 EVERY MUSSULMAN IS BOUND BY HIS RELIGION TO MAKE A VISIT OR PILGRIMAGE TO MECCA AT LEAST ONCE IN HIS LIFE
2289-152258-0035 OF THE MOSQUE AND CHANTING IN A LOUD VOICE SUCH WORDS AS THESE COME TO PRAYER COME TO PRAYER THERE IS NO GOD BUT GOD HE GIVETH LIFE AND HE DIETH NOT I PRAISE HIS PERFECTION GOD IS GREAT IN MECCA
2289-152258-0036 THERE IS A MOSQUE CALLED THE GREAT MOSQUE IT IS A LARGE ENCLOSURE IN THE FORM OF A QUADRANGLE OR SQUARE
2289-152258-0037 IT ITS WALL AT ONE CORNER IS THE CELEBRATED BLACK STONE MOSLEMS REGARD THIS STONE WITH THE GREATEST REVERENCE THEY SAY THAT IT CAME DOWN FROM HEAVEN IT IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN ONCE WHITE
2289-152258-0038 BUT HAS BECOME DARK FROM BEING WEPT UPON AND TOUCHED BY SO MANY MILLIONS OF PILGRIMS IT REALLY IS REDDISH BROWN IN COLOR BEFORE THE TIME OF MOHAMMED THE KA'A BA WAS A PAGAN TEMPLE
2289-152258-0039 BUT WHEN HE TOOK POSSESSION OF MECCA HE MADE THE OLD TEMPLE THE CENTRE OF WORSHIP FOR HIS OWN RELIGION AFTER MOHAMMED DIED A PERSON WAS APPOINTED TO BE HIS SUCCESSOR AS HEAD OF THE MOSLEM CHURCH
2289-152258-0040 AND THIS TITLE HAS BEEN BORNE EVER SINCE BY THE RELIGIOUS CHIEF OF THE MOHAMMEDANS IN MODERN TIMES THE SULTANS OR RULERS OF TURKEY
229-130880-0000 RIGHT OFF I OBSERVED A CLUSTER OF MOUNTAINS ABOUT TWO THOUSAND FEET HIGH WHOSE SHAPES WERE VERY WHIMSICALLY SCULPTED AFTER OUR POSITION FIX I REENTERED THE LOUNGE AND WHEN OUR BEARINGS WERE REPORTED ON THE CHART I SAW THAT WE WERE OFF THE ISLAND OF CEYLON
229-130880-0001 THAT PEARL DANGLING FROM THE LOWER LOBE OF THE INDIAN PENINSULA I WENT LOOKING IN THE LIBRARY FOR A BOOK ABOUT THIS ISLAND ONE OF THE MOST FERTILE IN THE WORLD SURE ENOUGH I FOUND A VOLUME ENTITLED CEYLON AND THE SINGHALESE
229-130880-0002 REENTERING THE LOUNGE I FIRST NOTED THE BEARINGS OF CEYLON ON WHICH ANTIQUITY LAVISHED SO MANY DIFFERENT NAMES
229-130880-0003 ITS LENGTH IS TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE MILES ITS MAXIMUM WIDTH ONE HUNDRED FIFTY MILES ITS CIRCUMFERENCE NINE HUNDRED MILES ITS SURFACE AREA TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT SQUARE MILES
229-130880-0004 IN OTHER WORDS A LITTLE SMALLER THAN THAT OF IRELAND JUST THEN CAPTAIN NEMO AND HIS CHIEF OFFICER APPEARED THE CAPTAIN GLANCED AT THE CHART THEN TURNING TO ME THE ISLAND OF CEYLON HE SAID
229-130880-0005 IS FAMOUS FOR ITS PEARL FISHERIES WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED PROFESSOR ARONNAX
229-130880-0006 CERTAINLY CAPTAIN FINE IT'S EASILY DONE ONLY WHEN WE SEE THE FISHERIES WE'LL SEE NO FISHERMEN
229-130880-0007 AND WE'LL ARRIVE THERE LATE TONIGHT
229-130880-0008 WHO WENT OUT IMMEDIATELY SOON THE NAUTILUS REENTERED ITS LIQUID ELEMENT AND THE PRESSURE GAUGE INDICATED THAT IT WAS STAYING AT A DEPTH OF THIRTY FEET WITH THE CHART UNDER MY EYES
229-130880-0009 I FOUND IT BY THE NINTH PARALLEL OFF THE NORTHWESTERN SHORES OF CEYLON
229-130880-0010 TO REACH IT WE HAD TO GO ALL THE WAY UP CEYLON'S WEST COAST PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO THEN TOLD ME THERE ARE PEARL FISHERIES IN THE BAY OF BENGAL THE SEAS OF THE EAST INDIES
229-130880-0011 THE SEAS OF CHINA AND JAPAN PLUS THOSE SEAS SOUTH OF THE UNITED STATES THE GULF OF PANAMA AND THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S OFF CEYLON THAT SUCH FISHING REAPS ITS RICHEST REWARDS NO DOUBT WE'LL BE ARRIVING A LITTLE EARLY
229-130880-0012 ONLY DURING THE MONTH OF MARCH AND FOR THIRTY DAYS SOME THREE HUNDRED BOATS CONCENTRATE ON THE LUCRATIVE HARVEST OF THESE TREASURES FROM THE SEA EACH BOAT IS MANNED BY TEN OARSMEN AND TEN FISHERMEN THE LATTER DIVIDE INTO TWO GROUPS
229-130880-0013 DIVE IN ROTATION AND DESCEND TO A DEPTH OF TWELVE METERS WITH THE HELP OF A HEAVY STONE CLUTCHED BETWEEN THEIR FEET AND ATTACHED BY A ROPE TO THEIR BOAT YOU MEAN I SAID
229-130880-0014 THAT SUCH PRIMITIVE METHODS ARE STILL ALL THAT THEY USE ALL
229-130880-0015 ALTHOUGH THESE FISHERIES BELONG TO THE MOST INDUSTRIALIZED PEOPLE IN THE WORLD THE ENGLISH
229-130880-0016 YET IT STRIKES ME THAT DIVING SUITS LIKE YOURS COULD PERFORM YEOMAN SERVICE IN SUCH WORK YES SINCE THOSE POOR FISHERMEN CAN'T STAY LONG UNDERWATER ON HIS VOYAGE TO CEYLON
229-130880-0017 THE ENGLISHMAN PERCIVAL MADE MUCH OF A KAFFIR WHO STAYED UNDER FIVE MINUTES WITHOUT COMING UP TO THE SURFACE BUT I FIND THAT HARD TO BELIEVE
229-130880-0018 I KNOW THAT SOME DIVERS CAN LAST UP TO FIFTY SEVEN SECONDS AND HIGHLY SKILLFUL ONES TO EIGHTY SEVEN BUT SUCH MEN ARE RARE
229-130880-0019 I BELIEVE THE AVERAGE TIME UNDERWATER THAT THESE FISHERMEN CAN TOLERATE IS THIRTY SECONDS DURING WHICH THEY HASTILY STUFF THEIR LITTLE NETS WITH ALL THE PEARL OYSTERS THEY CAN TEAR LOOSE
229-130880-0020 THEIR VISION WEAKENS ULCERS BREAK OUT ON THEIR EYES SORES FORM ON THEIR BODIES AND SOME ARE EVEN STRICKEN WITH APOPLEXY ON THE OCEAN FLOOR YES I SAID IT'S A SAD OCCUPATION
229-130880-0021 AND ONE THAT EXISTS ONLY TO GRATIFY THE WHIMS OF FASHION BUT TELL ME CAPTAIN HOW MANY OYSTERS CAN A BOAT FISH UP IN A WORKDAY
229-130880-0022 IT'S EVEN SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN FOURTEEN WHEN THE ENGLISH GOVERNMENT WENT FISHING ON ITS OWN BEHALF ITS DIVERS WORKED JUST TWENTY DAYS AND BROUGHT UP SEVENTY SIX MILLION OYSTERS
229-130880-0023 THE FISHERMEN ARE WELL PAID AREN'T THEY HARDLY PROFESSOR IN PANAMA THEY MAKE JUST ONE DOLLAR PER WEEK IN MOST PLACES THEY EARN ONLY A PENNY FOR EACH OYSTER THAT HAS A PEARL AND THEY BRING UP SO MANY THAT HAVE NONE
229-130880-0024 ONLY ONE PENNY TO THOSE POOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE THEIR EMPLOYERS RICH THAT'S ATROCIOUS ON THAT NOTE PROFESSOR CAPTAIN NEMO TOLD ME
229-130880-0025 AND IF BY CHANCE SOME EAGER FISHERMAN ARRIVES EARLY WELL WE CAN WATCH HIM AT WORK THAT SUITS ME CAPTAIN BY THE WAY PROFESSOR ARONNAX YOU AREN'T AFRAID OF SHARKS ARE YOU SHARKS I EXCLAIMED
229-130880-0026 THIS STRUCK ME AS A PRETTY NEEDLESS QUESTION TO SAY THE LEAST WELL CAPTAIN NEMO WENT ON I ADMIT CAPTAIN I'M NOT YET ON VERY FAMILIAR TERMS WITH THAT GENUS OF FISH WE'RE USED TO THEM
229-130880-0027 THE REST OF US CAPTAIN NEMO ANSWERED AND IN TIME YOU WILL BE TOO ANYHOW WE'LL BE ARMED AND ON OUR WAY WE MIGHT HUNT A MAN EATER OR TWO IT'S A FASCINATING SPORT SO PROFESSOR I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW
229-130880-0028 BRIGHT AND EARLY THIS SAID IN A CAREFREE TONE CAPTAIN NEMO LEFT THE LOUNGE IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT BEARS IN THE SWISS MOUNTAINS YOU MIGHT SAY OH GOOD I GET TO GO BEAR HUNTING TOMORROW
229-130880-0029 IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT LIONS ON THE ATLAS PLAINS OR TIGERS IN THE JUNGLES OF INDIA YOU MIGHT SAY HA NOW'S MY CHANCE TO HUNT LIONS AND TIGERS BUT IF YOU'RE INVITED TO HUNT SHARKS IN THEIR NATIVE ELEMENT
229-130880-0030 YOU MIGHT WANT TO THINK IT OVER BEFORE ACCEPTING AS FOR ME I PASSED A HAND OVER MY BROW WHERE BEADS OF COLD SWEAT WERE BUSY FORMING LET'S THINK THIS OVER I SAID TO MYSELF AND LET'S TAKE OUR TIME
229-130880-0031 HUNTING OTTERS IN UNDERWATER FORESTS AS WE DID IN THE FORESTS OF CRESPO ISLAND IS AN ACCEPTABLE ACTIVITY
229-130880-0032 THAT'S ANOTHER STORY I KNOW THAT IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES PARTICULARLY THE ANDAMAN ISLANDS NEGROES DON'T HESITATE TO ATTACK SHARKS DAGGER IN ONE HAND AND NOOSE IN THE OTHER
229-130880-0033 BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT MANY WHO FACE THOSE FEARSOME ANIMALS DON'T COME BACK ALIVE BESIDES I'M NOT A NEGRO AND EVEN IF I WERE A NEGRO IN THIS INSTANCE I DON'T THINK A LITTLE HESITATION ON MY PART WOULD BE OUT OF PLACE
229-130880-0034 AND THERE I WAS FANTASIZING ABOUT SHARKS ENVISIONING HUGE JAWS ARMED WITH MULTIPLE ROWS OF TEETH AND CAPABLE OF CUTTING A MAN IN HALF I COULD ALREADY FEEL A DEFINITE PAIN AROUND MY PELVIC GIRDLE
229-130880-0035 AND HOW I RESENTED THE OFFHAND MANNER IN WHICH THE CAPTAIN HAD EXTENDED HIS DEPLORABLE INVITATION
229-130880-0036 THANK HEAVENS I SAID TO MYSELF CONSEIL WILL NEVER WANT TO COME ALONG AND THAT'LL BE MY EXCUSE FOR NOT GOING WITH THE CAPTAIN AS FOR NED LAND I ADMIT I FELT LESS CONFIDENT OF HIS WISDOM
229-130880-0037 DANGER HOWEVER GREAT HELD A PERENNIAL ATTRACTION FOR HIS AGGRESSIVE NATURE I WENT BACK TO READING SIRR'S BOOK BUT I LEAFED THROUGH IT MECHANICALLY BETWEEN THE LINES I KEPT SEEING FEARSOME WIDE OPEN JAWS
229-130880-0038 JUST THEN CONSEIL AND THE CANADIAN ENTERED WITH A CALM EVEN GLEEFUL AIR LITTLE DID THEY KNOW WHAT WAS WAITING FOR THEM YE GODS SIR NED LAND TOLD ME YOUR CAPTAIN NEMO THE DEVIL TAKE HIM
229-130880-0039 HAS JUST MADE US A VERY PLEASANT PROPOSITION OH I SAID YOU KNOW ABOUT WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO MASTER CONSEIL REPLIED THE NAUTILUS'S COMMANDER HAS INVITED US TOGETHER WITH MASTER
229-130880-0040 FOR A VISIT TOMORROW TO CEYLON'S MAGNIFICENT PEARL FISHERIES HE DID SO IN THE MOST CORDIAL TERMS AND CONDUCTED HIMSELF LIKE A TRUE GENTLEMAN HE DIDN'T TELL YOU ANYTHING ELSE NOTHING SIR THE CANADIAN REPLIED
229-130880-0041 HE SAID YOU'D ALREADY DISCUSSED THIS LITTLE STROLL INDEED I SAID BUT DIDN'T HE GIVE YOU ANY DETAILS ON NOT A ONE MISTER NATURALIST YOU WILL BE GOING WITH US RIGHT ME
229-130880-0042 WHY YES CERTAINLY OF COURSE I CAN SEE THAT YOU LIKE THE IDEA MISTER LAND YES IT WILL BE A REALLY UNUSUAL EXPERIENCE AND POSSIBLY DANGEROUS I ADDED IN AN INSINUATING TONE
229-130880-0043 DANGEROUS NED LAND REPLIED A SIMPLE TRIP TO AN OYSTERBANK ASSUREDLY
229-130880-0044 FOR MY PART I STARED AT THEM WITH ANXIOUS EYES AS IF THEY WERE ALREADY MISSING A LIMB OR TWO SHOULD I ALERT THEM YES SURELY BUT I HARDLY KNEW HOW TO GO ABOUT IT WOULD MASTER
229-130880-0045 CONSEIL SAID TO ME GIVE US SOME BACKGROUND ON PEARL FISHING ON THE FISHING ITSELF I ASKED OR ON THE OCCUPATIONAL HAZARDS THAT ON THE FISHING THE CANADIAN REPLIED BEFORE WE TACKLE THE TERRAIN IT HELPS TO BE FAMILIAR WITH IT
229-130880-0046 ALL RIGHT SIT DOWN MY FRIENDS
229-130880-0047 NED AND CONSEIL TOOK SEATS ON A COUCH AND RIGHT OFF THE CANADIAN SAID TO ME SIR JUST WHAT IS A PEARL EXACTLY MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED FOR POETS A PEARL IS A TEAR FROM THE SEA
229-130880-0048 FOR ORIENTALS IT'S A DROP OF SOLIDIFIED DEW FOR THE LADIES IT'S A JEWEL
229-130880-0049 NECKS AND EARS THAT'S OBLONG IN SHAPE GLASSY IN LUSTER AND FORMED FROM MOTHER OF PEARL FOR CHEMISTS IT'S A MIXTURE OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATE AND CALCIUM CARBONATE WITH A LITTLE GELATIN PROTEIN
229-130880-0050 AND FINALLY FOR NATURALISTS IT'S A SIMPLE FESTERING SECRETION FROM THE ORGAN THAT PRODUCES MOTHER OF PEARL IN CERTAIN BIVALVES BRANCH MOLLUSCA CONSEIL SAID CLASS
229-130880-0051 ACEPHALA ORDER TESTACEA CORRECT MY SCHOLARLY CONSEIL NOW THEN THOSE TESTACEA CAPABLE OF PRODUCING PEARLS INCLUDE RAINBOW ABALONE
229-130880-0052 TURBO SNAILS GIANT CLAMS AND SALTWATER SCALLOPS BRIEFLY ALL THOSE THAT SECRETE MOTHER OF PEARL IN OTHER WORDS THAT BLUE AZURE VIOLET OR WHITE SUBSTANCE
229-130880-0053 LINING THE INSIDES OF THEIR VALVES ARE MUSSELS INCLUDED TOO THE CANADIAN ASKED YES THE MUSSELS OF CERTAIN STREAMS IN SCOTLAND WALES IRELAND SAXONY BOHEMIA AND FRANCE
229-130880-0054 GOOD THE CANADIAN REPLIED FROM NOW ON WE'LL PAY CLOSER ATTENTION TO EM BUT I WENT ON FOR SECRETING PEARLS THE IDEAL MOLLUSK IS THE PEARL OYSTER MELEAGRINA MARGARITIFERA
229-130880-0055 THAT VALUABLE SHELLFISH PEARLS RESULT SIMPLY FROM MOTHER OF PEARL SOLIDIFYING INTO A GLOBULAR SHAPE EITHER THEY STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL OR THEY BECOME EMBEDDED IN THE CREATURE'S FOLDS
229-130880-0056 ON THE VALVES A PEARL STICKS FAST ON THE FLESH IT LIES LOOSE BUT ITS NUCLEUS IS ALWAYS SOME SMALL HARD OBJECT SAY A STERILE EGG OR A GRAIN OF SAND
229-130880-0057 AROUND WHICH THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS DEPOSITED IN THIN CONCENTRIC LAYERS OVER SEVERAL YEARS IN SUCCESSION CAN ONE FIND SEVERAL PEARLS IN THE SAME OYSTER CONSEIL ASKED YES MY BOY
229-130880-0058 THEY EVEN MENTION ONE OYSTER ABOUT WHICH I REMAIN DUBIOUS
229-130880-0059 NED LAND YELPED DID I SAY SHARKS I EXCLAIMED HASTILY I MEANT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY PEARLS SHARKS WOULDN'T MAKE SENSE INDEED CONSEIL SAID
229-130880-0060 BUT WILL MASTER NOW TELL US HOW ONE GOES ABOUT EXTRACTING THESE PEARLS ONE PROCEEDS IN SEVERAL WAYS AND OFTEN WHEN PEARLS STICK TO THE VALVES FISHERMEN EVEN PULL THEM LOOSE WITH PLIERS
229-130880-0061 THUS THEY DIE IN THE OPEN AIR AND BY THE END OF TEN DAYS THEY'VE ROTTED SUFFICIENTLY NEXT THEY'RE IMMERSED IN HUGE TANKS OF SALT WATER THEN THEY'RE OPENED UP AND WASHED AT THIS POINT THE SORTERS BEGIN THEIR TWOFOLD TASK
229-130880-0062 FIRST THEY REMOVE THE LAYERS OF MOTHER OF PEARL WHICH ARE KNOWN IN THE INDUSTRY BY THE NAMES LEGITIMATE SILVER BASTARD WHITE OR BASTARD BLACK
229-130880-0063 THEN THEY REMOVE THE OYSTER'S MEATY TISSUE BOIL IT AND FINALLY STRAIN IT IN ORDER TO EXTRACT EVEN THE SMALLEST PEARLS DO THE PRICES OF THESE PEARLS DIFFER DEPENDING ON THEIR SIZE CONSEIL ASKED NOT ONLY ON THEIR SIZE I REPLIED
229-130880-0064 BUT ALSO ACCORDING TO THEIR SHAPE THEIR WATER IN OTHER WORDS THEIR COLOR AND THEIR ORIENT IN OTHER WORDS THAT DAPPLED SHIMMERING GLOW THAT MAKES THEM SO DELIGHTFUL TO THE EYE THE FINEST PEARLS ARE CALLED VIRGIN PEARLS OR PARAGONS
229-130880-0065 THEY FORM IN ISOLATION WITHIN THE MOLLUSK'S TISSUE THEY'RE WHITE OFTEN OPAQUE BUT SOMETIMES OF OPALESCENT TRANSPARENCY AND USUALLY SPHERICAL OR PEAR SHAPED THE SPHERICAL ONES ARE MADE INTO BRACELETS
229-130880-0066 THE PEAR SHAPED ONES INTO EARRINGS AND SINCE THEY'RE THE MOST VALUABLE THEY'RE PRICED INDIVIDUALLY THE OTHER PEARLS THAT STICK TO THE OYSTER'S SHELL ARE MORE ERRATICALLY SHAPED AND ARE PRICED BY WEIGHT FINALLY CLASSED IN THE LOWEST ORDER
229-130880-0067 THE SMALLEST PEARLS ARE KNOWN BY THE NAME SEED PEARLS THEY'RE PRICED BY THE MEASURING CUP AND ARE USED MAINLY IN THE CREATION OF EMBROIDERY FOR CHURCH VESTMENTS BUT IT MUST BE A LONG HARD JOB SORTING OUT THESE PEARLS BY SIZE
229-130880-0068 THE CANADIAN SAID NO MY FRIEND THAT TASK IS PERFORMED WITH ELEVEN STRAINERS OR SIEVES THAT ARE PIERCED WITH DIFFERENT NUMBERS OF HOLES THOSE PEARLS STAYING IN THE STRAINERS WITH TWENTY TO EIGHTY HOLES ARE IN THE FIRST ORDER
229-130880-0069 THOSE NOT SLIPPING THROUGH THE SIEVES PIERCED WITH ONE HUNDRED TO EIGHT HUNDRED HOLES ARE IN THE SECOND ORDER FINALLY THOSE PEARLS FOR WHICH ONE USES STRAINERS PIERCED WITH NINE HUNDRED TO ONE THOUSAND HOLES MAKE UP THE SEED PEARLS
229-130880-0070 HOW INGENIOUS CONSEIL SAID TO REDUCE DIVIDING AND CLASSIFYING PEARLS TO A MECHANICAL OPERATION AND COULD MASTER TELL US THE PROFITS BROUGHT IN BY HARVESTING THESE BANKS OF PEARL OYSTERS ACCORDING TO SIRR'S BOOK I REPLIED
229-130880-0071 THESE CEYLON FISHERIES ARE FARMED ANNUALLY FOR A TOTAL PROFIT OF THREE MILLION MAN EATERS FRANCS CONSEIL REBUKED YES FRANCS THREE MILLION FRANCS I WENT ON
229-130880-0072 BUT I DON'T THINK THESE FISHERIES BRING IN THE RETURNS THEY ONCE DID SIMILARLY THE CENTRAL AMERICAN FISHERIES
229-130880-0073 BUT NOW THEY BRING IN ONLY TWO THIRDS OF THAT AMOUNT ALL IN ALL IT'S ESTIMATED THAT NINE MILLION FRANCS IS THE CURRENT YEARLY RETURN FOR THE WHOLE PEARL HARVESTING INDUSTRY BUT CONSEIL ASKED
229-130880-0074 HAVEN'T CERTAIN FAMOUS PEARLS BEEN QUOTED AT EXTREMELY HIGH PRICES YES MY BOY
229-130880-0075 I'VE EVEN HEARD STORIES THE CANADIAN SAID ABOUT SOME LADY IN ANCIENT TIMES WHO DRANK PEARLS IN VINEGAR CLEOPATRA CONSEIL SHOT BACK IT MUST HAVE TASTED PRETTY BAD NED LAND ADDED ABOMINABLE NED MY FRIEND
229-130880-0076 CONSEIL REPLIED BUT WHEN A LITTLE GLASS OF VINEGAR IS WORTH ONE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND FRANCS ITS TASTE IS A SMALL PRICE TO PAY
229-130880-0077 NED LAND MARRIED TO CLEOPATRA CONSEIL EXCLAIMED BUT I WAS ALL SET TO TIE THE KNOT CONSEIL THE CANADIAN REPLIED IN ALL SERIOUSNESS
229-130880-0078 I EVEN BOUGHT A PEARL NECKLACE FOR MY FIANCEE KATE TENDER BUT SHE MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE INSTEAD
229-130880-0079 BUT YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY TRUST ME ON THIS PROFESSOR ITS PEARLS WERE SO BIG
229-130880-0080 MY GALLANT NED I REPLIED LAUGHING THOSE WERE ARTIFICIAL PEARLS ORDINARY GLASS BEADS WHOSE INSIDES WERE COATED WITH ESSENCE OF ORIENT WOW
229-130880-0081 THAT ESSENCE OF ORIENT MUST SELL FOR QUITE A LARGE SUM AS LITTLE AS ZERO IT COMES FROM THE SCALES OF A EUROPEAN CARP IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN A SILVER SUBSTANCE THAT COLLECTS IN THE WATER AND IS PRESERVED IN AMMONIA IT'S WORTHLESS
229-130880-0082 MAYBE THAT'S WHY KATE TENDER MARRIED SOMEBODY ELSE REPLIED MISTER LAND PHILOSOPHICALLY BUT I SAID GETTING BACK TO PEARLS OF GREAT VALUE I DON'T THINK ANY SOVEREIGN EVER POSSESSED ONE SUPERIOR TO THE PEARL OWNED BY CAPTAIN NEMO
229-130880-0083 THIS ONE CONSEIL SAID POINTING TO A MAGNIFICENT JEWEL IN ITS GLASS CASE EXACTLY AND I'M CERTAINLY NOT FAR OFF WHEN I ESTIMATE ITS VALUE AT TWO MILLION UH FRANCS
229-130880-0084 CONSEIL SAID QUICKLY YES I SAID TWO MILLION FRANCS AND NO DOUBT ALL IT COST OUR CAPTAIN WAS THE EFFORT TO PICK IT UP HA NED LAND EXCLAIMED DURING OUR STROLL TOMORROW WHO SAYS WE WON'T RUN INTO ONE JUST LIKE IT
229-130880-0085 CONSEIL PUT IN AND WHY NOT WHAT GOOD WOULD A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS DO US HERE ON THE NAUTILUS HERE NO NED LAND SAID BUT ELSEWHERE OH ELSEWHERE CONSEIL PUT IN
229-130880-0086 SHAKING HIS HEAD IN FACT I SAID MISTER LAND IS RIGHT AND IF WE EVER BROUGHT BACK TO EUROPE OR AMERICA A PEARL WORTH MILLIONS IT WOULD MAKE THE STORY OF OUR ADVENTURES MORE AUTHENTIC AND MUCH MORE REWARDING THAT'S HOW I SEE IT
229-130880-0087 THE CANADIAN SAID BUT SAID CONSEIL WHO PERPETUALLY RETURNED TO THE DIDACTIC SIDE OF THINGS IS THIS PEARL FISHING EVER DANGEROUS NO I REPLIED QUICKLY ESPECIALLY IF ONE TAKES CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS
229-130880-0088 WHAT RISKS WOULD YOU RUN IN A JOB LIKE THAT NED LAND SAID SWALLOWING A FEW GULPS OF SALT WATER WHATEVER YOU SAY NED THEN TRYING TO IMITATE CAPTAIN NEMO'S CAREFREE TONE I ASKED
229-130880-0089 BY THE WAY GALLANT NED ARE YOU AFRAID OF SHARKS
229-130880-0090 THE CANADIAN REPLIED I'M A PROFESSIONAL HARPOONER IT'S MY JOB TO MAKE A MOCKERY OF THEM IT ISN'T AN ISSUE I SAID OF FISHING FOR THEM WITH A SWIVEL HOOK HOISTING THEM ONTO THE DECK OF A SHIP
229-130880-0091 OPENING THE BELLY RIPPING OUT THE HEART AND TOSSING IT INTO THE SEA SO IT'S AN ISSUE OF YES PRECISELY IN THE WATER IN THE WATER YE GODS JUST GIVE ME A GOOD HARPOON
229-130880-0092 YOU SEE SIR THESE SHARKS ARE BADLY DESIGNED THEY HAVE TO ROLL THEIR BELLIES OVER TO SNAP YOU UP AND IN THE MEANTIME NED LAND HAD A WAY OF PRONOUNCING THE WORD SNAP
229-130880-0093 WELL HOW ABOUT YOU CONSEIL WHAT ARE YOUR FEELINGS ABOUT THESE MAN EATERS ME CONSEIL SAID I'M AFRAID I MUST BE FRANK WITH MASTER GOOD FOR YOU I THOUGHT
233-134440-0000 IF YOU HAVE LIVED IN CITIES AND HAVE WALKED IN THE PARK ON A SUMMER AFTERNOON YOU HAVE PERHAPS SEEN BLINKING IN A CORNER OF HIS IRON CAGE
233-134440-0001 A HUGE GROTESQUE KIND OF MONKEY A CREATURE WITH UGLY SAGGING HAIRLESS SKIN BELOW HIS EYES AND A BRIGHT PURPLE UNDERBODY THIS MONKEY IS A TRUE MONSTER
233-134440-0002 IN THE COMPLETENESS OF HIS UGLINESS HE ACHIEVED A KIND OF PERVERTED BEAUTY CHILDREN STOPPING BEFORE THE CAGE ARE FASCINATED MEN TURN AWAY WITH AN AIR OF DISGUST AND WOMEN LINGER FOR A MOMENT
233-134440-0003 TRYING PERHAPS TO REMEMBER WHICH ONE OF THEIR MALE ACQUAINTANCES THE THING IN SOME FAINT WAY RESEMBLES HAD YOU BEEN IN THE EARLIER YEARS OF YOUR LIFE A CITIZEN OF THE VILLAGE OF WINESBURG OHIO
233-134440-0004 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR YOU NO MYSTERY IN REGARD TO THE BEAST IN HIS CAGE IT IS LIKE WASH WILLIAMS YOU WOULD HAVE SAID AS HE SITS IN THE CORNER THERE THE BEAST IS EXACTLY LIKE OLD WASH
233-134440-0005 SITTING ON THE GRASS IN THE STATION YARD ON A SUMMER EVENING AFTER HE HAS CLOSED HIS OFFICE FOR THE NIGHT WASH WILLIAMS THE TELEGRAPH OPERATOR OF WINESBURG WAS THE UGLIEST THING IN TOWN HIS GIRTH WAS IMMENSE
233-134440-0006 HIS NECK THIN HIS LEGS FEEBLE HE WAS DIRTY EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM WAS UNCLEAN EVEN THE WHITES OF HIS EYES LOOKED SOILED I GO TOO FAST NOT EVERYTHING ABOUT WASH WAS UNCLEAN
233-134440-0007 HE TOOK CARE OF HIS HANDS HIS FINGERS WERE FAT BUT THERE WAS SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND SHAPELY IN THE HAND THAT LAY ON THE TABLE BY THE INSTRUMENT IN THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE IN HIS YOUTH
233-134440-0008 WASH WILLIAMS HAD BEEN CALLED THE BEST TELEGRAPH OPERATOR IN THE STATE AND IN SPITE OF HIS DEGRADEMENT TO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG HE WAS STILL PROUD OF HIS ABILITY
233-134440-0009 WASH WILLIAMS DID NOT ASSOCIATE WITH THE MEN OF THE TOWN IN WHICH HE LIVED I'LL HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH THEM HE SAID LOOKING WITH BLEARY EYES AT THE MEN WHO WALKED ALONG THE STATION PLATFORM
233-134440-0010 PAST THE TELEGRAPH OFFICE UP ALONG MAIN STREET HE WENT IN THE EVENING TO ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON AND AFTER DRINKING UNBELIEVABLE QUANTITIES OF BEER STAGGERED OFF TO HIS ROOM IN THE NEW WILLARD HOUSE AND TO HIS BED FOR THE NIGHT
233-134440-0011 WASH WILLIAMS WAS A MAN OF COURAGE A THING HAD HAPPENED TO HIM THAT MADE HIM HATE LIFE AND HE HATED IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY WITH THE ABANDON OF A POET FIRST OF ALL HE HATED WOMEN
233-134440-0012 BITCHES HE CALLED THEM HIS FEELING TOWARD MEN WAS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT HE PITIED THEM DOES NOT EVERY MAN LET HIS LIFE BE MANAGED FOR HIM BY SOME BITCH OR ANOTHER HE ASKED
233-134440-0013 IN WINESBURG NO ATTENTION WAS PAID TO WASH WILLIAMS AND HIS HATRED OF HIS FELLOWS ONCE MISSUS WHITE THE BANKER'S WIFE COMPLAINED TO THE TELEGRAPH COMPANY
233-134440-0014 AND SMELLED ABOMINABLY BUT NOTHING CAME OF HER COMPLAINT HERE AND THERE A MAN RESPECTED THE OPERATOR INSTINCTIVELY THE MAN FELT IN HIM A GLOWING RESENTMENT OF SOMETHING HE HAD NOT THE COURAGE TO RESENT
233-134440-0015 WHEN WASH WALKED THROUGH THE STREETS SUCH A ONE HAD AN INSTINCT TO PAY HIM HOMAGE TO RAISE HIS HAT OR TO BOW BEFORE HIM THE SUPERINTENDENT WHO HAD SUPERVISION OVER THE TELEGRAPH OPERATORS
233-134440-0016 ON THE RAILROAD THAT WENT THROUGH WINESBURG FELT THAT WAY HE HAD PUT WASH INTO THE OBSCURE OFFICE AT WINESBURG TO AVOID DISCHARGING HIM AND HE MEANT TO KEEP HIM THERE WHEN HE RECEIVED THE LETTER OF COMPLAINT FROM THE BANKER'S WIFE
233-134440-0017 HE TORE IT UP AND LAUGHED UNPLEASANTLY FOR SOME REASON HE THOUGHT OF HIS OWN WIFE AS HE TORE UP THE LETTER WASH WILLIAMS ONCE HAD A WIFE WHEN HE WAS STILL A YOUNG MAN HE MARRIED A WOMAN AT DAYTON OHIO
233-134440-0018 THE WOMAN WAS TALL AND SLENDER AND HAD BLUE EYES AND YELLOW HAIR WASH WAS HIMSELF A COMELY YOUTH HE LOVED THE WOMAN WITH A LOVE AS ABSORBING AS THE HATRED HE LATER FELT FOR ALL WOMEN
233-134440-0019 IN ALL OF WINESBURG THERE WAS BUT ONE PERSON WHO KNEW THE STORY OF THE THING THAT HAD MADE UGLY THE PERSON AND THE CHARACTER OF WASH WILLIAMS
233-134440-0020 HE ONCE TOLD THE STORY TO GEORGE WILLARD AND THE TELLING OF THE TALE CAME ABOUT IN THIS WAY GEORGE WILLARD WENT ONE EVENING TO WALK WITH BELLE CARPENTER A TRIMMER OF WOMEN'S HATS

233-134440-0022 IN ED GRIFFITH'S SALOON BUT AS THEY WALKED ABOUT UNDER THE TREES THEY OCCASIONALLY EMBRACED THE NIGHT AND THEIR OWN THOUGHTS HAD AROUSED SOMETHING IN THEM AS THEY WERE RETURNING TO MAIN STREET THEY PASSED THE LITTLE LAWN
233-134440-0023 BESIDE THE RAILROAD STATION AND SAW WASH WILLIAMS APPARENTLY ASLEEP ON THE GRASS BENEATH A TREE ON THE NEXT EVENING THE OPERATOR AND GEORGE WILLARD WALKED OUT TOGETHER DOWN THE RAILROAD THEY WENT

233-134440-0035 HALF FRIGHTENED AND YET FASCINATED BY THE LIGHT BURNING IN THE EYES OF THE HIDEOUS OLD MAN GEORGE WILLARD LISTENED AFIRE WITH CURIOSITY DARKNESS CAME ON AND HE LEANED FORWARD

233-134440-0045 IN THE GARDEN BACK OF OUR HOUSE WE PLANTED VEGETABLES HE SAID YOU KNOW PEAS AND CORN AND SUCH THINGS WE WENT TO COLUMBUS IN EARLY MARCH AND AS SOON AS THE DAYS BECAME WARM I WENT TO WORK IN THE GARDEN

233-155990-0004 TO THEIR COUNTRY AND TO MANKIND THAN THOSE WHO EXALT UNRIGHTEOUS PEACE AS BETTER THAN RIGHTEOUS WAR THE MEN WHO HAVE STOOD HIGHEST IN OUR HISTORY AS IN THE HISTORY OF ALL COUNTRIES ARE THOSE WHO SCORNED INJUSTICE
233-155990-0005 WHO WERE INCAPABLE OF OPPRESSING THE WEAK OR OF PERMITTING THEIR COUNTRY WITH THEIR CONSENT TO OPPRESS THE WEAK BUT WHO DID NOT HESITATE TO DRAW THE SWORD WHEN TO LEAVE IT UNDRAWN MEANT INABILITY TO ARREST TRIUMPHANT WRONG
233-155990-0006 YET EVERY MAN IN ACTIVE AFFAIRS WHO ALSO READS ABOUT THE PAST GROWS BY BITTER EXPERIENCE TO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEN NOT ONLY AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN ILL BUT AMONG THOSE WHO MEAN WELL
233-155990-0007 WHO ARE READY ENOUGH TO PRAISE WHAT WAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YET ARE INCAPABLE OF PROFITING BY IT WHEN FACED BY THE NEEDS OF THE PRESENT DURING OUR GENERATION THIS SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN PECULIARLY THE CASE AMONG THE MEN
233-155990-0008 WHO HAVE BECOME OBSESSED WITH THE IDEA OF OBTAINING UNIVERSAL PEACE BY SOME CHEAP PATENT PANACEA THERE HAS BEEN A REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH
233-155990-0009 IN THE FEELING FOR INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND JUSTICE AMONG THE GREAT CIVILIZED NATIONS DURING THE PAST THREESCORE OR FOURSCORE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A REAL GROWTH OF RECOGNITION OF THE FACT
233-155990-0010 AND THAT IN MOST CASES WAR IS AN EVIL METHOD OF SETTLING INTERNATIONAL DIFFICULTIES BUT AS YET THERE HAS BEEN ONLY A RUDIMENTARY BEGINNING OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNATIONAL TRIBUNALS OF JUSTICE
233-155990-0011 AND THERE HAS BEEN NO DEVELOPMENT AT ALL OF ANY INTERNATIONAL POLICE POWER NOW AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THE WHOLE FABRIC OF MUNICIPAL LAW OF LAW WITHIN EACH NATION
233-155990-0012 RESTS ULTIMATELY UPON THE JUDGE AND THE POLICEMAN AND THE COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE POLICEMAN AND THE ALMOST COMPLETE ABSENCE OF THE JUDGE IN INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS PREVENTS THERE BEING AS YET ANY REAL HOMOLOGY
233-155990-0013 BETWEEN MUNICIPAL AND INTERNATIONAL LAW MOREOVER THE QUESTIONS WHICH SOMETIMES INVOLVE NATIONS IN WAR ARE FAR MORE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX THAN ANY QUESTIONS THAT AFFECT MERELY INDIVIDUALS
233-155990-0014 ALMOST EVERY GREAT NATION HAS INHERITED CERTAIN QUESTIONS EITHER WITH OTHER NATIONS OR WITH SECTIONS OF ITS OWN PEOPLE WHICH IT IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE IN THE PRESENT STATE OF CIVILIZATION TO DECIDE
233-155990-0015 AS MATTERS BETWEEN PRIVATE INDIVIDUALS CAN BE DECIDED DURING THE LAST CENTURY AT LEAST HALF OF THE WARS THAT HAVE BEEN FOUGHT HAVE BEEN CIVIL AND NOT FOREIGN WARS THERE ARE BIG AND POWERFUL NATIONS WHICH HABITUALLY COMMIT EITHER UPON OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0016 OR UPON SECTIONS OF THEIR OWN PEOPLE WRONGS SO OUTRAGEOUS AS TO JUSTIFY EVEN THE MOST PEACEFUL PERSONS IN GOING TO WAR THERE ARE ALSO WEAK NATIONS SO UTTERLY INCOMPETENT
233-155990-0017 EITHER TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF FOREIGNERS AGAINST THEIR OWN CITIZENS OR TO PROTECT THEIR OWN CITIZENS AGAINST FOREIGNERS THAT IT BECOMES A MATTER OF SHEER DUTY FOR SOME OUTSIDE POWER TO INTERFERE IN CONNECTION WITH THEM
233-155990-0018 AS YET IN NEITHER CASE IS THERE ANY EFFICIENT METHOD OF GETTING INTERNATIONAL ACTION AND IF JOINT ACTION BY SEVERAL POWERS IS SECURED THE RESULT IS USUALLY CONSIDERABLY WORSE THAN IF ONLY ONE POWER INTERFERED
233-155990-0019 THE WORST INFAMIES OF MODERN TIMES SUCH AFFAIRS AS THE MASSACRES OF THE ARMENIANS BY THE TURKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE BEEN PERPETRATED IN A TIME OF NOMINALLY PROFOUND INTERNATIONAL PEACE
233-155990-0020 WHEN THERE HAS BEEN A CONCERT OF BIG POWERS TO PREVENT THE BREAKING OF THIS PEACE ALTHOUGH ONLY BY BREAKING IT COULD THE OUTRAGES BE STOPPED BE IT REMEMBERED THAT THE PEOPLES WHO SUFFERED BY THESE HIDEOUS MASSACRES WHO SAW THEIR WOMEN VIOLATED
233-155990-0021 OTHERWISE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASSACRED FOR IF THE JEWS IN RUSSIA AND THE ARMENIANS IN TURKEY HAD BEEN ARMED AND HAD BEEN EFFICIENT IN THE USE OF THEIR ARMS NO MOB WOULD HAVE MEDDLED WITH THEM
233-155990-0022 YET AMIABLE BUT FATUOUS PERSONS WITH ALL THESE FACTS BEFORE THEIR EYES PASS RESOLUTIONS DEMANDING UNIVERSAL ARBITRATION FOR EVERYTHING
233-155990-0023 AND THEIR ABANDONMENT OF THEIR ARMED FORCES OR ELSE THEY WRITE WELL MEANING SOLEMN LITTLE BOOKS OR PAMPHLETS OR EDITORIALS AND ARTICLES IN MAGAZINES OR NEWSPAPERS TO SHOW
233-155990-0024 BECAUSE IT IS EXPENSIVE THIS IS PRECISELY LIKE ARGUING THAT WE SHOULD DISBAND THE POLICE AND DEVOTE OUR SOLE ATTENTION TO PERSUADING CRIMINALS
233-155990-0025 SUPPOSE THAT BURGLARY HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND WHITE SLAVERY ARE PROFITABLE IT IS ALMOST USELESS TO ATTEMPT TO ARGUE WITH THESE WELL INTENTIONED PERSONS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUFFERING UNDER AN OBSESSION AND ARE NOT OPEN TO REASON
233-155990-0026 THEY GO WRONG AT THE OUTSET FOR THEY LAY ALL THE EMPHASIS ON PEACE AND NONE AT ALL ON RIGHTEOUSNESS THEY ARE NOT ALL OF THEM PHYSICALLY TIMID MEN BUT THEY ARE USUALLY MEN
233-155990-0027 FROM INSULTING OR WRONGING THE PEOPLE OF OTHER NATIONS BUT THEY ALWAYS ARDENTLY ADVOCATE THAT WE IN OUR TURN SHALL TAMELY SUBMIT TO WRONG AND INSULT FROM OTHER NATIONS
233-155990-0028 AS AMERICANS THEIR FOLLY IS PECULIARLY SCANDALOUS BECAUSE IF THE PRINCIPLES THEY NOW UPHOLD ARE RIGHT IT MEANS THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER THAT AMERICANS SHOULD NEVER HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND BETTER THAT
233-155990-0029 IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY ONE THEY SHOULD HAVE PEACEFULLY SUBMITTED TO SEEING THEIR COUNTRY SPLIT INTO HALF A DOZEN JANGLING CONFEDERACIES AND SLAVERY MADE PERPETUAL IF UNWILLING TO LEARN FROM THEIR OWN HISTORY
233-155990-0030 LOOK AT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHINA AND JAPAN CHINA HAS NEITHER A FLEET NOR AN EFFICIENT ARMY IT IS A HUGE CIVILIZED EMPIRE ONE OF THE MOST POPULOUS ON THE GLOBE AND IT HAS BEEN THE HELPLESS PREY
233-155990-0031 OF OUTSIDERS BECAUSE IT DOES NOT POSSESS THE POWER TO FIGHT JAPAN STANDS ON A FOOTING OF EQUALITY WITH EUROPEAN AND AMERICAN NATIONS BECAUSE IT DOES POSSESS THIS POWER CHINA NOW SEES JAPAN
233-155990-0032 RUSSIA GERMANY ENGLAND AND FRANCE IN POSSESSION OF FRAGMENTS OF HER EMPIRE AND HAS TWICE WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE PRESENT GENERATION SEEN HER CAPITAL IN THE HANDS OF ALLIED INVADERS BECAUSE SHE IN VERY FACT
233-155990-0033 REALIZES THE IDEALS OF THE PERSONS WHO WISH THE UNITED STATES TO DISARM AND THEN TRUST THAT OUR HELPLESSNESS WILL SECURE US A CONTEMPTUOUS IMMUNITY FROM ATTACK BY OUTSIDE NATIONS
233-155990-0034 THE CHIEF TROUBLE COMES FROM THE ENTIRE INABILITY OF THESE WORTHY PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE DEMANDING THINGS THAT ARE MUTUALLY INCOMPATIBLE WHEN THEY DEMAND PEACE AT ANY PRICE AND ALSO JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS
233-155990-0035 I REMEMBER ONE REPRESENTATIVE OF THEIR NUMBER WHO USED TO WRITE LITTLE SONNETS ON BEHALF OF THE MAHDI AND THE SUDANESE THESE SONNETS SETTING FORTH THE NEED THAT THE SUDAN SHOULD BE BOTH INDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL
233-155990-0036 AS A MATTER OF FACT THE SUDAN VALUED INDEPENDENCE ONLY BECAUSE IT DESIRED TO WAR AGAINST ALL CHRISTIANS AND TO CARRY ON AN UNLIMITED SLAVE TRADE
233-155990-0037 UNDER THE MAHDI FOR A DOZEN YEARS AND DURING THOSE DOZEN YEARS THE BIGOTRY TYRANNY AND CRUEL RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE WERE SUCH AS FLOURISHED IN THE SEVENTH CENTURY AND IN SPITE OF SYSTEMATIC SLAVE RAIDS
233-155990-0038 THE POPULATION DECREASED BY NEARLY TWO THIRDS AND PRACTICALLY ALL THE CHILDREN DIED PEACE CAME WELL BEING CAME FREEDOM FROM RAPE AND MURDER AND TORTURE AND HIGHWAY ROBBERY AND EVERY BRUTAL GRATIFICATION OF LUST AND GREED CAME
233-155990-0039 ONLY WHEN THE SUDAN LOST ITS INDEPENDENCE AND PASSED UNDER ENGLISH RULE YET THIS WELL MEANING LITTLE SONNETEER SINCERELY FELT THAT HIS VERSES WERE ISSUED IN THE CAUSE OF HUMANITY
233-155990-0040 LOOKING BACK FROM THE VANTAGE POINT OF A SCORE OF YEARS PROBABLY EVERY ONE WILL AGREE THAT HE WAS AN ABSURD PERSON BUT HE WAS NOT ONE WHIT MORE ABSURD THAN MOST OF THE MORE PROMINENT PERSONS WHO ADVOCATE DISARMAMENT BY THE UNITED STATES
233-155990-0041 THE CESSATION OF UP BUILDING THE NAVY AND THE PROMISE TO AGREE TO ARBITRATE ALL MATTERS INCLUDING THOSE AFFECTING OUR NATIONAL INTERESTS AND HONOR WITH ALL FOREIGN NATIONS THESE PERSONS WOULD DO NO HARM
233-155990-0042 IF THEY AFFECTED ONLY THEMSELVES MANY OF THEM ARE IN THE ORDINARY RELATIONS OF LIFE GOOD CITIZENS THEY ARE EXACTLY LIKE THE OTHER GOOD CITIZENS WHO BELIEVE THAT ENFORCED UNIVERSAL VEGETARIANISM OR ANTI VACCINATION
233-155990-0043 IS THE PANACEA FOR ALL ILLS BUT IN THEIR PARTICULAR CASE THEY ARE ABLE TO DO HARM BECAUSE THEY AFFECT OUR RELATIONS WITH FOREIGN POWERS SO THAT OTHER MEN PAY THE DEBT WHICH THEY THEMSELVES HAVE REALLY INCURRED
233-155990-0044 IT IS THE FOOLISH PEACE AT ANY PRICE PERSONS WHO TRY TO PERSUADE OUR PEOPLE TO MAKE UNWISE AND IMPROPER TREATIES OR TO STOP BUILDING UP THE NAVY BUT IF TROUBLE COMES AND THE TREATIES ARE REPUDIATED
233-155990-0045 IT IS NOT THESE PEOPLE WHO WILL PAY ANYTHING THEY WILL STAY AT HOME IN SAFETY AND LEAVE BRAVE MEN TO PAY IN BLOOD AND HONEST MEN TO PAY IN SHAME FOR THEIR FOLLY THE TROUBLE IS THAT OUR POLICY IS APT TO GO IN ZIGZAGS
233-155990-0046 BECAUSE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF OUR PEOPLE EXERCISE AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNEQUAL PRESSURE ON OUR GOVERNMENT ONE CLASS OF OUR CITIZENS CLAMORS FOR TREATIES IMPOSSIBLE OF FULFILMENT AND IMPROPER TO FULFIL
2384-152900-0000 SO FAR I HAVE BEEN DEALING WITH OUR GENERAL OUTFIT AND SHALL NOW PASS TO THE SPECIAL EQUIPMENT OF THE SHORE PARTY THE HUT WE TOOK OUT WAS BUILT ON MY PROPERTY ON BUNDEFJORD SO THAT I WAS ABLE TO WATCH THE WORK AS IT PROGRESSED
2384-152900-0001 IT WAS BUILT BY THE BROTHERS HANS AND JOERGEN STUBBERUD AND WAS THROUGHOUT A SPLENDID PIECE OF WORK WHICH DID HONOUR TO BOTH THE BROTHERS THE MATERIALS PROVED EXCELLENT IN EVERY WAY THE HUT WAS TWENTY SIX FEET LONG BY THIRTEEN FEET WIDE
2384-152900-0002 ITS HEIGHT FROM THE FLOOR TO THE RIDGE OF THE ROOF WAS ABOUT TWELVE FEET IT WAS BUILT AS AN ORDINARY NORWEGIAN HOUSE WITH POINTED GABLE AND HAD TWO ROOMS ONE OF THESE WAS NINETEEN AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO SERVE AS OUR DORMITORY DINING ROOM AND SITTING ROOM
2384-152900-0003 THE OTHER ROOM WAS SIX AND A HALF FEET LONG AND WAS TO BE LINDSTROEM'S KITCHEN FROM THE KITCHEN A DOUBLE TRAP DOOR LED TO THE LOFT WHERE WE INTENDED TO KEEP A QUANTITY OF PROVISIONS AND OUTFIT THE WALLS CONSISTED OF THREE INCH PLANKS
2384-152900-0004 FOR INSULATION WE USED CELLULOSE PULP THE FLOOR AND THE CEILING BETWEEN THE ROOMS AND THE LOFT WERE DOUBLE
2384-152900-0005 THE DOORS WERE EXTRAORDINARILY THICK AND STRONG AND FITTED INTO OBLIQUE GROOVES SO THAT THEY CLOSED VERY TIGHTLY THERE WERE TWO WINDOWS A TRIPLE ONE IN THE END WALL OF THE MAIN ROOM AND A DOUBLE ONE IN THE KITCHEN
2384-152900-0006 FOR THE COVERING OF THE ROOF WE TOOK OUT ROOFING PAPER AND FOR THE FLOOR LINOLEUM IN THE MAIN ROOM THERE WERE TWO AIR PIPES
2384-152900-0007 THERE WERE BUNKS FOR TEN MEN IN TWO STAGES SIX ON ONE WALL AND FOUR ON THE OTHER THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOM CONSISTED OF A TABLE A STOOL FOR EACH MAN AND A LUX LAMP
2384-152900-0008 THE HUT WAS TARRED SEVERAL TIMES AND EVERY PART WAS CAREFULLY MARKED SO THAT IT COULD EASILY BE SET UP TO FASTEN IT TO THE GROUND AND PREVENT THE ANTARCTIC STORMS FROM BLOWING IT AWAY I HAD STRONG EYEBOLTS SCREWED INTO EACH END OF THE ROOF RIDGE
2384-152900-0009 AND THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE ROOF WE CARRIED SIX STRONG EYEBOLTS A METRE LONG TO BE RAMMED INTO THE BARRIER BETWEEN THESE BOLTS AND THOSE ON THE HUT STEEL WIRES WERE TO BE STRETCHED WHICH COULD BE DRAWN QUITE TIGHT WE ALSO HAD TWO SPARE CABLES
2384-152900-0010 WHICH COULD BE STRETCHED OVER THE ROOF IF THE GALES WERE TOO SEVERE THE TWO VENTILATING PIPES AND THE CHIMNEY WERE SECURED OUTSIDE WITH STRONG STAYS AS WILL BE SEEN EVERY PRECAUTION WAS TAKEN TO MAKE THE HUT WARM AND COMFORTABLE
2384-152900-0011 AND TO HOLD IT DOWN ON THE GROUND WE ALSO TOOK ON BOARD A QUANTITY OF LOOSE TIMBER BOARDS AND PLANKS BESIDES THE HUT WE TOOK WITH US FIFTEEN TENTS FOR SIXTEEN MEN EACH TEN OF THESE WERE OLD BUT GOOD
2384-152900-0012 THEY WERE SERVED OUT TO US FROM THE NAVAL STORES THE OTHER FIVE WERE NEW AND WE BOUGHT THEM FROM THE ARMY DEPOTS IT WAS OUR INTENTION TO USE THE TENTS AS TEMPORARY HOUSES THEY WERE EASILY AND QUICKLY SET UP AND WERE STRONG AND WARM
2384-152900-0013 ON THE VOYAGE TO THE SOUTH ROENNE SEWED NEW FLOORS OF GOOD STRONG CANVAS TO THE FIVE NEW TENTS ALL CASES OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE INTENDED FOR WINTER QUARTERS WERE MARKED AND STOWED SEPARATELY IN THE HOLD
2384-152900-0014 WE HAD TEN SLEDGES MADE BY A FIRM OF SPORTING OUTFITTERS IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE BUILT LIKE THE OLD NANSEN SLEDGES BUT RATHER BROADER AND WERE TWELVE FEET LONG THE RUNNERS WERE OF THE BEST AMERICAN HICKORY SHOD WITH STEEL
2384-152900-0015 THE OTHER PARTS WERE OF GOOD TOUGH NORWEGIAN ASH TO EACH SLEDGE BELONGED A PAIR OF SPARE RUNNERS WHICH COULD EASILY BE FITTED UNDERNEATH BY MEANS OF CLAMPS AND AS EASILY REMOVED WHEN NOT REQUIRED
2384-152900-0016 THE STEEL SHOEING OF THE RUNNERS WAS WELL COATED WITH RED LEAD AND THE SPARE RUNNERS WITH TAR THESE SLEDGES WERE EXTREMELY STRONGLY BUILT AND COULD STAND ALL KINDS OF WORK ON EVERY SORT OF SURFACE AT THAT TIME
2384-152900-0017 I DID NOT KNOW THE CONDITIONS ON THE BARRIER AS I AFTERWARDS CAME TO KNOW THEM OF COURSE THESE SLEDGES WERE VERY HEAVY WE TOOK TWENTY PAIRS OF SKI ALL OF THE FINEST HICKORY THEY WERE EIGHT FEET LONG AND PROPORTIONATELY NARROW
2384-152900-0018 I CHOSE THEM OF THIS LENGTH WITH A VIEW TO BEING ABLE TO CROSS THE NUMEROUS CRACKS IN THE GLACIERS THE GREATER THE SURFACE OVER WHICH THE WEIGHT COULD BE DISTRIBUTED THE BETTER PROSPECT WE SHOULD HAVE OF SLIPPING OVER THE SNOW BRIDGES
2384-152900-0019 WE HAD FORTY SKI POLES WITH EBONITE POINTS THE SKI BINDINGS WERE A COMBINATION OF THE HUITFELDT AND THE HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS WE ALSO HAD QUANTITIES OF LOOSE STRAPS
2384-152900-0020 WE HAD SIX THREE MAN TENTS ALL MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS THE WORKMANSHIP COULD NOT HAVE BEEN BETTER THEY WERE THE STRONGEST AND MOST PRACTICAL TENTS THAT HAVE EVER BEEN USED THEY WERE MADE OF THE CLOSEST CANVAS WITH THE FLOOR IN ONE PIECE
2384-152900-0021 ONE MAN WAS SUFFICIENT TO SET UP THE TENT IN THE STIFFEST BREEZE I HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT THE FEWER POLES A TENT HAS THE EASIER IT IS TO SET UP WHICH SEEMS QUITE NATURAL THESE TENTS HAVE ONLY ONE POLE
2384-152900-0022 HOW OFTEN ONE READS IN NARRATIVES OF POLAR TRAVEL THAT IT TOOK SUCH AND SUCH A TIME OFTEN HOURS TO SET UP THE TENT AND THEN WHEN AT LAST IT WAS UP ONE LAY EXPECTING IT TO BE BLOWN DOWN AT ANY MOMENT
2384-152900-0023 THERE WAS NO QUESTION OF THIS WITH OUR TENTS THEY WERE UP IN A TWINKLING AND STOOD AGAINST ALL KINDS OF WIND WE COULD LIE SECURELY IN OUR SLEEPING BAGS AND LET IT BLOW THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE DOOR WAS ON THE USUAL SACK PRINCIPLE
2384-152900-0024 WHICH CAME FROM THE ESTATE OF PALSGAARD IN JUTLAND AND THE MATERIAL DID ALL IT PROMISED THESE CASES WERE ONE FOOT SQUARE AND FIFTEEN AND A HALF INCHES HIGH
2384-152900-0025 THEY HAD ONLY A LITTLE ROUND OPENING ON THE TOP CLOSED WITH AN ALUMINIUM LID WHICH FITTED EXACTLY LIKE THE LID OF A MILK CAN LARGE LIDS WEAKEN THE CASES AND I HAD THEREFORE CHOSEN THIS FORM WE DID NOT HAVE TO THROW OFF THE LASHING OF THE CASE TO GET THE LID OFF
2384-152900-0026 AND THIS IS A VERY GREAT ADVANTAGE WE COULD ALWAYS GET AT IT A CASE WITH A LARGE LID COVERED BY THE LASHING GIVES CONSTANT TROUBLE THE WHOLE LASHING HAS TO BE UNDONE FOR EVERY LITTLE THING ONE WANTS OUT OF THE CASE THIS IS NOT ALWAYS CONVENIENT
2384-152900-0027 IF ONE IS TIRED AND SLACK IT MAY SOMETIMES HAPPEN THAT ONE WILL PUT OFF TILL TO MORROW WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE TO DAY ESPECIALLY WHEN IT IS BITTERLY COLD
2384-152900-0028 THE HANDIER ONE'S SLEDGING OUTFIT THE SOONER ONE GETS INTO THE TENT AND TO REST AND THAT IS NO SMALL CONSIDERATION ON A LONG JOURNEY OUR OUTFIT OF CLOTHING WAS ABUNDANT AND MORE COMPLETE I SUPPOSE THAN THAT OF ANY FORMER POLAR EXPEDITION
2384-152900-0029 WE MAY DIVIDE IT INTO TWO CLASSES THE OUTFIT FOR SPECIALLY LOW TEMPERATURES AND THAT FOR MORE MODERATE TEMPERATURES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD YET WINTERED ON THE BARRIER SO WE HAD TO BE PREPARED FOR ANYTHING
2384-152900-0030 IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO GRAPPLE WITH ANY DEGREE OF COLD WE WERE SUPPLIED WITH THE RICHEST ASSORTMENT OF REINDEER SKIN CLOTHING WE HAD IT SPECIALLY THICK MEDIUM AND QUITE LIGHT IT TOOK A LONG TIME TO GET THESE SKIN CLOTHES PREPARED
2384-152900-0031 FIRST THE REINDEER SKINS HAD TO BE BOUGHT IN A RAW STATE
2384-152900-0032 LET ME TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF THANKING THIS MAN FOR THE MANY AND GREAT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED ME NOT ONLY DURING MY PREPARATIONS FOR THE THIRD VOYAGE OF THE FRAM
2384-152900-0033 WITH HIS HELP I HAVE SUCCEEDED IN OBTAINING THINGS THAT I SHOULD OTHERWISE NEVER HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET HE SHRANK FROM NO AMOUNT OF WORK BUT WENT ON TILL HE HAD FOUND WHAT I WANTED
2384-152900-0034 THIS TIME HE PROCURED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY GOOD REINDEER SKINS DRESSED BY THE LAPPS AND SENT THEM TO CHRISTIANIA HERE I HAD GREAT TROUBLE IN FINDING A MAN WHO COULD SEW SKINS BUT AT LAST I FOUND ONE
2384-152900-0035 WE THEN WENT TO WORK TO MAKE CLOTHES AFTER THE PATTERN OF THE NETCHELLI ESKIMO AND THE SEWING WENT ON EARLY AND LATE THICK ANORAKS AND THIN ONES HEAVY BREECHES AND LIGHT WINTER STOCKINGS AND SUMMER STOCKINGS
2384-152900-0036 WE ALSO HAD A DOZEN THIN SLEEPING BAGS WHICH I THOUGHT OF USING INSIDE THE BIG THICK ONES IF THE COLD SHOULD BE TOO SEVERE EVERYTHING WAS FINISHED BUT NOT UNTIL THE LAST MOMENT THE OUTER SLEEPING BAGS WERE MADE BY MISTER BRANDT FURRIER OF BERGEN
2384-152900-0037 AND THEY WERE SO EXCELLENT BOTH IN MATERIAL AND MAKING UP THAT NO ONE IN THE WORLD COULD HAVE DONE BETTER IT WAS A MODEL PIECE OF WORK TO SAVE THIS OUTER SLEEPING BAG WE HAD IT PROVIDED WITH A COVER OF THE LIGHTEST CANVAS
2384-152900-0038 WHICH WAS A GOOD DEAL LONGER THAN THE BAG ITSELF IT WAS EASY TO TIE THE END OF THE COVER TOGETHER LIKE THE MOUTH OF THE SACK AND THIS KEPT THE SNOW OUT OF THE BAG DURING THE DAY'S MARCH
2384-152900-0039 IN THIS WAY WE ALWAYS KEPT OURSELVES FREE FROM THE ANNOYANCE OF DRIFTING SNOW WE ATTACHED GREAT IMPORTANCE TO HAVING THE BAGS MADE OF THE VERY BEST SORT OF SKIN AND TOOK CARE THAT THE THIN SKIN OF THE BELLY WAS REMOVED
2384-152900-0040 AS OF COURSE THE COLD PENETRATES MORE EASILY THROUGH THE THIN SKIN AND GIVES RISE TO DAMPNESS IN THE FORM OF RIME ON MEETING THE WARMTH OF THE BODY THESE THIN PATCHES REMAIN DAMP WHENEVER ONE IS IN THE BAG AND IN A SHORT TIME THEY LOSE THEIR HAIR
2384-152900-0041 THE DAMP SPREADS LIKE DECAY IN WOOD AND CONTINUALLY ATTACKS THE SURROUNDING SKIN WITH THE RESULT THAT ONE FINE DAY YOU FIND YOURSELF WITH A HAIRLESS SLEEPING BAG
2384-152900-0042 OUR BURBERRY WIND CLOTHES WERE MADE IN THE FORM OF ANORAK BLOUSE AND TROUSERS BOTH VERY ROOMY THE OTHERS CONSISTED OF TROUSERS AND JACKET WITH HOOD OUR MITS WERE FOR THE MOST PART SUCH AS ONE CAN BUY IN ANY SHOP
2384-152900-0043 WE WANTED NOTHING ELSE IN AND AROUND WINTER QUARTERS OUTSIDE THE MITS WE WORE AN OUTER COVERING OF WINDPROOF MATERIAL SO AS NOT TO WEAR THEM OUT TOO QUICKLY THESE MITS ARE NOT VERY STRONG THOUGH THEY ARE GOOD AND WARM
2384-152900-0044 BESIDES THESE WE HAD TEN PAIRS OF ORDINARY KID MITS WHICH WERE BOUGHT AT A GLOVE SHOP IN CHRISTIANIA AND WERE PRACTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO WEAR OUT I WORE MINE FROM FRAMHEIM TO THE POLE AND BACK AGAIN AND AFTERWARDS ON THE VOYAGE TO TASMANIA
2384-152900-0045 THE LINING OF COURSE WAS TORN IN PLACES BUT THE SEAMS OF THE MITS WERE JUST AS PERFECT AS THE DAY I BOUGHT THEM TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT I WENT ON SKI THE WHOLE WAY AND USED TWO POLES IT WILL BE UNDERSTOOD THAT THE MITS WERE STRONGLY MADE
2384-152900-0046 WE ALSO HAD A NUMBER OF WOOLLEN GLOVES WHICH CURIOUSLY ENOUGH THE OTHERS GREATLY PRIZED FOR MYSELF I WAS NEVER ABLE TO WEAR SUCH THINGS THEY SIMPLY FREEZE THE FINGERS OFF ME BUT MOST IMPORTANT OF ALL IS THE COVERING OF THE FEET
2384-152900-0047 FOR THE FEET ARE THE MOST EXPOSED MEMBERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROTECT ONE CAN LOOK AFTER THE HANDS
2384-152900-0048 AND THIS IS A SUFFICIENTLY TROUBLESOME PIECE OF WORK TO MAKE ONE DISINCLINED TO UNDO IT AGAIN UNTIL ONE IS TURNING IN THEY CANNOT BE SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND ONE HAS TO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON FEELING BUT FEELING IN THIS CASE OFTEN PLAYS CURIOUS TRICKS
2384-152900-0049 FOR IF THEY HAD KNOWN IT THEY COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE LET IT GO SO FAR THE FACT IS THAT IN THIS CASE SENSATION IS A SOMEWHAT DOUBTFUL GUIDE FOR THE FEET LOSE ALL SENSATION
2384-152900-0050 IT IS TRUE THAT THERE IS A TRANSITIONAL STAGE WHEN ONE FEELS THE COLD SMARTING IN ONE'S TOES AND TRIES TO GET RID OF IT BY STAMPING THE FEET AS A RULE THIS IS SUCCESSFUL THE WARMTH RETURNS OR THE CIRCULATION IS RESTORED
2384-152900-0051 BUT IT OCCASIONALLY HAPPENS THAT SENSATION IS LOST AT THE VERY MOMENT WHEN THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE TAKEN AND THEN ONE MUST BE AN OLD HAND TO KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED MANY MEN CONCLUDE THAT AS THEY NO LONGER FEEL THE UNPLEASANT SMARTING SENSATION ALL IS WELL
2384-152900-0052 AND AT THE EVENING INSPECTION A FROZEN FOOT OF TALLOW LIKE APPEARANCE PRESENTS ITSELF AN EVENT OF THIS KIND MAY RUIN THE MOST ELABORATELY PREPARED ENTERPRISE AND IT IS THEREFORE ADVISABLE IN THE MATTER OF FEET
2384-152900-0053 TO CARRY ONE'S CAUTION TO LENGTHS WHICH MAY SEEM RIDICULOUS NOW IT IS A FACT THAT IF ONE CAN WEAR SOFT FOOT GEAR EXCLUSIVELY THE RISK OF FROST BITE IS FAR LESS THAN IF ONE IS COMPELLED TO WEAR STIFF BOOTS IN SOFT FOOT GEAR OF COURSE
2384-152900-0054 THE FOOT CAN MOVE FAR MORE EASILY AND KEEP WARM BUT WE WERE TO TAKE SKI AND TO GET FULL USE OUT OF THEM SO THAT IN ANY CASE WE HAD TO HAVE A STIFF SOLE FOR THE SAKE OF THE BINDINGS IT IS OF NO USE TO HAVE A GOOD BINDING UNLESS YOU CAN USE IT IN THE RIGHT WAY
2384-152900-0055 IN MY OPINION ON A LONG JOURNEY SUCH AS THAT WE HAD BEFORE US THE SKI MUST BE PERFECTLY STEADY I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING THAT TIRES ME MORE THAN A BAD FASTENING THAT IS ONE THAT ALLOWS THE FOOT TO SHIFT IN THE BINDING
2384-152900-0056 I WANT THE SKI TO BE A PART OF ONESELF SO THAT ONE ALWAYS HAS FULL COMMAND OF THEM I HAVE TRIED MANY PATENTS FOR I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID OF A STIFF FASTENING IN COLD TEMPERATURES BUT ALL THESE PATENTS WITHOUT EXCEPTION ARE WORTHLESS IN THE LONG RUN
2384-152900-0057 I DECIDED THIS TIME TO TRY A COMBINATION OF STIFF AND SOFT FOOT GEAR SO THAT WE COULD USE THE SPLENDID HUITFELDT HOEYER ELLEFSEN BINDINGS BUT THIS WAS NO EASY MATTER OF OUR WHOLE OUTFIT NOTHING CAUSED ME MORE WORRY
2384-152900-0058 OR GAVE US ALL MORE WORK IN THE COURSE OF THE EXPEDITION THAN THE STIFF OUTER COVERING WHICH WE HAD TO HAVE BUT WE SOLVED THE PROBLEM AT LAST I APPLIED TO ONE OF THE LEADING MAKERS OF SKI BOOTS IN CHRISTIANIA AND EXPLAINED THE DIFFICULTY TO HIM
2384-152900-0059 FORTUNATELY I HAD FOUND A MAN WHO WAS EVIDENTLY INTERESTED IN THE QUESTION WE AGREED THAT HE SHOULD MAKE A SAMPLE PAIR AFTER THE PATTERN OF SKI BOOTS THE SOLE WAS TO BE THICK AND STIFF FOR WE HAD TO BE PREPARED TO USE CRAMPONS BUT THE UPPERS AS SOFT AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0060 IN ORDER TO AVOID LEATHER WHICH USUALLY BECOMES STIFF AND EASILY CRACKED IN THE COLD HE WAS TO USE A COMBINATION OF LEATHER AND THIN CANVAS FOR THE UPPERS LEATHER NEAREST THE SOLE AND CANVAS ABOVE IT THE MEASUREMENTS WERE TAKEN FROM MY FOOT
2384-152900-0061 WHICH IS NOT EXACTLY A CHILD'S FOOT WITH TWO PAIRS OF REINDEER SKIN STOCKINGS ON AND TEN PAIRS WERE MADE
2384-152900-0062 THEY WERE EXHIBITED IN THE BOOTMAKER'S WINDOWS I USED TO GO A LONG WAY ROUND TO AVOID COMING FACE TO FACE WITH THESE MONSTERS IN PUBLIC WE ARE ALL A TRIFLE VAIN AND DISLIKE HAVING OUR OWN SHORTCOMINGS SHOWN UP IN ELECTRIC LIGHT
2384-152900-0063 IF I HAD EVER CHERISHED ANY ILLUSIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF A DAINTY LITTLE FOOT I AM SURE THE LAST TRACE OF SUCH VANITY DIED OUT ON THE DAY I PASSED THE SHOEMAKER'S WINDOW AND BEHELD MY OWN BOOTS
2384-152900-0064 I NEVER WENT THAT WAY AGAIN UNTIL I WAS CERTAIN THAT THE EXHIBITION WAS CLOSED ONE THING IS CERTAIN THAT THE BOOTS WERE A FINE PIECE OF WORKMANSHIP WE SHALL HEAR LATER ON OF THE ALTERATIONS THEY HAD TO UNDERGO BEFORE WE AT LAST MADE THEM AS LARGE AS WE WANTED
2384-152900-0065 FOR THE GIANT BOOTS TURNED OUT MUCH TOO SMALL AMONG OTHER EQUIPMENT I MUST MENTION OUR EXCELLENT PRIMUS COOKING APPARATUS THIS ALL CAME COMPLETE FROM A FIRM IN STOCKHOLM FOR COOKING ON SLEDGE JOURNEYS THE PRIMUS STOVE RANKS ABOVE ALL OTHERS
2384-152900-0066 IT GIVES A GREAT DEAL OF HEAT USES LITTLE OIL AND REQUIRES NO ATTENTION ADVANTAGES WHICH ARE IMPORTANT ENOUGH ANYWHERE BUT ESPECIALLY WHEN SLEDGING THERE IS NEVER ANY TROUBLE WITH THIS APPARATUS IT HAS COME AS NEAR PERFECTION AS POSSIBLE
2384-152900-0067 WE TOOK FIVE NANSEN COOKERS WITH US THIS COOKER UTILIZES THE HEAT MORE COMPLETELY THAN ANY OTHER BUT I HAVE ONE OBJECTION TO MAKE TO IT IT TAKES UP SPACE WE USED IT ON OUR DEPOT JOURNEYS
2384-152900-0068 BUT WERE UNFORTUNATELY OBLIGED TO GIVE IT UP ON THE MAIN SOUTHERN JOURNEY WE WERE SO MANY IN A TENT AND SPACE WAS SO LIMITED THAT I DARED NOT RISK USING IT IF ONE HAS ROOM ENOUGH IT IS IDEAL IN MY OPINION
2384-152900-0069 WE HAD WITH US TEN PAIRS OF SNOW SHOES AND ONE HUNDRED SETS OF DOG HARNESS OF THE ALASKA ESKIMO PATTERN THE ALASKA ESKIMO DRIVE THEIR DOGS IN TANDEM THE WHOLE PULL IS THUS STRAIGHT AHEAD IN THE DIRECTION THE SLEDGE IS GOING
2384-152900-0070 AND THIS IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE BEST WAY OF UTILIZING THE POWER I HAD MADE UP MY MIND TO ADOPT THE SAME SYSTEM IN SLEDGING ON THE BARRIER ANOTHER GREAT ADVANTAGE IT HAD WAS THAT THE DOGS WOULD PASS SINGLY ACROSS FISSURES
2384-152900-0071 SO THAT THE DANGER OF FALLING THROUGH WAS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED THE EXERTION OF PULLING IS ALSO LESS TRYING WITH ALASKA HARNESS THAN WITH THE GREENLAND KIND AS THE ALASKA HARNESS HAS A SHALLOW PADDED COLLAR
2384-152900-0072 WHICH IS SLIPPED OVER THE ANIMAL'S HEAD AND MAKES THE WEIGHT OF THE PULL COME ON HIS SHOULDERS WHEREAS THE GREENLAND HARNESS PRESSES ON HIS CHEST RAW PLACES WHICH OCCUR RATHER FREQUENTLY WITH THE GREENLAND HARNESS ARE ALMOST ENTIRELY AVOIDED WITH THE OTHER
2384-152900-0073 ALL THE SETS OF HARNESS WERE MADE IN THE NAVY WORKSHOPS AND AFTER THEIR LONG AND HARD USE THEY ARE AS GOOD AS EVER THERE COULD BE NO BETTER RECOMMENDATION THAN THIS OF INSTRUMENTS AND APPARATUS FOR THE SLEDGE JOURNEYS WE CARRIED TWO SEXTANTS
2384-152900-0074 THREE ARTIFICIAL HORIZONS OF WHICH TWO WERE GLASS HORIZONS WITH DARK GLASSES AND ONE A MERCURY HORIZON AND FOUR SPIRIT COMPASSES MADE IN CHRISTIANIA THEY WERE EXCELLENT LITTLE COMPASSES
2384-152900-0075 I HAD DRAWN THE MAKER'S ATTENTION TO THIS BEFOREHAND AND ASKED HIM TO USE AS PURE A SPIRIT AS POSSIBLE WHAT HIS OBJECT WAS I STILL DO NOT KNOW BUT THE SPIRIT HE EMPLOYED WAS HIGHLY DILUTE
2384-152900-0076 THE BEST PROOF OF THIS WAS THAT THE LIQUID IN OUR COMPASSES FROZE BEFORE THE SPIRITS IN A FLASK WE WERE NATURALLY INCONVENIENCED BY THIS BESIDES THESE WE HAD AN ORDINARY LITTLE POCKET COMPASS TWO PAIRS OF BINOCULARS ONE BY ZEISS AND THE OTHER BY GOERTZ
2384-152900-0077 AND SNOW GOGGLES FROM DOCTOR SCHANZ
2384-152900-0078 DURING THE WHOLE STAY ON THE BARRIER I MYSELF WORE A PAIR OF ORDINARY SPECTACLES WITH YELLOW GLASSES OF QUITE A LIGHT TINT
2384-152900-0079 HOW EXCELLENT THESE GLASSES ARE APPEARS CLEARLY ENOUGH FROM THE FACT THAT I NEVER HAD THE SLIGHTEST TOUCH OF SNOW BLINDNESS ON THE SOUTHERN JOURNEY
2384-152900-0080 IT WILL PERHAPS BE SUGGESTED THAT I AM LESS SUSCEPTIBLE TO THIS AILMENT THAN OTHERS BUT I KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT SUCH IS NOT THE CASE I HAVE PREVIOUSLY HAD SEVERAL SEVERE ATTACKS OF SNOW BLINDNESS WE HAD TWO PHOTOGRAPHIC CAMERAS AN AIR THERMOMETER
2384-152900-0081 TWO ANEROIDS WITH ALTITUDE SCALE TO FIFTEEN THOUSAND FEET AND TWO HYPSOMETERS THE HYPSOMETER IS ONLY AN INSTRUMENT FOR DETERMINING THE BOILING POINT WHICH GIVES ONE THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA THE METHOD IS BOTH SIMPLE AND RELIABLE
2384-152900-0082 THE MEDICAL STORES FOR SLEDGING WERE GIVEN BY A LONDON FIRM AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE THINGS WERE PACKED SPEAKS FOR THE WHOLE OUTFIT THERE IS NOT A SPECK OF RUST ON NEEDLES SCISSORS KNIVES OR ANYTHING ELSE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO MUCH DAMP
2384-152900-0083 OUR OWN MEDICAL OUTFIT WHICH WAS BOUGHT IN CHRISTIANIA AND ACCORDING TO THE VENDOR'S STATEMENT UNUSUALLY WELL PACKED BECAME IN A SHORT TIME SO DAMAGED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT IS NOW ENTIRELY SPOILT THE SLEDGING PROVISIONS MUST BE MENTIONED BRIEFLY
2384-152900-0084 I HAVE ALREADY SPOKEN OF THE PEMMICAN I HAVE NEVER CONSIDERED IT NECESSARY TO TAKE A WHOLE GROCER'S SHOP WITH ME WHEN SLEDGING THE FOOD SHOULD BE SIMPLE AND NOURISHING AND THAT IS ENOUGH A RICH AND VARIED MENU IS FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE NO WORK TO DO
2384-152900-0085 BESIDES THE PEMMICAN WE HAD BISCUITS MILK POWDER AND CHOCOLATE THE BISCUITS WERE A PRESENT FROM A WELL KNOWN NORWEGIAN FACTORY AND DID ALL HONOUR TO THEIR ORIGIN THEY WERE SPECIALLY BAKED FOR US AND WERE MADE OF OATMEAL WITH THE ADDITION OF DRIED MILK AND A LITTLE SUGAR
2384-152900-0086 THEY WERE EXTREMELY NOURISHING AND PLEASANT TO THE TASTE THANKS TO EFFICIENT PACKING THEY KEPT FRESH AND CRISP ALL THE TIME THESE BISCUITS FORMED A GREAT PART OF OUR DAILY DIET AND UNDOUBTEDLY CONTRIBUTED IN NO SMALL DEGREE TO THE SUCCESSFUL RESULT
2384-152900-0087 MILK POWDER IS A COMPARATIVELY NEW COMMODITY WITH US BUT IT DESERVES TO BE BETTER KNOWN IT CAME FROM THE DISTRICT OF JAEDEREN NEITHER HEAT NOR COLD DRYNESS NOR WET COULD HURT IT
2384-152900-0088 WE HAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF IT LYING OUT IN SMALL THIN LINEN BAGS IN EVERY POSSIBLE STATE OF THE WEATHER THE POWDER WAS AS GOOD THE LAST DAY AS THE FIRST WE ALSO TOOK DRIED MILK FROM A FIRM IN WISCONSIN THIS MILK HAD AN ADDITION OF MALT AND SUGAR
2384-152900-0089 AND WAS IN MY OPINION EXCELLENT IT ALSO KEPT GOOD THE WHOLE TIME THE CHOCOLATE CAME FROM A WORLD RENOWNED FIRM AND WAS BEYOND ALL PRAISE THE WHOLE SUPPLY WAS A VERY ACCEPTABLE GIFT
2391-145015-0000 STEVENTON IS A SMALL RURAL VILLAGE UPON THE CHALK HILLS OF NORTH HANTS SITUATED IN A WINDING VALLEY ABOUT SEVEN MILES FROM BASINGSTOKE THE SOUTH WESTERN RAILWAY CROSSES IT BY A SHORT EMBANKMENT
2391-145015-0001 AND AS IT CURVES ROUND PRESENTS A GOOD VIEW OF IT ON THE LEFT HAND TO THOSE WHO ARE TRAVELLING DOWN THE LINE ABOUT THREE MILES BEFORE ENTERING THE TUNNEL UNDER POPHAM BEACON IT MAY BE KNOWN TO SOME SPORTSMEN AS LYING IN ONE OF THE BEST PORTIONS OF THE VINE HUNT
2391-145015-0002 IT IS CERTAINLY NOT A PICTURESQUE COUNTRY IT PRESENTS NO GRAND OR EXTENSIVE VIEWS BUT THE FEATURES ARE SMALL RATHER THAN PLAIN THE SURFACE CONTINUALLY SWELLS AND SINKS BUT THE HILLS ARE NOT BOLD NOR THE VALLEYS DEEP
2391-145015-0003 AND THOUGH IT IS SUFFICIENTLY WELL CLOTHED WITH WOODS AND HEDGEROWS YET THE POVERTY OF THE SOIL IN MOST PLACES PREVENTS THE TIMBER FROM ATTAINING A LARGE SIZE STILL IT HAS ITS BEAUTIES THE LANES WIND ALONG IN A NATURAL CURVE
2391-145015-0004 CONTINUALLY FRINGED WITH IRREGULAR BORDERS OF NATIVE TURF AND LEAD TO PLEASANT NOOKS AND CORNERS ONE WHO KNEW AND LOVED IT WELL VERY HAPPILY EXPRESSED ITS QUIET CHARMS WHEN HE WROTE TRUE TASTE IS NOT FASTIDIOUS
2391-145015-0005 NOR REJECTS BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT COME WITHIN THE RULE OF COMPOSITION PURE AND PICTURESQUE UNNUMBERED SIMPLE SCENES WHICH FILL THE LEAVES OF NATURE'S SKETCH BOOK OF THIS SOMEWHAT TAME COUNTRY STEVENTON FROM THE FALL OF THE GROUND AND THE ABUNDANCE OF ITS TIMBER
2391-145015-0006 IS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE PRETTIEST SPOTS
2391-145015-0007 COMPARED WITH THE BROAD RIVER THE RICH VALLEY AND THE NOBLE HILLS WHICH SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO BEHOLD AT HER NATIVE HOME NEAR HENLEY UPON THAMES THE HOUSE ITSELF STOOD IN A SHALLOW VALLEY SURROUNDED BY SLOPING MEADOWS WELL SPRINKLED WITH ELM TREES AT THE END OF A SMALL VILLAGE OF COTTAGES
2391-145015-0008 EACH WELL PROVIDED WITH A GARDEN SCATTERED ABOUT PRETTILY ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ROAD IT WAS SUFFICIENTLY COMMODIOUS TO HOLD PUPILS IN ADDITION TO A GROWING FAMILY AND WAS IN THOSE TIMES CONSIDERED TO BE ABOVE THE AVERAGE OF PARSONAGES
2391-145015-0009 NO CORNICE MARKED THE JUNCTION OF WALL AND CEILING WHILE THE BEAMS WHICH SUPPORTED THE UPPER FLOORS PROJECTED INTO THE ROOMS BELOW IN ALL THEIR NAKED SIMPLICITY COVERED ONLY BY A COAT OF PAINT OR WHITEWASH
2391-145015-0010 AND ABOUT FORTY FIVE YEARS AGO IT WAS PULLED DOWN FOR THE PURPOSE OF ERECTING A NEW HOUSE IN A FAR BETTER SITUATION ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE VALLEY
2391-145015-0011 ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE GROUND ROSE GENTLY AND WAS OCCUPIED BY ONE OF THOSE OLD FASHIONED GARDENS IN WHICH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS ARE COMBINED FLANKED AND PROTECTED ON THE EAST BY ONE OF THE THATCHED MUD WALLS COMMON IN THAT COUNTRY AND OVERSHADOWED BY FINE ELMS
2391-145015-0012 ALONG THE UPPER OR SOUTHERN SIDE OF THIS GARDEN RAN A TERRACE OF THE FINEST TURF
2391-145015-0013 BUT THE CHIEF BEAUTY OF STEVENTON CONSISTED IN ITS HEDGEROWS A HEDGEROW IN THAT COUNTRY DOES NOT MEAN A THIN FORMAL LINE OF QUICKSET BUT AN IRREGULAR BORDER OF COPSE WOOD AND TIMBER OFTEN WIDE ENOUGH TO CONTAIN WITHIN IT A WINDING FOOTPATH OR A ROUGH CART TRACK
2391-145015-0014 AND NOW AND THEN THE UNWELCOME ADDER TWO SUCH HEDGEROWS RADIATED AS IT WERE FROM THE PARSONAGE GARDEN ONE A CONTINUATION OF THE TURF TERRACE PROCEEDED WESTWARD FORMING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY OF THE HOME MEADOWS
2391-145015-0015 AND WAS FORMED INTO A RUSTIC SHRUBBERY WITH OCCASIONAL SEATS ENTITLED THE WOOD WALK THE OTHER RAN STRAIGHT UP THE HILL UNDER THE NAME OF THE CHURCH WALK BECAUSE IT LED TO THE PARISH CHURCH
2391-145015-0016 WHO HAVE FOR MORE THAN A CENTURY RENTED IT TOGETHER WITH THE CHIEF FARM IN THE PARISH THE CHURCH ITSELF I SPEAK OF IT AS IT THEN WAS BEFORE THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE BY THE PRESENT RECTOR
2391-145015-0017 MIGHT HAVE APPEARED MEAN AND UNINTERESTING TO AN ORDINARY OBSERVER BUT THE ADEPT IN CHURCH ARCHITECTURE WOULD HAVE KNOWN THAT IT MUST HAVE STOOD THERE SOME SEVEN CENTURIES AND WOULD HAVE FOUND BEAUTY IN THE VERY NARROW EARLY ENGLISH WINDOWS
2391-145015-0018 WHILE ITS SOLITARY POSITION FAR FROM THE HUM OF THE VILLAGE AND WITHIN SIGHT OF NO HABITATION EXCEPT A GLIMPSE OF THE GRAY MANOR HOUSE THROUGH ITS CIRCLING SCREEN OF SYCAMORES HAS IN IT SOMETHING SOLEMN AND APPROPRIATE TO THE LAST RESTING PLACE OF THE SILENT DEAD
2391-145015-0019 SWEET VIOLETS BOTH PURPLE AND WHITE GROW IN ABUNDANCE BENEATH ITS SOUTH WALL ONE MAY IMAGINE FOR HOW MANY CENTURIES THE ANCESTORS OF THOSE LITTLE FLOWERS HAVE OCCUPIED THAT UNDISTURBED SUNNY NOOK
2391-145015-0020 THICK COMING FANCIES ROSE IN HER MIND AND GRADUALLY ASSUMED THE FORMS IN WHICH THEY CAME FORTH TO THE WORLD
2391-145015-0021 THE FAMILY WAS UNBROKEN BY DEATH AND SELDOM VISITED BY SORROW THEIR SITUATION HAD SOME PECULIAR ADVANTAGES BEYOND THOSE OF ORDINARY RECTORIES STEVENTON WAS A FAMILY LIVING MISTER KNIGHT THE PATRON WAS ALSO PROPRIETOR OF NEARLY THE WHOLE PARISH
2391-145015-0022 THEY SHARED WITH THE PRINCIPAL TENANT THE COMMAND OF AN EXCELLENT MANOR AND ENJOYED IN THIS REFLECTED WAY SOME OF THE CONSIDERATION USUALLY AWARDED TO LANDED PROPRIETORS
2391-145015-0023 THEY HAD ENOUGH TO AFFORD A GOOD EDUCATION TO THEIR SONS AND DAUGHTERS TO MIX IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD AND TO EXERCISE A LIBERAL HOSPITALITY TO THEIR OWN RELATIONS AND FRIENDS A CARRIAGE AND A PAIR OF HORSES WERE KEPT
2391-145015-0024 THIS MIGHT IMPLY A HIGHER STYLE OF LIVING IN OUR DAYS THAN IT DID IN THEIRS THERE WERE THEN NO ASSESSED TAXES THE CARRIAGE ONCE BOUGHT ENTAILED LITTLE FURTHER EXPENSE AND THE HORSES PROBABLY LIKE MISTER BENNET'S WERE OFTEN EMPLOYED ON FARM WORK
2391-145015-0025 MOREOVER IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT A PAIR OF HORSES IN THOSE DAYS WERE ALMOST NECESSARY IF LADIES WERE TO MOVE ABOUT AT ALL
2391-145015-0026 WHEN ONE LOOKS AT THE FEW SPECIMENS STILL REMAINING OF COACH BUILDING IN THE LAST CENTURY IT STRIKES ONE THAT THE CHIEF OBJECT OF THE BUILDERS MUST HAVE BEEN TO COMBINE THE GREATEST POSSIBLE WEIGHT WITH THE LEAST POSSIBLE AMOUNT OF ACCOMMODATION
2391-145015-0027 THE FAMILY LIVED IN CLOSE INTIMACY WITH TWO COUSINS EDWARD AND JANE COOPER THE CHILDREN OF MISSUS AUSTEN'S ELDEST SISTER AND DOCTOR COOPER THE VICAR OF SONNING NEAR READING THE COOPERS LIVED FOR SOME YEARS AT BATH
2391-145015-0028 I BELIEVE THAT CASSANDRA AND JANE SOMETIMES VISITED THEM THERE AND THAT JANE THUS ACQUIRED THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPOGRAPHY AND CUSTOMS OF BATH WHICH ENABLED HER TO WRITE NORTHANGER ABBEY LONG BEFORE SHE RESIDED THERE HERSELF
2391-145015-0029 AFTER THE DEATH OF THEIR OWN PARENTS THE TWO YOUNG COOPERS PAID LONG VISITS AT STEVENTON EDWARD COOPER DID NOT LIVE UNDISTINGUISHED
2391-145015-0030 AND IN LATER LIFE HE WAS KNOWN BY A WORK ON PROPHECY CALLED THE CRISIS AND OTHER RELIGIOUS PUBLICATIONS ESPECIALLY FOR SEVERAL VOLUMES OF SERMONS MUCH PREACHED IN MANY PULPITS IN MY YOUTH
2391-145015-0031 JANE COOPER WAS MARRIED FROM HER UNCLE'S HOUSE AT STEVENTON TO CAPTAIN AFTERWARDS SIR THOMAS WILLIAMS UNDER WHOM CHARLES AUSTEN SERVED IN SEVERAL SHIPS SHE WAS A DEAR FRIEND OF HER NAMESAKE
2391-145015-0032 BUT WAS FATED TO BECOME A CAUSE OF GREAT SORROW TO HER FOR A FEW YEARS AFTER THE MARRIAGE SHE WAS SUDDENLY KILLED BY AN ACCIDENT TO HER CARRIAGE THERE WAS ANOTHER COUSIN CLOSELY ASSOCIATED WITH THEM AT STEVENTON
2391-145015-0033 WHO MUST HAVE INTRODUCED GREATER VARIETY INTO THE FAMILY CIRCLE THIS WAS THE DAUGHTER OF MISTER AUSTEN'S ONLY SISTER MISSUS HANCOCK
2391-145015-0034 OF WHOM I KNOW LITTLE MORE THAN THAT HE PERISHED BY THE GUILLOTINE DURING THE FRENCH REVOLUTION PERHAPS HIS CHIEF OFFENCE WAS HIS RANK BUT IT WAS SAID THAT THE CHARGE OF INCIVISM UNDER WHICH HE SUFFERED RESTED ON THE FACT OF HIS HAVING LAID DOWN SOME ARABLE LAND INTO PASTURE
2391-145015-0035 HIS WIFE ESCAPED THROUGH DANGERS AND DIFFICULTIES TO ENGLAND WAS RECEIVED FOR SOME TIME INTO HER UNCLE'S FAMILY AND FINALLY MARRIED HER COUSIN HENRY AUSTEN
2391-145015-0036 SHE AND HER SECOND HUSBAND WENT TO FRANCE IN THE HOPE OF RECOVERING SOME OF THE COUNT'S PROPERTY AND THERE NARROWLY ESCAPED BEING INCLUDED AMONGST THE DETENUS ORDERS HAD BEEN GIVEN BY BUONAPARTE'S GOVERNMENT TO DETAIN ALL ENGLISH TRAVELLERS
2391-145015-0037 BUT AT THE POST HOUSES MISSUS HENRY AUSTEN GAVE THE NECESSARY ORDERS HERSELF AND HER FRENCH WAS SO PERFECT THAT SHE PASSED EVERYWHERE FOR A NATIVE
2391-145015-0038 SHE WAS A CLEVER WOMAN AND HIGHLY ACCOMPLISHED AFTER THE FRENCH RATHER THAN THE ENGLISH MODE AND IN THOSE DAYS WHEN INTERCOURSE WITH THE CONTINENT WAS LONG INTERRUPTED BY WAR SUCH AN ELEMENT IN THE SOCIETY OF A COUNTRY PARSONAGE MUST HAVE BEEN A RARE ACQUISITION
2391-145015-0039 THE SISTERS MAY HAVE BEEN MORE INDEBTED TO THIS COUSIN THAN TO MISSUS LA TOURNELLE'S TEACHING FOR THE CONSIDERABLE KNOWLEDGE OF FRENCH WHICH THEY POSSESSED SHE ALSO TOOK THE PRINCIPAL PARTS IN THE PRIVATE THEATRICALS IN WHICH THE FAMILY SEVERAL TIMES INDULGED
2391-145015-0040 HAVING THEIR SUMMER THEATRE IN THE BARN AND THEIR WINTER ONE WITHIN THE NARROW LIMITS OF THE DINING ROOM WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE AUDIENCE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LIMITED ON THESE OCCASIONS THE PROLOGUES AND EPILOGUES WERE WRITTEN BY JANE'S ELDEST BROTHER
2391-145015-0041 AND SOME OF THEM ARE VERY VIGOROUS AND AMUSING JANE WAS ONLY TWELVE YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF THE EARLIEST OF THESE REPRESENTATIONS AND NOT MORE THAN FIFTEEN WHEN THE LAST TOOK PLACE SHE WAS HOWEVER AN EARLY OBSERVER
2391-145015-0042 AND IT MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED THAT SOME OF THE INCIDENTS AND FEELINGS WHICH ARE SO VIVIDLY PAINTED IN THE MANSFIELD PARK THEATRICALS ARE DUE TO HER RECOLLECTIONS OF THESE ENTERTAINMENTS SOME TIME BEFORE THEY LEFT STEVENTON ONE GREAT AFFLICTION CAME UPON THE FAMILY
2391-145015-0043 HE ACCOMPANIED THIS FRIEND TO THE WEST INDIES AS CHAPLAIN TO HIS REGIMENT AND THERE DIED OF YELLOW FEVER TO THE GREAT CONCERN OF HIS FRIEND AND PATRON WHO AFTERWARDS DECLARED THAT IF HE HAD KNOWN OF THE ENGAGEMENT HE WOULD NOT HAVE PERMITTED HIM TO GO OUT TO SUCH A CLIMATE
2391-145015-0044 THIS LITTLE DOMESTIC TRAGEDY CAUSED GREAT AND LASTING GRIEF TO THE PRINCIPAL SUFFERER AND COULD NOT BUT CAST A GLOOM OVER THE WHOLE PARTY THE SYMPATHY OF JANE WAS PROBABLY FROM HER AGE AND HER PECULIAR ATTACHMENT TO HER SISTER
2391-145015-0045 HER REVIEWER IN THE QUARTERLY OF JANUARY EIGHTEEN TWENTY ONE OBSERVES CONCERNING THE ATTACHMENT OF FANNY PRICE TO EDMUND BERTRAM THE SILENCE IN WHICH THIS PASSION IS CHERISHED THE SLENDER HOPES AND ENJOYMENTS BY WHICH IT IS FED
2391-145015-0046 THE RESTLESSNESS AND JEALOUSY WITH WHICH IT FILLS A MIND NATURALLY ACTIVE CONTENTED AND UNSUSPICIOUS THE MANNER IN WHICH IT TINGES EVERY EVENT AND EVERY REFLECTION ARE PAINTED WITH A VIVIDNESS AND A DETAIL OF WHICH WE CAN SCARCELY CONCEIVE ANY ONE BUT A FEMALE
2391-145015-0047 AND WE SHOULD ALMOST ADD A FEMALE WRITING FROM RECOLLECTION CAPABLE THIS CONJECTURE HOWEVER PROBABLE WAS WIDE OF THE MARK THE PICTURE WAS DRAWN FROM THE INTUITIVE PERCEPTIONS OF GENIUS NOT FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
2391-145015-0048 IN NO CIRCUMSTANCE OF HER LIFE WAS THERE ANY SIMILARITY BETWEEN HERSELF AND HER HEROINE IN MANSFIELD PARK
2391-145015-0049 IN HER YOUTH SHE HAD DECLINED THE ADDRESSES OF A GENTLEMAN WHO HAD THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF GOOD CHARACTER AND CONNECTIONS AND POSITION IN LIFE OF EVERYTHING IN FACT EXCEPT THE SUBTLE POWER OF TOUCHING HER HEART
2391-145015-0050 THERE IS HOWEVER ONE PASSAGE OF ROMANCE IN HER HISTORY WITH WHICH I AM IMPERFECTLY ACQUAINTED AND TO WHICH I AM UNABLE TO ASSIGN NAME OR DATE OR PLACE THOUGH I HAVE IT ON SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY
2391-145015-0051 MANY YEARS AFTER HER DEATH SOME CIRCUMSTANCES INDUCED HER SISTER CASSANDRA TO BREAK THROUGH HER HABITUAL RETICENCE AND TO SPEAK OF IT
2391-145015-0052 WHOSE CHARM OF PERSON MIND AND MANNERS WAS SUCH THAT CASSANDRA THOUGHT HIM WORTHY TO POSSESS AND LIKELY TO WIN HER SISTER'S LOVE WHEN THEY PARTED
2391-145015-0053 AND CASSANDRA FELT NO DOUBT AS TO HIS MOTIVES BUT THEY NEVER AGAIN MET WITHIN A SHORT TIME THEY HEARD OF HIS SUDDEN DEATH I BELIEVE THAT IF JANE EVER LOVED IT WAS THIS UNNAMED GENTLEMAN BUT THE ACQUAINTANCE HAD BEEN SHORT
2391-145015-0054 ANY DESCRIPTION THAT I MIGHT ATTEMPT OF THE FAMILY LIFE AT STEVENTON WHICH CLOSED SOON AFTER I WAS BORN COULD BE LITTLE BETTER THAN A FANCY PIECE
2391-145015-0055 WOULD SEEM STRANGE TO US AND SHOULD MISS MANY MORE TO WHICH WE ARE ACCUSTOMED EVERY HUNDRED YEARS AND ESPECIALLY A CENTURY LIKE THE LAST MARKED BY AN EXTRAORDINARY ADVANCE IN WEALTH LUXURY AND REFINEMENT OF TASTE AS WELL AS IN THE MECHANICAL ARTS WHICH EMBELLISH OUR HOUSES
2391-145015-0056 MUST PRODUCE A GREAT CHANGE IN THEIR ASPECT THESE CHANGES ARE ALWAYS AT WORK THEY ARE GOING ON NOW BUT SO SILENTLY THAT WE TAKE NO NOTE OF THEM MEN SOON FORGET THE SMALL OBJECTS WHICH THEY LEAVE BEHIND THEM AS THEY DRIFT DOWN THE STREAM OF LIFE
2391-145015-0057 AS POPE SAYS NOR DOES LIFE'S STREAM FOR OBSERVATION STAY IT HURRIES ALL TOO FAST TO MARK THEIR WAY IMPORTANT INVENTIONS SUCH AS THE APPLICATIONS OF STEAM GAS AND ELECTRICITY MAY FIND THEIR PLACES IN HISTORY
2391-145015-0058 WHO CAN NOW RECORD THE DEGREES BY WHICH THE CUSTOM PREVALENT IN MY YOUTH OF ASKING EACH OTHER TO TAKE WINE TOGETHER AT DINNER BECAME OBSOLETE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO FIX TWENTY YEARS HENCE THE DATE WHEN OUR DINNERS BEGAN TO BE CARVED AND HANDED ROUND BY SERVANTS
2391-145015-0059 INSTEAD OF SMOKING BEFORE OUR EYES AND NOSES ON THE TABLE TO RECORD SUCH LITTLE MATTERS WOULD INDEED BE TO CHRONICLE SMALL BEER
2391-145015-0060 BUT WHICH THE HISTORIAN HAS THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN RECOVERING AT THAT TIME THE DINNER TABLE PRESENTED A FAR LESS SPLENDID APPEARANCE THAN IT DOES NOW IT WAS APPROPRIATED TO SOLID FOOD RATHER THAN TO FLOWERS FRUITS AND DECORATIONS
2391-145015-0061 NOR WAS THERE MUCH GLITTER OF PLATE UPON IT FOR THE EARLY DINNER HOUR RENDERED CANDLESTICKS UNNECESSARY
2391-145015-0062 THOUGH NOT LESS PLENTIFUL AND SAVOURY AND THE BILL OF FARE IN ONE HOUSE WOULD NOT BE SO LIKE THAT IN ANOTHER AS IT IS NOW FOR FAMILY RECEIPTS WERE HELD IN HIGH ESTIMATION
2391-145015-0063 AND MIGHT INFLUENCE THE FAMILY DINNER FOR MANY GENERATIONS
2391-145015-0064 ONE HOUSE WOULD PRIDE ITSELF ON ITS HAM ANOTHER ON ITS GAME PIE AND A THIRD ON ITS SUPERIOR FURMITY OR TANSEY PUDDING BEER AND HOME MADE WINES ESPECIALLY MEAD WERE MORE LARGELY CONSUMED VEGETABLES WERE LESS PLENTIFUL AND LESS VARIOUS
2391-145015-0065 POTATOES WERE USED BUT NOT SO ABUNDANTLY AS NOW AND THERE WAS AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE TO BE EATEN ONLY WITH ROAST MEAT THEY WERE NOVELTIES TO A TENANT'S WIFE WHO WAS ENTERTAINED AT STEVENTON PARSONAGE CERTAINLY LESS THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO
2391-145015-0066 AND WHEN MISSUS AUSTEN ADVISED HER TO PLANT THEM IN HER OWN GARDEN SHE REPLIED NO NO THEY ARE VERY WELL FOR YOU GENTRY BUT THEY MUST BE TERRIBLY COSTLY TO REAR BUT A STILL GREATER DIFFERENCE WOULD BE FOUND IN THE FURNITURE OF THE ROOMS
2391-145015-0067 WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO US LAMENTABLY SCANTY THERE WAS A GENERAL DEFICIENCY OF CARPETING IN SITTING ROOMS BED ROOMS AND PASSAGES A PIANOFORTE OR RATHER A SPINNET OR HARPSICHORD WAS BY NO MEANS A NECESSARY APPENDAGE
2391-145015-0068 IT WAS TO BE FOUND ONLY WHERE THERE WAS A DECIDED TASTE FOR MUSIC NOT SO COMMON THEN AS NOW OR IN SUCH GREAT HOUSES AS WOULD PROBABLY CONTAIN A BILLIARD TABLE THERE WOULD OFTEN BE BUT ONE SOFA IN THE HOUSE AND THAT A STIFF ANGULAR
2391-145015-0069 UNCOMFORTABLE ARTICLE THERE WERE NO DEEP EASY CHAIRS NOR OTHER APPLIANCES FOR LOUNGING FOR TO LIE DOWN OR EVEN TO LEAN BACK WAS A LUXURY PERMITTED ONLY TO OLD PERSONS OR INVALIDS
2391-145015-0070 AND A MODEL GENTLEMAN OF HIS DAY THAT HE WOULD HAVE MADE THE TOUR OF EUROPE WITHOUT EVER TOUCHING THE BACK OF HIS TRAVELLING CARRIAGE BUT PERHAPS WE SHOULD BE MOST STRUCK WITH THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THOSE ELEGANT LITTLE ARTICLES WHICH NOW EMBELLISH AND ENCUMBER OUR DRAWING ROOM TABLES
2391-145015-0071 WE SHOULD MISS THE SLIDING BOOKCASES AND PICTURE STANDS
2391-145015-0072 THE PERIODICALS AND ILLUSTRATED NEWSPAPERS ABOVE ALL
2391-145015-0073 A SMALL WRITING DESK WITH A SMALLER WORK BOX OR NETTING CASE WAS ALL THAT EACH YOUNG LADY CONTRIBUTED TO OCCUPY THE TABLE FOR THE LARGE FAMILY WORK BASKET THOUGH OFTEN PRODUCED IN THE PARLOUR LIVED IN THE CLOSET
2391-145015-0074 THERE MUST HAVE BEEN MORE DANCING THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY IN THOSE DAYS THAN THERE IS NOW
2391-145015-0075 AS IF IT WERE A NATURAL PRODUCTION WITH LESS FASTIDIOUSNESS AS TO THE QUALITY OF MUSIC LIGHTS AND FLOOR MANY COUNTRY TOWNS HAD A MONTHLY BALL THROUGHOUT THE WINTER IN SOME OF WHICH THE SAME APARTMENT SERVED FOR DANCING AND TEA ROOM
2391-145015-0076 TO THE MUSIC OF A HARPSICHORD IN THE HOUSE OR A FIDDLE FROM THE VILLAGE THIS WAS ALWAYS SUPPOSED TO BE FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF THE YOUNG PEOPLE
2391-145015-0077 FOR SHE ATTRIBUTES THIS TASTE TO HER FAVOURITE HEROINES
2391-145015-0078 AND MADE OF IMPORTANCE MANY THINGS CONNECTED WITH THE BALL ROOMS OF THOSE DAYS HAVE NOW PASSED INTO OBLIVION THE BARBAROUS LAW WHICH CONFINED THE LADY TO ONE PARTNER THROUGHOUT THE EVENING MUST INDEED HAVE BEEN ABOLISHED BEFORE JANE WENT TO BALLS
2391-145015-0079 IT MUST BE OBSERVED HOWEVER THAT THIS CUSTOM WAS IN ONE RESPECT ADVANTAGEOUS TO THE GENTLEMAN INASMUCH AS IT RENDERED HIS DUTIES MORE PRACTICABLE HE WAS BOUND TO CALL UPON HIS PARTNER THE NEXT MORNING
2391-145015-0080 TO GALLOP ALL THE COUNTRY OVER THE LAST NIGHT'S PARTNER TO BEHOLD AND HUMBLY HOPE SHE CAUGHT NO COLD BUT THE STATELY MINUET STILL REIGNED SUPREME AND EVERY REGULAR BALL COMMENCED WITH IT IT WAS A SLOW AND SOLEMN MOVEMENT
2391-145015-0081 EXPRESSIVE OF GRACE AND DIGNITY RATHER THAN OF MERRIMENT IT ABOUNDED IN FORMAL BOWS AND COURTESIES WITH MEASURED PACES FORWARDS BACKWARDS AND SIDEWAYS AND MANY COMPLICATED GYRATIONS
2391-145015-0082 IT WAS EXECUTED BY ONE LADY AND GENTLEMAN AMIDST THE ADMIRATION OR THE CRITICISM OF SURROUNDING SPECTATORS IN ITS EARLIER AND MOST PALMY DAYS AS WHEN SIR CHARLES AND LADY GRANDISON DELIGHTED THE COMPANY BY DANCING IT AT THEIR OWN WEDDING
2391-145015-0083 THE GENTLEMAN WORE A DRESS SWORD AND THE LADY WAS ARMED WITH A FAN OF NEARLY EQUAL DIMENSIONS ADDISON OBSERVES THAT WOMEN ARE ARMED WITH FANS AS MEN WITH SWORDS AND SOMETIMES DO MORE EXECUTION WITH THEM
2391-145015-0084 THE GRACEFUL CARRIAGE OF EACH WEAPON WAS CONSIDERED A TEST OF HIGH BREEDING THE CLOWNISH MAN WAS IN DANGER OF BEING TRIPPED UP BY HIS SWORD GETTING BETWEEN HIS LEGS
2391-145015-0085 AND I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THOSE LADIES WHO INTENDED TO DANCE MINUETS USED TO DISTINGUISH THEMSELVES FROM OTHERS BY WEARING A PARTICULAR KIND OF LAPPET ON THEIR HEAD DRESS I HAVE HEARD ALSO OF ANOTHER CURIOUS PROOF OF THE RESPECT IN WHICH THIS DANCE WAS HELD
2391-145015-0086 GLOVES IMMACULATELY CLEAN WERE CONSIDERED REQUISITE FOR ITS DUE PERFORMANCE WHILE GLOVES A LITTLE SOILED WERE THOUGHT GOOD ENOUGH FOR A COUNTRY DANCE AND ACCORDINGLY SOME PRUDENT LADIES PROVIDED THEMSELVES WITH TWO PAIRS FOR THEIR SEVERAL PURPOSES
2391-145015-0087 THE MINUET EXPIRED WITH THE LAST CENTURY BUT LONG AFTER IT HAD CEASED TO BE DANCED PUBLICLY IT WAS TAUGHT TO BOYS AND GIRLS IN ORDER TO GIVE THEM A GRACEFUL CARRIAGE HORNPIPES COTILLONS AND REELS WERE OCCASIONALLY DANCED
2391-145015-0088 BUT THE CHIEF OCCUPATION OF THE EVENING WAS THE INTERMINABLE COUNTRY DANCE IN WHICH ALL COULD JOIN THIS DANCE PRESENTED A GREAT SHOW OF ENJOYMENT BUT IT WAS NOT WITHOUT ITS PECULIAR TROUBLES
2391-145015-0089 THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WERE RANGED APART FROM EACH OTHER IN OPPOSITE ROWS SO THAT THE FACILITIES FOR FLIRTATION OR INTERESTING INTERCOURSE WERE NOT SO GREAT AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN DESIRED BY BOTH PARTIES MUCH HEART BURNING AND DISCONTENT SOMETIMES AROSE AS TO WHO SHOULD STAND ABOVE WHOM
2391-145015-0090 AND ESPECIALLY AS TO WHO WAS ENTITLED TO THE HIGH PRIVILEGE OF CALLING AND LEADING OFF THE FIRST DANCE AND NO LITTLE INDIGNATION WAS FELT AT THE LOWER END OF THE ROOM WHEN ANY OF THE LEADING COUPLES RETIRED PREMATURELY FROM THEIR DUTIES AND DID NOT CONDESCEND TO DANCE UP AND DOWN THE WHOLE SET
2391-145015-0091 WE MAY REJOICE THAT THESE CAUSES OF IRRITATION NO LONGER EXIST AND THAT IF SUCH FEELINGS AS JEALOUSY RIVALRY AND DISCONTENT EVER TOUCH CELESTIAL BOSOMS IN THE MODERN BALL ROOM THEY MUST ARISE FROM DIFFERENT AND MORE RECONDITE SOURCES
2391-145015-0092 I AM TEMPTED TO ADD A LITTLE ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE OF PERSONAL HABITS IT MAY BE ASSERTED AS A GENERAL TRUTH THAT LESS WAS LEFT TO THE CHARGE AND DISCRETION OF SERVANTS AND MORE WAS DONE OR SUPERINTENDED BY THE MASTERS AND MISTRESSES
2391-145015-0093 WITH REGARD TO THE MISTRESSES IT IS I BELIEVE GENERALLY UNDERSTOOD THAT AT THE TIME TO WHICH I REFER A HUNDRED YEARS AGO THEY TOOK A PERSONAL PART IN THE HIGHER BRANCHES OF COOKERY AS WELL AS IN THE CONCOCTION OF HOME MADE WINES
2391-145015-0094 AND DISTILLING OF HERBS FOR DOMESTIC MEDICINES WHICH ARE NEARLY ALLIED TO THE SAME ART LADIES DID NOT DISDAIN TO SPIN THE THREAD OF WHICH THE HOUSEHOLD LINEN WAS WOVEN SOME LADIES LIKED TO WASH WITH THEIR OWN HANDS THEIR CHOICE CHINA AFTER BREAKFAST OR TEA
2391-145015-0095 AS THAT THEY TOOK AN INTEREST IN SUCH OCCUPATIONS AND IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND HOW MANY SOURCES OF INTEREST ENJOYED BY THIS GENERATION WERE THEN CLOSED OR VERY SCANTILY OPENED TO LADIES A VERY SMALL MINORITY OF THEM CARED MUCH FOR LITERATURE OR SCIENCE
2391-145015-0096 BUT I DOUBT WHETHER THE RISING GENERATION ARE EQUALLY AWARE HOW MUCH GENTLEMEN ALSO DID FOR THEMSELVES IN THOSE TIMES
2391-145015-0097 THAN THEY ARE NOW MASTER'S EYE MAKES THE HORSE FAT AND IF YOU WOULD BE WELL SERVED SERVE YOURSELF SOME GENTLEMEN TOOK PLEASURE IN BEING THEIR OWN GARDENERS PERFORMING ALL THE SCIENTIFIC AND SOME OF THE MANUAL WORK THEMSELVES
2391-145015-0098 WELL DRESSED YOUNG MEN OF MY ACQUAINTANCE WHO HAD THEIR COAT FROM A LONDON TAILOR WOULD ALWAYS BRUSH THEIR EVENING SUIT THEMSELVES RATHER THAN ENTRUST IT TO THE CARELESSNESS OF A ROUGH SERVANT AND TO THE RISKS OF DIRT AND GREASE IN THE KITCHEN
2391-145015-0099 FOR IN THOSE DAYS SERVANTS HALLS WERE NOT COMMON IN THE HOUSES OF THE CLERGY AND THE SMALLER COUNTRY GENTRY IT WAS QUITE NATURAL THAT CATHERINE MORLAND SHOULD HAVE CONTRASTED THE MAGNIFICENCE OF THE OFFICES AT NORTHANGER ABBEY WITH THE FEW SHAPELESS PANTRIES IN HER FATHER'S PARSONAGE
2391-145015-0100 A YOUNG MAN WHO EXPECTED TO HAVE HIS THINGS PACKED OR UNPACKED FOR HIM BY A SERVANT WHEN HE TRAVELLED
2391-145015-0101 IT WAS THOUGHT MERITORIOUS ON THE EVENING OF A HUNTING DAY TO TURN OUT AFTER DINNER LANTHORN IN HAND AND VISIT THE STABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE HORSE HAD BEEN WELL CARED FOR THIS WAS OF THE MORE IMPORTANCE BECAUSE PREVIOUS TO THE INTRODUCTION OF CLIPPING ABOUT THE YEAR EIGHTEEN TWENTY
2391-145015-0102 IT WAS A DIFFICULT AND TEDIOUS WORK TO MAKE A LONG COATED HUNTER DRY AND COMFORTABLE AND WAS OFTEN VERY IMPERFECTLY DONE OF COURSE SUCH THINGS WERE NOT PRACTISED BY THOSE WHO HAD GAMEKEEPERS AND STUD GROOMS AND PLENTY OF WELL TRAINED SERVANTS
2391-145015-0103 BUT THEY WERE PRACTISED BY MANY WHO WERE UNEQUIVOCALLY GENTLEMEN AND WHOSE GRANDSONS OCCUPYING THE SAME POSITION IN LIFE MAY PERHAPS BE ASTONISHED AT BEING TOLD THAT SUCH THINGS WERE
2391-145015-0104 OF COURSE THEY CANNOT BE UNIVERSALLY APPLICABLE SUCH DETAILS VARIED IN VARIOUS CIRCLES AND WERE CHANGED VERY GRADUALLY
2391-145015-0105 BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THEIR WAY OF LIFE DIFFERED A LITTLE FROM OURS
2391-145015-0106 IT MAY BE THAT USEFUL ARTICLES WHICH WOULD NOT NOW BE PRODUCED IN DRAWING ROOMS WERE HEMMED AND MARKED AND DARNED IN THE OLD FASHIONED PARLOUR BUT ALL THIS CONCERNED ONLY THE OUTER LIFE THERE WAS AS MUCH CULTIVATION AND REFINEMENT OF MIND AS NOW
2391-145015-0107 THE EARLY HOUR AT WHICH HOUNDS THEN MET MAY ACCOUNT FOR THIS
2391-145015-0108 FOR THEY HUNTED AT AN EARLY AGE IN A SCRAMBLING SORT OF WAY UPON ANY PONY OR DONKEY THAT THEY COULD PROCURE OR IN DEFAULT OF SUCH LUXURIES ON FOOT I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT SIR FRANCIS AUSTEN WHEN SEVEN YEARS OLD
2391-145015-0109 BOUGHT ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT IT MUST BE SUPPOSED WITH HIS FATHER'S PERMISSION A PONY FOR A GUINEA AND A HALF AND AFTER RIDING HIM WITH GREAT SUCCESS FOR TWO SEASONS SOLD HIM FOR A GUINEA MORE
2391-145015-0110 THE SAME AUTHORITY INFORMS ME THAT HIS FIRST CLOTH SUIT WAS MADE FROM A SCARLET HABIT WHICH ACCORDING TO THE FASHION OF THE TIMES HAD BEEN HIS MOTHER'S USUAL MORNING DRESS IF ALL THIS IS TRUE
2391-145015-0111 THE FUTURE ADMIRAL OF THE BRITISH FLEET MUST HAVE CUT A CONSPICUOUS FIGURE IN THE HUNTING FIELD THE OTHER PECULIARITY WAS THAT WHEN THE ROADS WERE DIRTY THE SISTERS TOOK LONG WALKS IN PATTENS THIS DEFENCE AGAINST WET AND DIRT IS NOW SELDOM SEEN
2391-145015-0112 THE FEW THAT REMAIN ARE BANISHED FROM GOOD SOCIETY AND EMPLOYED ONLY IN MENIAL WORK BUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO THEY WERE CELEBRATED IN POETRY AND CONSIDERED SO CLEVER A CONTRIVANCE THAT GAY IN HIS TRIVIA
2391-145015-0113 ASCRIBES THE INVENTION TO A GOD STIMULATED BY HIS PASSION FOR A MORTAL DAMSEL AND DERIVES THE NAME PATTEN FROM PATTY THE PATTEN NOW SUPPORTS EACH FRUGAL DAME WHICH FROM THE BLUE EYED PATTY TAKES THE NAME
2391-145015-0114 BUT MORTAL DAMSELS HAVE LONG AGO DISCARDED THE CLUMSY IMPLEMENT FIRST IT DROPPED ITS IRON RING AND BECAME A CLOG AFTERWARDS IT WAS FINED DOWN INTO THE PLIANT GALOSHE LIGHTER TO WEAR AND MORE EFFECTUAL TO PROTECT
2391-145015-0115 A NO LESS MANIFEST INSTANCE OF GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT THAN COWPER INDICATES WHEN HE TRACES THROUGH EIGHTY LINES OF POETRY HIS ACCOMPLISHED SOFA BACK TO THE ORIGINAL THREE LEGGED STOOL
2391-145015-0116 I ADD THE FOLLOWING EPIGRAM WRITTEN BY JANE AUSTEN'S UNCLE MISTER LEIGH PERROT ON READING IN A NEWSPAPER THE MARRIAGE OF CAPTAIN FOOTE TO MISS PATTEN THROUGH THE ROUGH PATHS OF LIFE WITH A PATTEN YOUR GUARD MAY YOU SAFELY AND PLEASANTLY JOG
2391-145015-0117 MAY THE KNOT NEVER SLIP NOR THE RING PRESS TOO HARD NOR THE FOOT FIND THE PATTEN A CLOG AT THE TIME WHEN JANE AUSTEN LIVED AT STEVENTON A WORK WAS CARRIED ON IN THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES WHICH OUGHT TO BE RECORDED BECAUSE IT HAS LONG CEASED TO EXIST
2391-145015-0118 THIS WAS A BETTER OCCUPATION FOR THEM THAN STRAW PLAITING
2391-145015-0119 AND DID NOT ADMIT OF GADDING AND GOSSIPING ABOUT THE VILLAGE THE IMPLEMENT USED WAS A LONG NARROW MACHINE OF WOOD RAISED ON LEGS FURNISHED AT ONE END WITH A LARGE WHEEL AND AT THE OTHER WITH A SPINDLE ON WHICH THE FLAX OR WOOL WAS LOOSELY WRAPPED
2391-145015-0120 BALLAD POETRY AND FAIRY TALES ARE FULL OF ALLUSIONS TO IT
2391-145015-0121 IT WAS THE LABOUR ASSIGNED TO THE EJECTED NUNS BY THE ROUGH EARL WHO SAID GO SPIN YE JADES GO SPIN IT WAS THE EMPLOYMENT AT WHICH ROMAN MATRONS AND GRECIAN PRINCESSES PRESIDED AMONGST THEIR HANDMAIDS
2391-145015-0122 HEATHEN MYTHOLOGY CELEBRATED IT IN THE THREE FATES SPINNING AND MEASURING OUT THE THREAD OF HUMAN LIFE
2416-152137-0000 A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE AND A SILVERY LAUGH JUST THAT NO MORE JIMMIE DALE IN HIS FAVOURITE SEAT AN AISLE SEAT SOME SEVEN OR EIGHT ROWS BACK FROM THE ORCHESTRA STARED AT THE STAGE
2416-152137-0001 TO ALL OUTWARD APPEARANCES ABSORBED IN THE LAST ACT OF THE PLAY INWARDLY QUITE OBLIVIOUS TO THE FACT THAT EVEN A PLAY WAS GOING ON A WHITE GLOVED ARM A VOICE
2416-152137-0002 AND A SILVERY LAUGH THE WORDS HAD FORMED THEMSELVES INTO A SORT OF SINGSONG REFRAIN THAT FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAD BEEN RUNNING THROUGH HIS HEAD A STRANGE ENOUGH GUIDING STAR TO MOULD AND DICTATE EVERY ACTION IN HIS LIFE
2416-152137-0003 AND THAT WAS ALL HE HAD EVER SEEN OF HER ALL THAT HE HAD EVER HEARD OF HER EXCEPT THOSE LETTERS OF COURSE EACH OF WHICH HAD OUTLINED THE DETAILS OF SOME AFFAIR FOR THE GRAY SEAL TO EXECUTE
2416-152137-0004 INDEED IT SEEMED A GREAT LENGTH OF TIME NOW SINCE HE HAD HEARD FROM HER EVEN IN THAT WAY THOUGH IT WAS NOT SO MANY DAYS AGO AFTER ALL PERHAPS IT WAS THE CALM AS IT WERE THAT BY CONTRAST
2416-152137-0005 HAD GIVEN PLACE TO THE STRENUOUS MONTHS AND WEEKS JUST PAST THE STORM RAISED BY THE NEWSPAPERS AT THE THEFT OF OLD LUDDY'S DIAMONDS HAD SUBSIDED INTO SPORADIC DIATRIBES AIMED AT THE POLICE KLINE
2416-152137-0006 OF THE SECRET SERVICE HAD FINALLY ADMITTED DEFEAT AND A SHADOW NO LONGER SKULKED DAY AND NIGHT AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE SANCTUARY AND LARRY THE BAT BORE THE GOVERNMENT INDORSEMENT SO TO SPEAK OF BEING NO MORE SUSPICIOUS A CHARACTER
2416-152137-0007 THAN THAT OF A DISREPUTABLE BUT HARMLESS DOPE FIEND OF THE UNDERWORLD LARRY THE BAT THE GRAY SEAL JIMMIE DALE THE MILLIONAIRE
2416-152137-0008 SUBCONSCIOUSLY TELEGRAPHING TO HIS MIND THE FACT THAT THE TEXTURE OF THE PAPER WAS HERS HERS AND SHE MUST BE ONE OF THOSE AROUND HIM ONE OF THOSE CROWDING EITHER THE ROW OF SEATS IN FRONT OR BEHIND
2416-152137-0009 OR ONE OF THOSE JUST PASSING IN THE AISLE IT HAD FALLEN AT HIS FEET AS HE HAD STOOPED OVER FOR HIS HAT BUT FROM JUST EXACTLY WHAT DIRECTION HE COULD NOT TELL HIS EYES EAGERLY HUNGRILY
2416-152137-0010 CRITICALLY SWEPT FACE AFTER FACE WHICH ONE WAS HERS WHAT IRONY SHE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS LIFE TO KNOW FOR WHOM INDEED HE RISKED HIS LIFE EVERY HOUR OF THE TWENTY FOUR
2416-152137-0011 WAS CLOSE TO HIM NOW WITHIN REACH AND AS FAR REMOVED AS THOUGH A THOUSAND MILES SEPARATED THEM SHE WAS THERE BUT HE COULD NOT RECOGNISE A FACE THAT HE HAD NEVER SEEN
2416-152137-0012 WITH AN EFFORT HE CHOKED BACK THE BITTER IMPOTENT LAUGH THAT ROSE TO HIS LIPS THEY WERE TALKING LAUGHING AROUND HIM HER VOICE YES
2416-152137-0013 HE HAD ONCE HEARD THAT AND THAT HE WOULD RECOGNISE AGAIN HE STRAINED TO CATCH TO INDIVIDUALISE THE TONE SOUNDS THAT FLOATED IN A MEDLEY ABOUT HIM IT WAS USELESS OF COURSE
2416-152137-0014 EVERY EFFORT THAT HE HAD EVER MADE TO FIND HER HAD BEEN USELESS SHE WAS TOO CLEVER FAR TOO CLEVER FOR THAT SHE TOO WOULD KNOW THAT HE COULD AND WOULD RECOGNISE HER VOICE WHERE HE COULD RECOGNISE NOTHING ELSE
2416-152137-0015 AND THEN SUDDENLY HE REALISED THAT HE WAS ATTRACTING ATTENTION LEVEL STARES FROM THE WOMEN RETURNED HIS GAZE
2416-152137-0016 OTHERS IN THE SAME ROW OF SEATS AS HIS OWN WERE IMPATIENTLY WAITING TO GET BY HIM WITH A MUTTERED APOLOGY JIMMIE DALE RAISED THE SEAT OF HIS CHAIR ALLOWING THESE LATTER TO PASS HIM AND THEN
2416-152137-0017 SLIPPING THE LETTER INTO HIS POCKETBOOK HE SNATCHED UP HIS HAT FROM THE SEAT RACK THERE WAS STILL A CHANCE KNOWING HE WAS THERE SHE WOULD BE ON HER GUARD BUT IN THE LOBBY AMONG THE CROWD AND UNAWARE OF HIS PRESENCE
2416-152137-0018 THERE WAS THE POSSIBILITY THAT IF HE COULD REACH THE ENTRANCE AHEAD OF HER SHE TOO MIGHT BE TALKING AND LAUGHING AS SHE LEFT THE THEATRE JUST A SINGLE WORD JUST A TONE THAT WAS ALL HE ASKED
2416-152137-0019 TIGHT PACKED THE MASS OF PEOPLE JOSTLED ELBOWED AND PUSHED GOOD NATUREDLY IT WAS A VOICE NOW HER VOICE THAT HE WAS LISTENING FOR BUT THOUGH IT SEEMED THAT EVERY FACULTY WAS STRAINED AND INTENT UPON THAT ONE EFFORT
2416-152137-0020 HIS EYES TOO HAD IN NO DEGREE RELAXED THEIR VIGILANCE AND ONCE HALF GRIMLY HALF SARDONICALLY HE SMILED TO HIMSELF
2416-152137-0021 WITH THEIR PROSPEROUS WELL GROOMED ESCORTS THERE WAS THE WOWZER OVER THERE SLEEK DAPPER SQUIRMING IN AND OUT OF THE THRONG WITH THE AGILITY AND STEALTH OF A CAT AS LARRY THE BAT HE HAD MET THE WOWZER MANY TIMES
2416-152137-0022 AS INDEED HE HAD MET AND WAS ACQUAINTED WITH MOST OF THE ELITE OF THE UNDERWORLD THE WOWZER BEYOND A SHADOW OF DOUBT IN HIS OWN PROFESSION STOOD UPON A PLANE ENTIRELY BY HIMSELF AMONG THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK
2416-152137-0023 POKE GETTER IN THE UNITED STATES THE CROWD THINNED IN THE LOBBY THINNED DOWN TO THE LAST FEW BELATED STRAGGLERS WHO PASSED HIM AS HE STILL LOITERED IN THE ENTRANCE
2416-152137-0024 AND DISAPPOINTMENT THAT BURNED WITHIN HIM STEPPED OUT TO THE PAVEMENT AND HEADED DOWN BROADWAY AFTER ALL HE HAD KNOWN IT IN HIS HEART OF HEARTS ALL THE TIME IT HAD
2416-152137-0025 ALWAYS BEEN THE SAME IT WAS ONLY ONE MORE OCCASION ADDED TO THE INNUMERABLE ONES THAT HAD GONE BEFORE IN WHICH SHE HAD ELUDED HIM AND NOW THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0026 AUTOMATICALLY HE QUICKENED HIS STEPS A LITTLE IT WAS USELESS FUTILE PROFITLESS FOR THE MOMENT AT LEAST TO DISTURB HIMSELF OVER HIS FAILURE THERE WAS THE LETTER
2416-152137-0027 WHAT SUDDEN EMERGENCY WAS THE GRAY SEAL CALLED UPON TO FACE THIS TIME WHAT ROLE UNREHEARSED WITHOUT WARNING MUST HE PLAY WHAT STORY OF GRIM
2416-152137-0028 JIMMIE DALE A BLOCK DOWN HE TURNED FROM BROADWAY OUT OF THE THEATRE CROWDS THAT STREAMED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS PAST HIM THE LETTER
2416-152137-0029 ALMOST FEVERISHLY NOW HE WAS SEEKING AN OPPORTUNITY TO OPEN AND READ IT UNOBSERVED AN EAGERNESS UPON HIM THAT MINGLED EXHILARATION AT THE LURE OF DANGER WITH A SENSE OF PREMONITION THAT IRRITABLY
2416-152137-0030 INEVITABLY WAS WITH HIM AT MOMENTS SUCH AS THESE IT SEEMED IT ALWAYS SEEMED THAT WITH AN UNOPENED LETTER OF HERS IN HIS POSSESSION IT WAS AS THOUGH HE WERE ABOUT TO OPEN A PAGE IN THE BOOK OF FATE AND READ
2416-152137-0031 A PRONOUNCEMENT UPON HIMSELF THAT MIGHT MEAN LIFE OR DEATH HE HURRIED ON PEOPLE STILL PASSED BY HIM TOO MANY AND THEN A CAFE JUST AHEAD
2416-152137-0032 MAKING A CORNER GAVE HIM THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HE SOUGHT AWAY FROM THE ENTRANCE ON THE SIDE STREET THE BRILLIANT LIGHTS FROM THE WINDOWS SHONE OUT ON A COMPARATIVELY DESERTED PAVEMENT
2416-152137-0033 THERE WAS AMPLE LIGHT TO READ BY EVEN AS FAR AWAY FROM THE WINDOW AS THE CURB AND JIMMIE DALE WITH AN APPROVING NOD TURNED THE CORNER AND WALKED ALONG A FEW STEPS UNTIL OPPOSITE THE FARTHEST WINDOW BUT
2416-152137-0034 AS HE HALTED HERE AT THE EDGE OF THE STREET HE GLANCED QUICKLY BEHIND HIM AT A MAN WHOM HE HAD JUST PASSED THE OTHER HAD PAUSED AT THE CORNER AND WAS STARING DOWN THE STREET JIMMIE DALE INSTANTLY AND NONCHALANTLY PRODUCED HIS CIGARETTE CASE
2416-152137-0035 SELECTED A CIGARETTE AND FASTIDIOUSLY TAPPED ITS END ON HIS THUMB NAIL INSPECTOR BURTON IN PLAIN CLOTHES HE OBSERVED MUSINGLY TO HIMSELF I WONDER IF IT'S JUST A FLUKE

2416-152139-0000 HE SURVEYED THE HOUSE FROM THE SIDEWALK WATCHING WITH A SORT OF SPECULATIVE SATISFACTION A MAN'S SHADOW THAT PASSED CONSTANTLY TO AND FRO ACROSS THE DRAWN BLINDS OF ONE OF THE LOWER WINDOWS

2416-152139-0007 WAVED HIS HAND TAKE A CHAIR HE SAID OVER HIS SHOULDER AND THEN TURNING IN THE ACT OF DROPPING INTO HIS OWN CHAIR GRASPED SUDDENLY AT THE EDGE OF THE DESK INSTEAD
2416-152139-0008 AND WITH A LOW STARTLED CRY STARED ACROSS THE ROOM JIMMIE DALE WAS LEANING BACK AGAINST THE DOOR THAT WAS CLOSED NOW BEHIND HIM AND ON JIMMIE DALE'S FACE WAS A BLACK SILK MASK

2416-152139-0063 AND DROPPED IT BACK ON THE FLOOR AGAIN THERE WAS NO LABEL ON IT BUT IT NEEDED NONE THE STRONG PENETRATING ODOR OF BITTER ALMONDS WAS TELLTALE EVIDENCE ENOUGH IT WAS PRUSSIC
2416-152139-0064 OR HYDROCYANIC ACID PROBABLY THE MOST DEADLY POISON AND THE SWIFTEST IN ITS ACTION THAT WAS KNOWN TO SCIENCE CARLING HAD PROVIDED AGAINST THAT SOME DAY IN HIS CONFESSION FOR A LITTLE SPACE
2416-152139-0065 MOTIONLESS JIMMIE DALE STOOD LOOKING DOWN AT THE SILENT OUTSTRETCHED FORM THEN HE WALKED SLOWLY BACK TO THE DESK AND SLOWLY DELIBERATELY PICKED UP THE SIGNED CONFESSION AND THE STEAMSHIP TICKET HE HELD THEM AN INSTANT
2416-152139-0066 STARING AT THEM THEN METHODICALLY BEGAN TO TEAR THEM INTO LITTLE PIECES A STRANGE TIRED SMILE HOVERING ON HIS LIPS THE MAN WAS DEAD NOW THERE WOULD BE DISGRACE ENOUGH FOR SOME ONE TO BEAR A MOTHER PERHAPS

2436-2476-0007 IT WAS A LOW VAULTED METAL ROOM WITH BLUE AND YELLOW TUBE LIGHTS AT ITS SIDES THE OVAL WINDOWS SHOWED THE DECK WITH ITS PORTS ON THE DOME SIDE THROUGH WHICH A VISTA OF THE STARRY FIRMAMENT WAS VISIBLE WE WERE WELL ON OUR COURSE TO MARS
2436-2476-0008 THE MOON HAD DWINDLED TO A PIN POINT OF LIGHT BESIDE THE CRESCENT EARTH AND BEHIND THEM OUR SUN BLAZED VISUALLY THE LARGEST ORB IN THE HEAVENS IT WAS SOME SIXTY EIGHT MILLION MILES FROM THE EARTH TO MARS
2436-2476-0009 A FLIGHT ORDINARILY OF SOME TEN DAYS THERE WERE FIVE TABLES IN THE DINING SALON EACH WITH EIGHT SEATS SNAP AND I HAD ONE OF THE TABLES WE SAT AT THE ENDS WITH THE PASSENGERS ON EACH OF THE SIDES
2436-2476-0010 GREGG THIS IS SERO OB HAHN I MET THE KEEN SOMBER GAZE OF A VENUS MAN OF MIDDLE AGE A SMALL SLIM GRACEFUL MAN WITH SLEEK BLACK HAIR HIS POINTED FACE ACCENTUATED BY THE POINTED BEARD WAS PALLID
2436-2476-0011 UPON HIS BREAST WAS A HUGE PLATINUM ORNAMENT A DEVICE LIKE A STAR AND CROSS ENTWINED I AM HAPPY TO MEET YOU SIR HIS VOICE WAS SOFT AND DEEP OB HAHN I REPEATED
2436-2476-0012 I SHOULD HAVE HEARD OF YOU NO DOUBT BUT A SMILE PLUCKED AT HIS THIN GRAY LIPS

2436-2476-0017 THE TALL ENGLISHMAN IN HIS WHITE LINEN SUIT BOWED ACKNOWLEDGEMENT MY COMPLIMENTS MISTER HALJAN I HOPE YOU HAVE NO STRONG RELIGIOUS CONVICTIONS ELSE WE WILL MAKE YOUR TABLE HERE VERY MISERABLE
2436-2476-0018 THE THIRD PASSENGER HAD EVIDENTLY KEPT OUT OF THE ARGUMENT SNAP INTRODUCED HIM AS RANCE RANKIN AN AMERICAN A QUIET BLOND FELLOW OF THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY I ORDERED MY BREAKFAST AND LET THE ARGUMENT GO ON
2436-2476-0019 I DEAL IN TRICKS HOW TO FOOL AN AUDIENCE HIS KEEN AMUSED GAZE WAS ON OB HAHN THIS GENTLEMAN FROM VENUS AND I HAVE TOO MUCH IN COMMON TO ARGUE
2436-2476-0020 I LIKE TO EAT IN QUIET ARGUING PASSENGERS ALWAYS ANNOY ME THERE WERE STILL THREE SEATS VACANT AT OUR TABLE I WONDERED WHO WOULD OCCUPY THEM I SOON LEARNED THE ANSWER FOR ONE SEAT AT LEAST RANKIN SAID CALMLY
2436-2476-0021 HIS GLANCE WENT TO THE EMPTY SEAT AT MY RIGHT HAND THE VENZA ISN'T THAT HER NAME SHE AND I ARE DESTINED FOR THE SAME THEATER IN FERROK SHAHN SO VENZA WAS TO SIT BESIDE ME IT WAS GOOD NEWS
2436-2476-0022 TEN DAYS OF A RELIGIOUS ARGUMENT THREE TIMES A DAY WOULD BE INTOLERABLE BUT THE CHEERFUL VENZA WOULD HELP SHE NEVER EATS THE MIDDAY MEAL SAID SNAP SHE'S ON THE DECK HAVING ORANGE JUICE I GUESS IT'S THE OLD GAG ABOUT DIET EH
2436-2476-0023 AS A MAN WHO LOOKED HARDLY TWENTY FIVE HE WAS AT THIS MOMENT EVIDENTLY IN A GAY MOOD HIS CLEAN CUT HANDSOME PROFILE WITH ITS POETIC DARK CURLS

2436-2476-0025 I ANSWERED HER GREETING AND MET GEORGE PRINCE'S CASUAL GAZE HE TOO SMILED AS THOUGH TO SIGNIFY THAT HIS SISTER HAD TOLD HIM OF THE SERVICE I HAD DONE HER OR WAS HIS SMILE AN IRONICAL MEMORY OF HOW HE HAD ELUDED ME THIS MORNING WHEN I CHASED HIM
2436-2476-0026 I GAZED AFTER HIS SMALL WHITE SUITED FIGURE AS HE FOLLOWED ANITA FROM THE SALON AND THINKING OF HER I PRAYED THAT CARTER AND HALSEY MIGHT BE WRONG WHATEVER PLOTTING AGAINST THE GRANTLINE EXPEDITION MIGHT BE GOING ON
2436-2476-0027 MY ATTENTION WAS BROUGHT SUDDENLY BACK TO THE REALITY OF OUR TABLE I HEARD OB HAHN'S SILKY VOICE WE PASSED QUITE CLOSE TO THE MOON LAST NIGHT MISTER DEAN YES SAID SNAP WE DID DIDN'T WE ALWAYS DO

2436-2481-0024 THE SIZZLING WAS FAINTLY AUDIBLE MY DOOR SEAL WAS BREAKING UPON IMPULSE I REACHED FOR THE DOOR JERKED IT OPEN NO ONE THERE
2436-2481-0025 WAS EMPTY BUT I LEAPED AND STRUCK A SOLID BODY CROUCHING IN THE DOORWAY A GIANT MAN
2436-2481-0026 HIS ELECTRONIZED METALLIC ROBE BURNED MY HANDS I LUNGED AGAINST HIM I WAS ALMOST AS SURPRISED AS HE I SHOT BUT THE STAB OF HEAT EVIDENTLY MISSED HIM THE SHOCK OF MY ENCOUNTER SHORT CIRCUITED HIS ROBE HE MATERIALIZED IN THE STARLIGHT A BRIEF

2436-2481-0037 THE DOOR OF THE SHINING GARDEN WAS CLOSED A BRIEF GLIMPSE GIVEN TO ME AND TO HER OF WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND NOW
248-130644-0000 IT WOULD BE A LITTLE HARD TO BLAME THE RECTOR OF PENNICOTE THAT IN THE COURSE OF LOOKING AT THINGS FROM EVERY POINT OF VIEW HE LOOKED AT GWENDOLEN AS A GIRL LIKELY TO MAKE A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE
248-130644-0001 WHY SHOULD HE BE EXPECTED TO DIFFER FROM HIS CONTEMPORARIES IN THIS MATTER AND WISH HIS NIECE A WORSE END OF HER CHARMING MAIDENHOOD THAN THEY WOULD APPROVE AS THE BEST POSSIBLE
248-130644-0002 IT IS RATHER TO BE SET DOWN TO HIS CREDIT THAT HIS FEELINGS ON THE SUBJECT WERE ENTIRELY GOOD NATURED AND IN CONSIDERING THE RELATION OF MEANS TO ENDS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MERE FOLLY TO HAVE BEEN GUIDED BY THE EXCEPTIONAL AND IDYLLIC
248-130644-0003 IN ORDER THAT A MARQUIS MIGHT FALL IN LOVE WITH HER OR TO HAVE INSISTED THAT SINCE A FAIR MAIDEN WAS TO BE SOUGHT SHE SHOULD KEEP HERSELF OUT OF THE WAY MISTER GASCOIGNE'S CALCULATIONS WERE OF THE KIND CALLED RATIONAL
248-130644-0004 AND HE DID NOT EVEN THINK OF GETTING A TOO FRISKY HORSE IN ORDER THAT GWENDOLEN MIGHT BE THREATENED WITH AN ACCIDENT AND BE RESCUED BY A MAN OF PROPERTY HE WISHED HIS NIECE WELL AND HE MEANT HER TO BE SEEN TO ADVANTAGE IN THE BEST SOCIETY OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD
248-130644-0005 HER UNCLE'S INTENTION FELL IN PERFECTLY WITH GWENDOLEN'S OWN WISHES BUT LET NO ONE SUPPOSE THAT SHE ALSO CONTEMPLATED A BRILLIANT MARRIAGE AS THE DIRECT END OF HER WITCHING THE WORLD WITH HER GRACE ON HORSEBACK OR WITH ANY OTHER ACCOMPLISHMENT
248-130644-0006 THAT SHE WAS TO BE MARRIED SOME TIME OR OTHER SHE WOULD HAVE FELT OBLIGED TO ADMIT AND THAT HER MARRIAGE WOULD NOT BE OF A MIDDLING KIND SUCH AS MOST GIRLS WERE CONTENTED WITH SHE FELT QUIETLY UNARGUMENTATIVELY SURE
248-130644-0007 BUT HER THOUGHTS NEVER DWELT ON MARRIAGE AS THE FULFILLMENT OF HER AMBITION THE DRAMAS IN WHICH SHE IMAGINED HERSELF A HEROINE WERE NOT WROUGHT UP TO THAT CLOSE TO BE VERY MUCH SUED OR HOPELESSLY SIGHED FOR AS A BRIDE WAS INDEED
248-130644-0008 AN INDISPENSABLE AND AGREEABLE GUARANTEE OF WOMANLY POWER BUT TO BECOME A WIFE AND WEAR ALL THE DOMESTIC FETTERS OF THAT CONDITION WAS ON THE WHOLE A VEXATIOUS NECESSITY HER OBSERVATION OF MATRIMONY HAD INCLINED HER TO THINK IT RATHER A DREARY STATE
248-130644-0009 IN WHICH A WOMAN COULD NOT DO WHAT SHE LIKED HAD MORE CHILDREN THAN WERE DESIRABLE WAS CONSEQUENTLY DULL AND BECAME IRREVOCABLY IMMERSED IN HUMDRUM OF COURSE MARRIAGE WAS SOCIAL PROMOTION
248-130644-0010 SHE COULD NOT LOOK FORWARD TO A SINGLE LIFE BUT PROMOTIONS HAVE SOMETIMES TO BE TAKEN WITH BITTER HERBS A PEERAGE WILL NOT QUITE DO INSTEAD OF LEADERSHIP TO THE MAN WHO MEANT TO LEAD AND THIS DELICATE LIMBED SYLPH OF TWENTY MEANT TO LEAD
248-130644-0011 FOR SUCH PASSIONS DWELL IN FEMININE BREASTS ALSO IN GWENDOLEN'S HOWEVER THEY DWELT AMONG STRICTLY FEMININE FURNITURE AND HAD NO DISTURBING REFERENCE TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF LEARNING OR THE BALANCE OF THE CONSTITUTION
248-130644-0012 HER KNOWLEDGE BEING SUCH AS WITH NO SORT OF STANDING ROOM OR LENGTH OF LEVER COULD HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO MOVE THE WORLD SHE MEANT TO DO WHAT WAS PLEASANT TO HERSELF IN A STRIKING MANNER
248-130644-0013 AND TO HAVE THEIR LIVES BLOWN HITHER AND THITHER LIKE EMPTY SHIPS IN WHICH NO WILL WAS PRESENT IT WAS NOT TO BE SO WITH HER SHE WOULD NO LONGER BE SACRIFICED TO CREATURES WORTH LESS THAN HERSELF
248-130644-0014 BUT WOULD MAKE THE VERY BEST OF THE CHANCES THAT LIFE OFFERED HER AND CONQUER CIRCUMSTANCES BY HER EXCEPTIONAL CLEVERNESS
248-130644-0015 THE ARCHERY CLUB AND INVITATIONS TO DINE WITH THE ARROWPOINTS AS THE HIGHEST LIGHTS IN HER SCENERY WAS NOT A POSITION THAT SEEMED TO OFFER REMARKABLE CHANCES BUT GWENDOLEN'S CONFIDENCE LAY CHIEFLY IN HERSELF
248-130644-0016 SHE FELT WELL EQUIPPED FOR THE MASTERY OF LIFE WITH REGARD TO MUCH IN HER LOT HITHERTO SHE HELD HERSELF RATHER HARDLY DEALT WITH BUT AS TO HER EDUCATION SHE WOULD HAVE ADMITTED THAT IT HAD LEFT HER UNDER NO DISADVANTAGES
248-130644-0017 IN THE SCHOOL ROOM HER QUICK MIND HAD TAKEN READILY THAT STRONG STARCH OF UNEXPLAINED RULES AND DISCONNECTED FACTS WHICH SAVES IGNORANCE FROM ANY PAINFUL SENSE OF LIMPNESS
248-130644-0018 AND WHAT REMAINED OF ALL THINGS KNOWABLE SHE WAS CONSCIOUS OF BEING SUFFICIENTLY ACQUAINTED WITH THROUGH NOVELS PLAYS AND POEMS ABOUT HER FRENCH AND MUSIC THE TWO JUSTIFYING ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF A YOUNG LADY SHE FELT NO GROUND FOR UNEASINESS
248-130644-0019 AND WHEN TO ALL THESE QUALIFICATIONS NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE WE ADD THE SPONTANEOUS SENSE OF CAPABILITY SOME HAPPY PERSONS ARE BORN WITH SO THAT ANY SUBJECT THEY TURN THEIR ATTENTION TO IMPRESSES THEM WITH THEIR OWN POWER OF FORMING A CORRECT JUDGMENT ON IT
248-130644-0020 WHO CAN WONDER IF GWENDOLEN FELT READY TO MANAGE HER OWN DESTINY THERE WERE MANY SUBJECTS IN THE WORLD PERHAPS THE MAJORITY IN WHICH SHE FELT NO INTEREST BECAUSE THEY WERE STUPID
248-130644-0021 FOR SUBJECTS ARE APT TO APPEAR STUPID TO THE YOUNG AS LIGHT SEEMS DULL TO THE OLD BUT SHE WOULD NOT HAVE FELT AT ALL HELPLESS IN RELATION TO THEM IF THEY HAD TURNED UP IN CONVERSATION IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT NO ONE HAD DISPUTED HER POWER OR HER GENERAL SUPERIORITY
248-130644-0022 WHAT WILL GWENDOLEN THINK IF THE FOOTMAN TROD HEAVILY IN CREAKING BOOTS OR IF THE LAUNDRESS'S WORK WAS UNSATISFACTORY THE MAID SAID THIS WILL NEVER DO FOR MISS HARLETH
248-130644-0023 IF THE WOOD SMOKED IN THE BEDROOM FIREPLACE MISSUS DAVILOW WHOSE OWN WEAK EYES SUFFERED MUCH FROM THIS INCONVENIENCE SPOKE APOLOGETICALLY OF IT TO GWENDOLEN
248-130644-0024 IF WHEN THEY WERE UNDER THE STRESS OF TRAVELING SHE DID NOT APPEAR AT THE BREAKFAST TABLE TILL EVERY ONE ELSE HAD FINISHED THE ONLY QUESTION WAS HOW GWENDOLEN'S COFFEE AND TOAST SHOULD STILL BE OF THE HOTTEST AND CRISPEST
248-130644-0025 IT WAS ALWAYS SHE HERSELF WHO HAD TO BE TOLERANT TO BEG THAT ALICE WHO SAT WAITING ON HER WOULD NOT STICK UP HER SHOULDERS IN THAT FRIGHTFUL MANNER AND THAT ISABEL INSTEAD OF PUSHING UP TO HER AND ASKING QUESTIONS WOULD GO AWAY TO MISS MERRY
248-130644-0026 ALWAYS SHE WAS THE PRINCESS IN EXILE WHO IN TIME OF FAMINE WAS TO HAVE HER BREAKFAST ROLL MADE OF THE FINEST BOLTED FLOUR FROM THE SEVEN THIN EARS OF WHEAT AND IN A GENERAL DECAMPMENT WAS TO HAVE HER SILVER FORK KEPT OUT OF THE BAGGAGE
248-130644-0027 HOW WAS THIS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR THE ANSWER MAY SEEM TO LIE QUITE ON THE SURFACE IN HER BEAUTY A CERTAIN UNUSUALNESS ABOUT HER
248-130644-0028 A DECISION OF WILL WHICH MADE ITSELF FELT IN HER GRACEFUL MOVEMENTS AND CLEAR UNHESITATING TONES SO THAT IF SHE CAME INTO THE ROOM ON A RAINY DAY WHEN EVERYBODY ELSE WAS FLACCID AND THE USE OF THINGS IN GENERAL WAS NOT APPARENT TO THEM
248-130644-0029 THERE SEEMED TO BE A SUDDEN SUFFICIENT REASON FOR KEEPING UP THE FORMS OF LIFE AND EVEN THE WAITERS AT HOTELS SHOWED THE MORE ALACRITY IN DOING AWAY WITH CRUMBS AND CREASES AND DREGS WITH STRUGGLING FLIES IN THEM
248-130644-0030 THIS POTENT CHARM ADDED TO THE FACT THAT SHE WAS THE ELDEST DAUGHTER TOWARD WHOM HER MAMMA HAD ALWAYS BEEN IN AN APOLOGETIC STATE OF MIND FOR THE EVILS BROUGHT ON HER BY A STEP FATHER MAY SEEM SO FULL A REASON FOR GWENDOLEN'S DOMESTIC EMPIRE
248-130644-0031 THAT TO LOOK FOR ANY OTHER WOULD BE TO ASK THE REASON OF DAYLIGHT WHEN THE SUN IS SHINING BUT BEWARE OF ARRIVING AT CONCLUSIONS WITHOUT COMPARISON
248-130644-0032 WHOSE FIRMNESS SHOWED ITSELF IN NO VERY GRACEFUL OR EUPHONIOUS WAY AND WHO WERE NOT ELDEST DAUGHTERS WITH A TENDER TIMID MOTHER COMPUNCTIOUS AT HAVING SUBJECTED THEM TO INCONVENIENCES
248-130644-0033 SOME OF THEM WERE A VERY COMMON SORT OF MEN AND THE ONLY POINT OF RESEMBLANCE AMONG THEM ALL WAS A STRONG DETERMINATION TO HAVE WHAT WAS PLEASANT WITH A TOTAL FEARLESSNESS IN MAKING THEMSELVES DISAGREEABLE OR DANGEROUS WHEN THEY DID NOT GET IT
248-130644-0034 THE FEAR AND THE FONDNESS BEING PERHAPS BOTH HEIGHTENED BY WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE IRIDESCENCE OF HER CHARACTER THE PLAY OF VARIOUS NAY CONTRARY TENDENCIES
248-130644-0035 FOR MACBETH'S RHETORIC ABOUT THE IMPOSSIBILITY OF BEING MANY OPPOSITE THINGS IN THE SAME MOMENT REFERRED TO THE CLUMSY NECESSITIES OF ACTION AND NOT TO THE SUBTLER POSSIBILITIES OF FEELING WE CANNOT SPEAK A LOYAL WORD AND BE MEANLY SILENT
248-130644-0036 WE CANNOT KILL AND NOT KILL IN THE SAME MOMENT
248-130652-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE O GENTLEMEN THE TIME OF LIFE IS SHORT TO SPEND THAT SHORTNESS BASELY WERE TOO LONG IF LIFE DID RIDE UPON A DIAL'S POINT STILL ENDING AT THE ARRIVAL OF AN HOUR SHAKESPEARE
248-130652-0001 ON THE SECOND DAY AFTER THE ARCHERY MEETING MISTER HENLEIGH MALLINGER GRANDCOURT WAS AT HIS BREAKFAST TABLE WITH MISTER LUSH EVERYTHING AROUND THEM WAS AGREEABLE
248-130652-0002 THE STILL LIFE IN THE ROOM WHICH SEEMED THE STILLER FOR ITS SOBER ANTIQUATED ELEGANCE AS IF IT KEPT A CONSCIOUS WELL BRED SILENCE UNLIKE THE RESTLESSNESS OF VULGAR FURNITURE WHETHER THE GENTLEMEN WERE AGREEABLE TO EACH OTHER WAS LESS EVIDENT
248-130652-0003 MISTER GRANDCOURT HAD DRAWN HIS CHAIR ASIDE SO AS TO FACE THE LAWN AND WITH HIS LEFT LEG OVER ANOTHER CHAIR AND HIS RIGHT ELBOW ON THE TABLE WAS SMOKING A LARGE CIGAR WHILE HIS COMPANION WAS STILL EATING THE DOGS
248-130652-0004 GAVE A VACILLATING PREFERENCE FIRST TO ONE GENTLEMAN THEN TO THE OTHER BEING DOGS IN SUCH GOOD CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY COULD PLAY AT HUNGER AND LIKED TO BE SERVED WITH DELICACIES WHICH THEY DECLINED TO PUT IN THEIR MOUTHS ALL EXCEPT FETCH
248-130652-0005 THE BEAUTIFUL LIVER COLORED WATER SPANIEL WHICH SAT WITH ITS FOREPAWS FIRMLY PLANTED AND ITS EXPRESSIVE BROWN FACE TURNED UPWARD WATCHING GRANDCOURT WITH UNSHAKEN CONSTANCY
248-130652-0006 HE HELD IN HIS LAP A TINY MALTESE DOG WITH A TINY SILVER COLLAR AND BELL AND WHEN HE HAD A HAND UNUSED BY CIGAR OR COFFEE CUP IT RESTED ON THIS SMALL PARCEL OF ANIMAL WARMTH
248-130652-0007 GRANDCOURT LOOKED AT HER WITH UNCHANGED FACE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN TOOK THE TROUBLE TO LAY DOWN HIS CIGAR WHILE HE LIFTED THE UNIMPASSIONED FLUFF CLOSE TO HIS CHIN AND GAVE IT CARESSING PATS ALL THE WHILE GRAVELY WATCHING FETCH
248-130652-0008 WHO POOR THING WHIMPERED INTERRUPTEDLY AS IF TRYING TO REPRESS THAT SIGN OF DISCONTENT AND AT LAST RESTED HER HEAD BESIDE THE APPEALING PAW LOOKING UP WITH PITEOUS BESEECHING SO AT LEAST A LOVER OF DOGS MUST HAVE INTERPRETED FETCH
248-130652-0009 AND GRANDCOURT KEPT SO MANY DOGS THAT HE WAS REPUTED TO LOVE THEM AT ANY RATE HIS IMPULSE TO ACT JUST IN THAT WAY STARTED FROM SUCH AN INTERPRETATION BUT WHEN THE AMUSING ANGUISH BURST FORTH IN A HOWLING BARK
248-130652-0010 THAT THE BRUTE OF A CIGAR REQUIRED RELIGHTING FETCH HAVING BEGUN TO WAIL FOUND LIKE OTHERS OF HER SEX THAT IT WAS NOT EASY TO LEAVE OFF INDEED THE SECOND HOWL WAS A LOUDER ONE AND THE THIRD WAS LIKE UNTO IT
248-130652-0011 TURN OUT THAT BRUTE WILL YOU SAID GRANDCOURT TO LUSH WITHOUT RAISING HIS VOICE OR LOOKING AT HIM AS IF HE COUNTED ON ATTENTION TO THE SMALLEST SIGN AND LUSH IMMEDIATELY ROSE LIFTED FETCH THOUGH SHE WAS RATHER HEAVY
248-130652-0012 SHALL YOU RIDE OR DRIVE TO QUETCHAM TO DAY I AM NOT GOING TO QUETCHAM YOU DID NOT GO YESTERDAY GRANDCOURT SMOKED IN SILENCE FOR HALF A MINUTE AND THEN SAID
248-130652-0013 I SUPPOSE YOU SENT MY CARD AND INQUIRIES I WENT MYSELF AT FOUR AND SAID YOU WERE SURE TO BE THERE SHORTLY THEY WOULD SUPPOSE SOME ACCIDENT PREVENTED YOU FROM FULFILLING THE INTENTION ESPECIALLY IF YOU GO TO DAY
248-130652-0014 SILENCE FOR A COUPLE OF MINUTES THEN GRANDCOURT SAID WHAT MEN ARE INVITED HERE WITH THEIR WIVES
248-130652-0015 THEN THERE ARE MISTER HOLLIS AND LADY FLORA AND THE CUSHATS AND THE GOGOFFS RATHER A RAGGED LOT REMARKED GRANDCOURT AFTER A WHILE WHY DID YOU ASK THE GOGOFFS
248-130652-0016 GRANDCOURT LIKE MANY OTHERS HAD TWO REMARKABLY DIFFERENT VOICES HITHERTO WE HAVE HEARD HIM SPEAKING IN A SUPERFICIAL INTERRUPTED DRAWL SUGGESTIVE CHIEFLY OF LANGUOR
248-130652-0017 AND ONE OF YOUR DAMNED MUSICIANS BUT NOT A COMIC FELLOW I WONDER IF KLESMER WOULD CONSENT TO COME TO US WHEN HE LEAVES QUETCHAM NOTHING BUT FIRST CLASS MUSIC WILL GO DOWN WITH MISS ARROWPOINT
248-130652-0018 LUSH SPOKE CARELESSLY BUT HE WAS REALLY SEIZING AN OPPORTUNITY AND FIXING AN OBSERVANT LOOK ON GRANDCOURT WHO NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME TURNED HIS EYES TOWARD HIS COMPANION BUT SLOWLY AND WITHOUT SPEAKING UNTIL HE HAD GIVEN TWO LONG LUXURIANT PUFFS
248-130652-0019 WHEN HE SAID PERHAPS IN A LOWER TONE THAN EVER BUT WITH A PERCEPTIBLE EDGE OF CONTEMPT WHAT IN THE NAME OF NONSENSE HAVE I TO DO WITH MISS ARROWPOINT AND HER MUSIC
248-130652-0020 YOU NEED NOT GIVE YOURSELF MUCH TROUBLE PERHAPS BUT SOME FORMS MUST BE GONE THROUGH BEFORE A MAN CAN MARRY A MILLION VERY LIKELY BUT I AM NOT GOING TO MARRY A MILLION
248-130652-0021 THAT'S A PITY TO FLING AWAY AN OPPORTUNITY OF THIS SORT AND KNOCK DOWN YOUR OWN PLANS YOUR PLANS I SUPPOSE YOU MEAN YOU HAVE SOME DEBTS YOU KNOW AND THINGS MAY TURN OUT INCONVENIENTLY AFTER ALL
248-130652-0022 AND THE DAUGHTER'S LOOKS AND MANNERS REQUIRE NO ALLOWANCES ANY MORE THAN IF SHE HADN'T A SIXPENCE SHE IS NOT BEAUTIFUL BUT EQUAL TO CARRYING ANY RANK AND SHE IS NOT LIKELY TO REFUSE SUCH PROSPECTS AS YOU CAN OFFER HER
248-130652-0023 PERHAPS NOT THE FATHER AND MOTHER WOULD LET YOU DO ANYTHING YOU LIKE WITH THEM BUT I SHOULD NOT LIKE TO DO ANYTHING WITH THEM HERE IT WAS LUSH WHO MADE A LITTLE PAUSE BEFORE SPEAKING AGAIN
248-130652-0024 AND THEN HE SAID IN A DEEP VOICE OF REMONSTRANCE GOOD GOD GRANDCOURT AFTER YOUR EXPERIENCE WILL YOU LET A WHIM INTERFERE WITH YOUR COMFORTABLE SETTLEMENT IN LIFE SPARE YOUR ORATORY I KNOW WHAT I AM GOING TO DO
248-130652-0025 WHAT LUSH PUT DOWN HIS CIGAR AND THRUST HIS HANDS INTO HIS SIDE POCKETS AS IF HE HAD TO FACE SOMETHING EXASPERATING BUT MEANT TO KEEP HIS TEMPER I AM GOING TO MARRY THE OTHER GIRL
248-130652-0026 HAVE YOU FALLEN IN LOVE THIS QUESTION CARRIED A STRONG SNEER I AM GOING TO MARRY HER YOU HAVE MADE HER AN OFFER ALREADY THEN NO SHE IS A YOUNG LADY WITH A WILL OF HER OWN I FANCY
248-130652-0027 EXTREMELY WELL FITTED TO MAKE A RUMPUS SHE WOULD KNOW WHAT SHE LIKED SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU SAID GRANDCOURT WITH THE GHOST OF A SMILE PERFECTLY TRUE SAID LUSH ADDING AGAIN IN A MARKEDLY SNEERING TONE
248-130652-0028 HOWEVER IF YOU AND SHE ARE DEVOTED TO EACH OTHER THAT WILL BE ENOUGH GRANDCOURT TOOK NO NOTICE OF THIS SPEECH BUT SIPPED HIS COFFEE ROSE AND STROLLED OUT ON THE LAWN ALL THE DOGS FOLLOWING HIM
248-130652-0029 LUSH GLANCED AFTER HIM A MOMENT THEN RESUMED HIS CIGAR AND LIT IT BUT SMOKED SLOWLY CONSULTING HIS BEARD WITH INSPECTING EYES AND FINGERS TILL HE FINALLY STROKED IT WITH AN AIR OF HAVING ARRIVED AT SOME CONCLUSION AND SAID IN A SUBDUED VOICE
248-130652-0030 CHECK OLD BOY LUSH BEING A MAN OF SOME ABILITY HAD NOT KNOWN GRANDCOURT FOR FIFTEEN YEARS WITHOUT LEARNING WHAT SORT OF MEASURES WERE USELESS WITH HIM THOUGH WHAT SORT MIGHT BE USEFUL REMAINED OFTEN DUBIOUS
248-130652-0031 IN THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAREER HE HELD A FELLOWSHIP AND WAS NEAR TAKING ORDERS FOR THE SAKE OF A COLLEGE LIVING BUT NOT BEING FOND OF THAT PROSPECT ACCEPTED INSTEAD THE OFFICE OF TRAVELING COMPANION TO A MARQUESS AND AFTERWARD TO YOUNG GRANDCOURT
248-130652-0032 WHO HAD LOST HIS FATHER EARLY AND WHO FOUND LUSH SO CONVENIENT THAT HE HAD ALLOWED HIM TO BECOME PRIME MINISTER IN ALL HIS MORE PERSONAL AFFAIRS THE HABIT OF FIFTEEN YEARS HAD MADE GRANDCOURT MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF LUSH'S HANDINESS
248-130652-0033 AND LUSH MORE AND MORE IN NEED OF THE LAZY LUXURY TO WHICH HIS TRANSACTIONS ON BEHALF OF GRANDCOURT MADE NO INTERRUPTION WORTH RECKONING I CANNOT SAY THAT THE SAME LENGTHENED HABIT HAD INTENSIFIED GRANDCOURT'S WANT OF RESPECT FOR HIS COMPANION
248-130652-0034 SINCE THAT WANT HAD BEEN ABSOLUTE FROM THE BEGINNING BUT IT HAD CONFIRMED HIS SENSE THAT HE MIGHT KICK LUSH IF HE CHOSE ONLY HE NEVER DID CHOOSE TO KICK ANY ANIMAL BECAUSE THE ACT OF KICKING IS A COMPROMISING ATTITUDE
248-130652-0035 AND A GENTLEMAN'S DOGS SHOULD BE KICKED FOR HIM HE ONLY SAID THINGS WHICH MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED HIMSELF TO BE KICKED IF HIS CONFIDANT HAD BEEN A MAN OF INDEPENDENT SPIRIT
248-130652-0036 BUT WHAT SON OF A VICAR WHO HAS STINTED HIS WIFE AND DAUGHTERS OF CALICO IN ORDER TO SEND HIS MALE OFFSPRING TO OXFORD CAN KEEP AN INDEPENDENT SPIRIT WHEN HE IS BENT ON DINING WITH HIGH DISCRIMINATION RIDING GOOD HORSES
248-130652-0037 LIVING GENERALLY IN THE MOST LUXURIANT HONEY BLOSSOMED CLOVER AND ALL WITHOUT WORKING MISTER LUSH HAD PASSED FOR A SCHOLAR ONCE AND HAD STILL A SENSE OF SCHOLARSHIP WHEN HE WAS NOT TRYING TO REMEMBER MUCH OF IT
248-130652-0038 SINCE IN HIS OWN OPINION HE HAD NEVER DONE A BAD ACTION IT DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY TO CONSIDER WHETHER HE SHOULD BE LIKELY TO COMMIT ONE IF HIS LOVE OF EASE REQUIRED IT LUSH'S LOVE OF EASE WAS WELL SATISFIED AT PRESENT
248-130652-0039 AND IF HIS PUDDINGS WERE ROLLED TOWARD HIM IN THE DUST HE TOOK THE INSIDE BITS AND FOUND THEM RELISHING
248-130697-0000 ALL THINGS ARE CHANGES NOT INTO NOTHING BUT INTO THAT WHICH IS NOT AT PRESENT MARCUS AURELIUS
248-130697-0001 DEEDS ARE THE PULSE OF TIME HIS BEATING LIFE AND RIGHTEOUS OR UNRIGHTEOUS BEING DONE MUST THROB IN AFTER THROBS TILL TIME ITSELF BE LAID IN DARKNESS
248-130697-0002 AND THE UNIVERSE QUIVER AND BREATHE UPON NO MIRROR MORE IN THE EVENING SHE SENT FOR HIM AGAIN IT WAS ALREADY NEAR THE HOUR AT WHICH SHE HAD BEEN BROUGHT IN FROM THE SEA THE EVENING BEFORE
248-130697-0003 AND THE LIGHT WAS SUBDUED ENOUGH WITH BLINDS DRAWN UP AND WINDOWS OPEN SHE WAS SEATED GAZING FIXEDLY ON THE SEA RESTING HER CHEEK ON HER HAND LOOKING LESS SHATTERED THAN WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER BUT WITH A DEEP MELANCHOLY IN HER EXPRESSION
248-130697-0004 WHICH AS DERONDA APPROACHED HER PASSED INTO AN ANXIOUS TIMIDITY SHE DID NOT PUT OUT HER HAND BUT SAID HOW LONG AGO IT IS THEN WILL YOU SIT NEAR ME AGAIN A LITTLE WHILE
248-130697-0005 AND AGAIN TURNED WITH THE SAME EXPRESSION WHICH YET DID NOT ISSUE IN SPEECH THERE WAS SOME FEAR HINDERING HER AND DERONDA WISHING TO RELIEVE HER TIMIDITY AVERTED HIS FACE
248-130697-0006 PRESENTLY HE HEARD HER CRY IMPLORINGLY YOU WILL NOT SAY THAT ANY ONE ELSE SHOULD KNOW MOST DECIDEDLY NOT SAID DERONDA THERE IS NO ACTION THAT OUGHT TO BE TAKEN IN CONSEQUENCE
248-130697-0007 BUT IF I HAD NOT HAD THAT MURDEROUS WILL THAT MOMENT IF I HAD THROWN THE ROPE ON THE INSTANT PERHAPS IT WOULD HAVE HINDERED DEATH NO I THINK NOT SAID DERONDA SLOWLY
248-130697-0008 IF IT WERE TRUE THAT HE COULD SWIM HE MUST HAVE BEEN SEIZED WITH CRAMP WITH YOUR QUICKEST UTMOST EFFORT IT SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING TO SAVE HIM
248-130697-0009 THAT MOMENTARY MURDEROUS WILL CANNOT I THINK HAVE ALTERED THE COURSE OF EVENTS ITS EFFECT IS CONFINED TO THE MOTIVES IN YOUR OWN BREAST WITHIN OURSELVES OUR EVIL WILL IS MOMENTOUS
248-130697-0010 AND SOONER OR LATER IT WORKS ITS WAY OUTSIDE US IT MAY BE IN THE VITIATION THAT BREEDS EVIL ACTS BUT ALSO IT MAY BE IN THE SELF ABHORRENCE THAT STINGS US INTO BETTER STRIVING I AM SAVED FROM ROBBING OTHERS
248-130697-0011 SHE SPOKE HESITATINGLY I HAD NOT THOUGHT OF THEM SAID DERONDA I WAS THINKING TOO MUCH OF THE OTHER THINGS PERHAPS YOU DON'T QUITE KNOW THE BEGINNING OF IT ALL SAID GWENDOLEN SLOWLY AS IF SHE WERE OVERCOMING HER RELUCTANCE
248-130697-0012 THERE WAS SOME ONE ELSE HE OUGHT TO HAVE MARRIED AND I KNEW IT AND I TOLD HER I WOULD NOT HINDER IT AND I WENT AWAY THAT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST SAW ME
248-130697-0013 BUT THEN WE BECAME POOR ALL AT ONCE AND I WAS VERY MISERABLE AND I WAS TEMPTED I THOUGHT I SHALL DO AS I LIKE AND MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT I PERSUADED MYSELF AND IT WAS ALL DIFFERENT IT WAS ALL DREADFUL
248-130697-0014 THEN CAME HATRED AND WICKED THOUGHTS THAT WAS HOW IT ALL CAME I TOLD YOU I WAS AFRAID OF MYSELF
248-130697-0015 IF YOU DID NOT KNOW HOW MISERABLE I WAS YOU MIGHT BUT NOW IT HAS ALL BEEN NO USE I CAN CARE FOR NOTHING BUT SAVING THE REST FROM KNOWING POOR MAMMA
248-130697-0016 WORTH ANYTHING WORTHY ENOUGH I SHALL ALWAYS BE TOO WICKED TO THE VOICE BROKE OFF HELPLESS DERONDA'S HEART WAS PIERCED HE TURNED HIS EYES ON HER POOR BESEECHING FACE AND SAID
248-130697-0017 I BELIEVE THAT YOU MAY BECOME WORTHIER THAN YOU HAVE EVER YET BEEN WORTHY TO LEAD A LIFE THAT MAY BE A BLESSING NO EVIL DOOMS US HOPELESSLY EXCEPT THE EVIL WE LOVE AND DESIRE TO CONTINUE IN
248-130697-0018 AND MAKE NO EFFORT TO ESCAPE FROM YOU HAVE MADE EFFORTS YOU WILL GO ON MAKING THEM BUT YOU WERE THE BEGINNING OF THEM YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME SAID GWENDOLEN LEANING WITH HER CLASPED HANDS ON THE ARM OF HER CHAIR AND LOOKING AT HIM
248-130697-0019 WHILE HER FACE BORE PITEOUS TRACES OF THE LIFE EXPERIENCE CONCENTRATED IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS THAT NEW TERRIBLE LIFE LYING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE DEED WHICH FULFILLS A CRIMINAL DESIRE I WILL BEAR ANY PENANCE
248-130697-0020 I WILL LEAD ANY LIFE YOU TELL ME BUT YOU MUST NOT FORSAKE ME YOU MUST BE NEAR IF YOU HAD BEEN NEAR ME IF I COULD HAVE SAID EVERYTHING TO YOU I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT YOU WILL NOT FORSAKE ME
248-130697-0021 IT COULD NEVER BE MY IMPULSE TO FORSAKE YOU SAID DERONDA PROMPTLY WITH THAT VOICE WHICH LIKE HIS EYES HAD THE UNINTENTIONAL EFFECT OF MAKING HIS READY SYMPATHY SEEM MORE PERSONAL AND SPECIAL THAN IT REALLY WAS
248-130697-0022 AND IN THAT MOMENT HE WAS NOT HIMSELF QUITE FREE FROM A FOREBODING OF SOME SUCH SELF COMMITTING EFFECT HIS STRONG FEELING FOR THIS STRICKEN CREATURE COULD NOT HINDER RUSHING IMAGES OF FUTURE DIFFICULTY
248-130697-0023 TO AN INDEFINITE HOPE ANXIETIES BOTH IMMEDIATE AND DISTANT CROWDED ON HIS THOUGHT AND IT WAS UNDER THEIR INFLUENCE THAT AFTER A MOMENT'S SILENCE HE SAID
248-130697-0024 AND I AM NOT WITHOUT HOPE THAT MISSUS DAVILOW MAY SHORTLY FOLLOW HIM HER PRESENCE WILL BE THE GREATEST COMFORT TO YOU IT WILL GIVE YOU A MOTIVE TO SAVE HER FROM UNNECESSARY PAIN YES YES I WILL TRY AND YOU WILL NOT GO AWAY
248-130697-0025 NOT TILL AFTER SIR HUGO HAS COME BUT WE SHALL ALL GO TO ENGLAND AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SAID DERONDA NOT WISHING TO ENTER INTO PARTICULARS
248-130697-0026 GWENDOLEN LOOKED TOWARD THE WINDOW AGAIN WITH AN EXPRESSION WHICH SEEMED LIKE A GRADUAL AWAKENING TO NEW THOUGHTS THE TWILIGHT WAS PERCEPTIBLY DEEPENING
248-130697-0027 OR ELSE AT DIPLOW I AM QUITE UNCERTAIN WHERE I SHALL LIVE SAID DERONDA COLORING SHE WAS WARNED BY HIS CHANGED COLOR THAT SHE HAD SPOKEN TOO RASHLY AND FELL SILENT
248-130697-0028 WHEN YOU ARE AMONG YOUR FRIENDS AGAIN YOU WILL DISCERN NEW DUTIES SAID DERONDA MAKE IT A TASK NOW TO GET AS WELL AND CALM AS MUCH LIKE YOURSELF AS YOU CAN BEFORE HE HESITATED
248-130697-0029 BEFORE MY MOTHER COMES SAID GWENDOLEN AH I MUST BE CHANGED I HAVE NOT LOOKED AT MYSELF SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME SHE ADDED TURNING TOWARD HIM IF YOU HAD MET ME NOW
248-130697-0030 SHOULD YOU HAVE KNOWN ME FOR THE ONE YOU SAW AT LEUBRONN YES I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN YOU SAID DERONDA MOURNFULLY THE OUTSIDE CHANGE IS NOT GREAT I SHOULD HAVE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT WAS YOU AND THAT YOU HAD GONE THROUGH SOME GREAT SORROW
248-130697-0031 DON'T WISH NOW THAT YOU HAD NEVER SEEN ME DON'T WISH THAT SAID GWENDOLEN IMPLORINGLY WHILE THE TEARS GATHERED I SHOULD DESPISE MYSELF FOR WISHING IT SAID DERONDA HOW COULD I KNOW WHAT I WAS WISHING
248-130697-0032 WE MUST FIND OUR DUTIES IN WHAT COMES TO US NOT IN WHAT WE IMAGINE MIGHT HAVE BEEN IF I TOOK TO FOOLISH WISHING OF THAT SORT I SHOULD WISH NOT THAT I HAD NEVER SEEN YOU BUT THAT I HAD BEEN ABLE TO SAVE YOU FROM THIS
248-130697-0033 YOU HAVE SAVED ME FROM WORSE SAID GWENDOLEN IN A SOBBING VOICE
248-130697-0034 IT WILL BE BETTER FOR ME TO GO NOW SAID DERONDA WORN IN SPIRIT BY THE PERPETUAL STRAIN OF THIS SCENE REMEMBER WHAT WE SAID OF YOUR TASK TO GET WELL AND CALM BEFORE OTHER FRIENDS COME
248-130697-0035 HE ROSE AS HE SPOKE AND SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND SUBMISSIVELY BUT WHEN HE HAD LEFT HER SHE SANK ON HER KNEES IN HYSTERICAL CRYING THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WAS TOO GREAT
248-130697-0036 BEHOLDING A POSSIBLE LIFE WHICH SHE HAD SINNED HERSELF AWAY FROM
250-140277-0000 THIS BOOK OWES ITS ORIGIN TO THE FACT THAT IN THE AUTUMN OF NINETEEN TWENTY ONE THE AUTHORITIES OF MANCHESTER COLLEGE OXFORD INVITED ME TO DELIVER THE INAUGURAL COURSE OF A LECTURESHIP IN RELIGION NEWLY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE WILL OF THE LATE PROFESSOR UPTON
250-140277-0001 NO CONDITIONS BEING ATTACHED TO THIS APPOINTMENT IT SEEMED A SUITABLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SO FAR AS POSSIBLE IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE MOMENT SOME OF THE IMPLICITS WHICH I BELIEVE TO UNDERLIE HUMAN EFFORT
250-140277-0002 AND ACHIEVEMENT IN THE DOMAIN OF THE SPIRITUAL LIFE THE MATERIAL GATHERED FOR THIS PURPOSE HAS NOW BEEN ADDED TO REVISED AND TO SOME EXTENT RE WRITTEN
250-140277-0003 OR WHO ARE OFFENDED BY THE RESULTING DEMONSTRATIONS OF CONTINUITY BETWEEN OUR MOST HOMELY AND MOST LOFTY REACTIONS TO THE UNIVERSE MIGHT TAKE TO THEMSELVES THE PLAIN WORDS OF THOMAS A KEMPIS THOU ART A MAN AND NOT GOD THOU ART FLESH
250-140277-0004 AND NO ANGEL SINCE MY SUBJECT IS NOT THE SPLENDOR OF HISTORIC SANCTITY BUT THE NORMAL LIFE OF THE SPIRIT AS IT MAY BE AND IS LIVED IN THE HERE AND NOW
250-140277-0005 NO ATTENTION HAS BEEN GIVEN TO THOSE ABNORMAL EXPERIENCES AND STATES OF CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH TOO OFTEN REGARDED AS SPECIALLY MYSTICAL ARE NOW RECOGNIZED BY ALL COMPETENT STUDENTS AS REPRESENTING THE UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENTS
250-140277-0006 RATHER THAN THE ABIDING SUBSTANCE OF SPIRITUALITY READERS OF THESE PAGES WILL FIND NOTHING ABOUT TRANCES ECSTASIES AND OTHER RARE PSYCHIC PHENOMENA WHICH SOMETIMES INDICATE HOLINESS AND SOMETIMES ONLY DISEASE
250-140277-0007 FOR INFORMATION ON THESE MATTERS THEY MUST GO TO LARGER AND MORE TECHNICAL WORKS MY AIM HERE IS THE MORE GENERAL ONE OF INDICATING FIRST THE CHARACTERISTIC EXPERIENCES DISCOVERABLE WITHIN ALL GREAT RELIGIONS
250-140277-0008 WHICH JUSTIFY OR ARE FUNDAMENTAL TO THE SPIRITUAL LIFE AND THE WAY IN WHICH THESE EXPERIENCES MAY BE ACCOMMODATED TO THE WORLD VIEW OF THE MODERN MAN AND NEXT THE NATURE OF THAT SPIRITUAL LIFE AS IT APPEARS IN HUMAN HISTORY
250-140277-0009 THE SUCCEEDING SECTIONS OF THE BOOK TREAT IN SOME DETAIL THE LIGHT CAST ON SPIRITUAL PROBLEMS BY MENTAL ANALYSIS A PROCESS WHICH NEED NOT NECESSARILY BE CONDUCTED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A DEGRADED MATERIALISM
250-140277-0010 AND BY RECENT WORK ON THE PSYCHOLOGY OF AUTISTIC THOUGHT AND OF SUGGESTION THESE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE A PRACTICAL INTEREST FOR EVERY MAN WHO DESIRES TO BE THE CAPTAIN OF HIS SOUL

250-142276-0000 CHAPTER TWO ROSES AND THORNS BY THE SOFT GREEN LIGHT IN THE WOODY GLADE ON THE BANKS OF MOSS WHERE THY CHILDHOOD PLAYED BY THE HOUSEHOLD TREE
250-142276-0001 HER MOTHER HAD BEEN DETAINED AT HOME BY A MULTITUDE OF HALF REASONS NONE OF WHICH ANYBODY FULLY UNDERSTOOD EXCEPT MISTER HALE WHO WAS PERFECTLY AWARE THAT ALL HIS ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF A GREY SATIN GOWN
250-142276-0002 WHICH WAS MIDWAY BETWEEN OLDNESS AND NEWNESS HAD PROVED UNAVAILING AND THAT AS HE HAD NOT THE MONEY TO EQUIP HIS WIFE AFRESH FROM TOP TO TOE SHE WOULD NOT SHOW HERSELF AT HER ONLY SISTER'S ONLY CHILD'S WEDDING
250-142276-0003 IF MISSUS SHAW HAD GUESSED AT THE REAL REASON WHY MISSUS HALE DID NOT ACCOMPANY HER HUSBAND SHE WOULD HAVE SHOWERED DOWN GOWNS UPON HER BUT IT WAS NEARLY TWENTY YEARS SINCE MISSUS SHAW HAD BEEN THE POOR PRETTY MISS BERESFORD
250-142276-0004 AND SHE HAD REALLY FORGOTTEN ALL GRIEVANCES EXCEPT THAT OF THE UNHAPPINESS ARISING FROM DISPARITY OF AGE IN MARRIED LIFE ON WHICH SHE COULD DESCANT BY THE HALF HOUR DEAREST MARIA HAD MARRIED THE MAN OF HER HEART
250-142276-0005 ONLY EIGHT YEARS OLDER THAN HERSELF WITH THE SWEETEST TEMPER AND THAT BLUE BLACK HAIR ONE SO SELDOM SEES MISTER HALE WAS ONE OF THE MOST DELIGHTFUL PREACHERS SHE HAD EVER HEARD AND A PERFECT MODEL OF A PARISH PRIEST
250-142276-0006 PERHAPS IT WAS NOT QUITE A LOGICAL DEDUCTION FROM ALL THESE PREMISES BUT IT WAS STILL MISSUS SHAW'S CHARACTERISTIC CONCLUSION AS SHE THOUGHT OVER HER SISTER'S LOT
250-142276-0007 MISSUS HALE IF SHE SPOKE TRUTH MIGHT HAVE ANSWERED WITH A READY MADE LIST
250-142276-0008 A WHITE CHIP BONNET OH DOZENS OF THINGS FOR THE WEDDING AND HUNDREDS OF THINGS FOR THE HOUSE MARGARET ONLY KNEW THAT HER MOTHER HAD NOT FOUND IT CONVENIENT TO COME
250-142276-0009 AND SHE WAS NOT SORRY TO THINK THAT THEIR MEETING AND GREETING WOULD TAKE PLACE AT HELSTONE PARSONAGE RATHER THAN DURING THE CONFUSION OF THE LAST TWO OR THREE DAYS IN THE HOUSE IN HARLEY STREET WHERE SHE HERSELF HAD HAD TO PLAY THE PART OF FIGARO
250-142276-0010 AND WAS WANTED EVERYWHERE AT ONE AND THE SAME TIME HER MIND AND BODY ACHED NOW WITH THE RECOLLECTION OF ALL SHE HAD DONE AND SAID WITHIN THE LAST FORTY EIGHT HOURS THE FAREWELLS SO HURRIEDLY TAKEN AMONGST ALL THE OTHER GOOD BYES
250-142276-0011 OF THOSE SHE HAD LIVED WITH SO LONG OPPRESSED HER NOW WITH A SAD REGRET FOR THE TIMES THAT WERE NO MORE IT DID NOT SIGNIFY WHAT THOSE TIMES HAD BEEN THEY WERE GONE NEVER TO RETURN MARGARET'S HEART FELT MORE HEAVY
250-142276-0012 THE PLACE AND THE LIFE SHE HAD LONGED FOR FOR YEARS AT THAT TIME OF ALL TIMES FOR YEARNING AND LONGING JUST BEFORE THE SHARP SENSES LOSE THEIR OUTLINES IN SLEEP
250-142276-0013 HER DEAR FATHER LEANING BACK ASLEEP IN THE RAILWAY CARRIAGE HIS BLUE BLACK HAIR WAS GREY NOW AND LAY THINLY OVER HIS BROWS THE BONES OF HIS FACE WERE PLAINLY TO BE SEEN
250-142276-0014 TOO PLAINLY FOR BEAUTY IF HIS FEATURES HAD BEEN LESS FINELY CUT AS IT WAS THEY HAD A GRACE IF NOT A COMELINESS OF THEIR OWN THE FACE WAS IN REPOSE BUT IT WAS RATHER REST AFTER WEARINESS
250-142276-0015 THAN THE SERENE CALM OF THE COUNTENANCE OF ONE WHO LED A PLACID CONTENTED LIFE MARGARET WAS PAINFULLY STRUCK BY THE WORN ANXIOUS EXPRESSION AND SHE WENT BACK OVER THE OPEN AND AVOWED CIRCUMSTANCES OF HER FATHER'S LIFE
250-142276-0016 TO FIND THE CAUSE FOR THE LINES THAT SPOKE SO PLAINLY OF HABITUAL DISTRESS AND DEPRESSION POOR FREDERICK THOUGHT SHE SIGHING OH IF FREDERICK HAD BUT BEEN A CLERGYMAN INSTEAD OF GOING INTO THE NAVY AND BEING LOST TO US ALL
250-142276-0017 I WISH I KNEW ALL ABOUT IT I NEVER UNDERSTOOD IT FROM AUNT SHAW I ONLY KNEW HE COULD NOT COME BACK TO ENGLAND BECAUSE OF THAT TERRIBLE AFFAIR POOR DEAR PAPA HOW SAD HE LOOKS
250-142276-0018 I AM SO GLAD I AM GOING HOME TO BE AT HAND TO COMFORT HIM AND MAMMA SHE WAS READY WITH A BRIGHT SMILE IN WHICH THERE WAS NOT A TRACE OF FATIGUE TO GREET HER FATHER WHEN HE AWAKENED HE SMILED BACK AGAIN BUT
250-142276-0019 FAINTLY AS IF IT WERE AN UNUSUAL EXERTION HIS FACE RETURNED INTO ITS LINES OF HABITUAL ANXIETY HE HAD A TRICK OF HALF OPENING HIS MOUTH AS IF TO SPEAK WHICH CONSTANTLY UNSETTLED THE FORM OF THE LIPS
250-142276-0020 AND GAVE THE FACE AN UNDECIDED EXPRESSION BUT HE HAD THE SAME LARGE SOFT EYES AS HIS DAUGHTER EYES WHICH MOVED SLOWLY AND ALMOST GRANDLY ROUND IN THEIR ORBITS AND WERE WELL VEILED BY THEIR TRANSPARENT WHITE EYELIDS
250-142276-0021 NO ROSEBUD THAT COULD ONLY OPEN JUST ENOUGH TO LET OUT A YES AND NO AND AN'T PLEASE YOU SIR BUT THE WIDE MOUTH WAS ONE SOFT CURVE OF RICH RED LIPS AND THE SKIN IF NOT WHITE AND FAIR
250-142276-0022 WAS OF AN IVORY SMOOTHNESS AND DELICACY IF THE LOOK ON HER FACE WAS IN GENERAL TOO DIGNIFIED AND RESERVED FOR ONE SO YOUNG NOW TALKING TO HER FATHER IT WAS BRIGHT AS THE MORNING
250-142276-0023 FULL OF DIMPLES AND GLANCES THAT SPOKE OF CHILDISH GLADNESS AND BOUNDLESS HOPE IN THE FUTURE IT WAS THE LATTER PART OF JULY WHEN MARGARET RETURNED HOME THE FOREST TREES WERE ALL ONE DARK FULL DUSKY GREEN
250-142276-0024 THE FERN BELOW THEM CAUGHT ALL THE SLANTING SUNBEAMS THE WEATHER WAS SULTRY AND BROODINGLY STILL MARGARET USED TO TRAMP ALONG BY HER FATHER'S SIDE CRUSHING DOWN THE FERN WITH A CRUEL GLEE
250-142276-0025 AS SHE FELT IT YIELD UNDER HER LIGHT FOOT AND SEND UP THE FRAGRANCE PECULIAR TO IT OUT ON THE BROAD COMMONS INTO THE WARM SCENTED LIGHT SEEING MULTITUDES OF WILD FREE LIVING CREATURES REVELLING IN THE SUNSHINE
250-142276-0026 THIS LIFE AT LEAST THESE WALKS REALISED ALL MARGARET'S ANTICIPATIONS SHE TOOK A PRIDE IN HER FOREST ITS PEOPLE WERE HER PEOPLE SHE MADE HEARTY FRIENDS WITH THEM
250-142276-0027 LEARNED AND DELIGHTED IN USING THEIR PECULIAR WORDS TOOK UP HER FREEDOM AMONGST THEM NURSED THEIR BABIES TALKED OR READ WITH SLOW DISTINCTNESS TO THEIR OLD PEOPLE
250-142276-0028 CARRIED DAINTY MESSES TO THEIR SICK RESOLVED BEFORE LONG TO TEACH AT THE SCHOOL WHERE HER FATHER WENT EVERY DAY AS TO AN APPOINTED TASK BUT SHE WAS CONTINUALLY TEMPTED OFF TO GO AND SEE SOME INDIVIDUAL FRIEND
250-142276-0029 MAN WOMAN OR CHILD IN SOME COTTAGE IN THE GREEN SHADE OF THE FOREST HER OUT OF DOORS LIFE WAS PERFECT HER IN DOORS LIFE HAD ITS DRAWBACKS
250-142276-0030 WITH THE HEALTHY SHAME OF A CHILD SHE BLAMED HERSELF FOR HER KEENNESS OF SIGHT IN PERCEIVING THAT ALL WAS NOT AS IT SHOULD BE THERE HER MOTHER HER MOTHER ALWAYS SO KIND AND TENDER TOWARDS HER
250-142276-0031 BUT EVERY DAY HE WAS MORE OVERPOWERED THE WORLD BECAME MORE BEWILDERING AT EACH REPEATED URGENCY OF HIS WIFE THAT HE WOULD PUT HIMSELF IN THE WAY OF SEEKING SOME PREFERMENT
250-142276-0032 AND MARGARET WOULD TRY TO TEMPT HER FORTH ON TO THE BEAUTIFUL BROAD UPLAND SUN STREAKED CLOUD SHADOWED COMMON FOR SHE WAS SURE THAT HER MOTHER HAD ACCUSTOMED HERSELF TOO MUCH TO AN IN DOORS LIFE SELDOM EXTENDING HER WALKS BEYOND THE CHURCH
250-142276-0033 THE SCHOOL AND THE NEIGHBOURING COTTAGES THIS DID GOOD FOR A TIME BUT WHEN THE AUTUMN DREW ON AND THE WEATHER BECAME MORE CHANGEABLE HER MOTHER'S IDEA OF THE UNHEALTHINESS OF THE PLACE INCREASED
250-142276-0034 AND SHE REPINED EVEN MORE FREQUENTLY THAT HER HUSBAND WHO WAS MORE LEARNED THAN MISTER HUME A BETTER PARISH PRIEST THAN MISTER HOULDSWORTH SHOULD NOT HAVE MET WITH THE PREFERMENT THAT THESE TWO FORMER NEIGHBOURS OF THEIRS HAD DONE
250-142276-0035 THAT SHE SHOULD HAVE TO GIVE UP MANY LUXURIES WHICH HAD ONLY BEEN TROUBLES AND TRAMMELS TO HER FREEDOM IN HARLEY STREET HER KEEN ENJOYMENT OF EVERY SENSUOUS PLEASURE WAS BALANCED FINELY IF NOT OVERBALANCED
250-142276-0036 BY HER CONSCIOUS PRIDE IN BEING ABLE TO DO WITHOUT THEM ALL IF NEED WERE BUT THE CLOUD NEVER COMES IN THAT QUARTER OF THE HORIZON FROM WHICH WE WATCH FOR IT THERE HAD BEEN SLIGHT COMPLAINTS AND PASSING REGRETS ON HER MOTHER'S PART
250-142276-0037 NOT SO PLEASANT IN THE LATTER HALF OF SEPTEMBER THE AUTUMNAL RAINS AND STORMS CAME ON AND MARGARET WAS OBLIGED TO REMAIN MORE IN THE HOUSE THAN SHE HAD HITHERTO DONE
250-142276-0038 HELSTONE WAS AT SOME DISTANCE FROM ANY NEIGHBOURS OF THEIR OWN STANDARD OF CULTIVATION IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY ONE OF THE MOST OUT OF THE WAY PLACES IN ENGLAND SAID MISSUS HALE IN ONE OF HER PLAINTIVE MOODS
250-142276-0039 IF WE ONLY LIVED AT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE PARISH IT WOULD BE SOMETHING THERE WE SHOULD BE ALMOST WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE OF THE STANSFIELDS CERTAINLY THE GORMANS WOULD BE WITHIN A WALK GORMANS SAID MARGARET
250-142276-0040 ARE THOSE THE GORMANS WHO MADE THEIR FORTUNES IN TRADE AT SOUTHAMPTON OH I'M GLAD WE DON'T VISIT THEM I DON'T LIKE SHOPPY PEOPLE I THINK WE ARE FAR BETTER OFF KNOWING ONLY COTTAGERS AND LABOURERS
250-142276-0041 I CALL MINE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE TASTE I LIKE ALL PEOPLE WHOSE OCCUPATIONS HAVE TO DO WITH LAND I LIKE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND THE THREE LEARNED PROFESSIONS AS THEY CALL THEM
250-142276-0042 AND WITH THE SOFT VIOLENCE OF THE WEST WIND BEHIND HER AS SHE CROSSED SOME HEATH SHE SEEMED TO BE BORNE ONWARDS AS LIGHTLY AND EASILY AS THE FALLEN LEAF THAT WAS WAFTED ALONG BY THE AUTUMNAL BREEZE
250-142276-0043 BUT THE EVENINGS WERE RATHER DIFFICULT TO FILL UP AGREEABLY IMMEDIATELY AFTER TEA HER FATHER WITHDREW INTO HIS SMALL LIBRARY AND SHE AND HER MOTHER WERE LEFT ALONE MISSUS HALE HAD NEVER CARED MUCH FOR BOOKS
250-142276-0044 AND HAD DISCOURAGED HER HUSBAND VERY EARLY IN THEIR MARRIED LIFE IN HIS DESIRE OF READING ALOUD TO HER WHILE SHE WORKED AT ONE TIME THEY HAD TRIED BACKGAMMON AS A RESOURCE BUT AS MISTER HALE GREW TO TAKE AN INCREASING INTEREST IN HIS SCHOOL AND HIS PARISHIONERS
250-142276-0045 HE FOUND THAT THE INTERRUPTIONS WHICH AROSE OUT OF THESE DUTIES WERE REGARDED AS HARDSHIPS BY HIS WIFE NOT TO BE ACCEPTED AS THE NATURAL CONDITIONS OF HIS PROFESSION BUT TO BE REGRETTED AND STRUGGLED AGAINST BY HER AS THEY SEVERALLY AROSE
250-142276-0046 SO HE WITHDREW WHILE THE CHILDREN WERE YET YOUNG INTO HIS LIBRARY TO SPEND HIS EVENINGS IF HE WERE AT HOME IN READING THE SPECULATIVE AND METAPHYSICAL BOOKS WHICH WERE HIS DELIGHT
250-142276-0047 WHEN MARGARET HAD BEEN HERE BEFORE SHE HAD BROUGHT DOWN WITH HER A GREAT BOX OF BOOKS RECOMMENDED BY MASTERS OR GOVERNESS AND HAD FOUND THE SUMMER'S DAY ALL TOO SHORT TO GET THROUGH THE READING SHE HAD TO DO BEFORE HER RETURN TO TOWN
250-142276-0048 NOW THERE WERE ONLY THE WELL BOUND LITTLE READ ENGLISH CLASSICS WHICH WERE WEEDED OUT OF HER FATHER'S LIBRARY TO FILL UP THE SMALL BOOK SHELVES IN THE DRAWING ROOM THOMSON'S SEASONS HAYLEY'S COWPER MIDDLETON'S CICERO
250-142276-0049 WERE BY FAR THE LIGHTEST NEWEST AND MOST AMUSING THE BOOK SHELVES DID NOT AFFORD MUCH RESOURCE MARGARET TOLD HER MOTHER EVERY PARTICULAR OF HER LONDON LIFE TO ALL OF WHICH MISSUS HALE LISTENED WITH INTEREST
250-142276-0050 SOMETIMES AMUSED AND QUESTIONING AT OTHERS A LITTLE INCLINED TO COMPARE HER SISTER'S CIRCUMSTANCES OF EASE AND COMFORT WITH THE NARROWER MEANS AT HELSTONE VICARAGE ON SUCH EVENINGS MARGARET WAS APT TO STOP TALKING RATHER ABRUPTLY
250-142276-0051 ONCE OR TWICE MARGARET FOUND HERSELF MECHANICALLY COUNTING THE REPETITION OF THE MONOTONOUS SOUND WHILE SHE WONDERED IF SHE MIGHT VENTURE TO PUT A QUESTION ON A SUBJECT VERY NEAR TO HER HEART AND ASK WHERE FREDERICK WAS NOW
250-142276-0052 THE FULL ACCOUNT OF WHICH MARGARET HAD NEVER HEARD AND WHICH NOW SEEMED DOOMED TO BE BURIED IN SAD OBLIVION
250-142276-0053 WHEN SHE WAS WITH HER MOTHER HER FATHER SEEMED THE BEST PERSON TO APPLY TO FOR INFORMATION AND WHEN WITH HIM
250-142276-0054 HIS ROOM WAS KEPT EXACTLY AS HE HAD LEFT IT AND WAS REGULARLY DUSTED AND PUT INTO ORDER BY DIXON MISSUS HALE'S MAID WHO TOUCHED NO OTHER PART OF THE HOUSEHOLD WORK
250-142276-0055 BUT ALWAYS REMEMBERED THE DAY WHEN SHE HAD BEEN ENGAGED BY LADY BERESFORD AS LADIES MAID TO SIR JOHN'S WARDS THE PRETTY MISS BERESFORDS THE BELLES OF RUTLANDSHIRE
250-142276-0056 ALIAS HER MARRIED LIFE SHE REMAINED WITH HER AND WAS DEVOTED TO HER INTERESTS ALWAYS CONSIDERING HERSELF AS THE GOOD AND PROTECTING FAIRY WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO BAFFLE THE MALIGNANT GIANT MISTER HALE
250-142276-0057 HE WOULD BE DEPRESSED FOR MANY DAYS AFTER WITNESSING A DEATH BED OR HEARING OF ANY CRIME BUT NOW MARGARET NOTICED AN ABSENCE OF MIND AS IF HIS THOUGHTS WERE PRE OCCUPIED BY SOME SUBJECT
250-142276-0058 THE OPPRESSION OF WHICH COULD NOT BE RELIEVED BY ANY DAILY ACTION SUCH AS COMFORTING THE SURVIVORS OR TEACHING AT THE SCHOOL IN HOPE OF LESSENING THE EVILS IN THE GENERATION TO COME MISTER HALE DID NOT GO OUT AMONG HIS PARISHIONERS AS MUCH AS USUAL
250-142276-0059 A SIGNAL WHICH AT ONE TIME HAD OFTEN TO BE REPEATED BEFORE ANY ONE WAS SUFFICIENTLY ALIVE TO THE HOUR OF THE DAY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WAS AND ATTEND TO HIM NOW MISTER HALE LOITERED ABOUT THE GARDEN IF THE MORNING WAS FINE AND IF NOT
250-142276-0060 HALF CONFIDENTIAL SHAKE OF THE HEAD TO THE PARSON WHO WATCHED HIM AWAY BEYOND THE SWEET BRIAR HEDGE AND PAST THE GREAT ARBUTUS BEFORE HE TURNED INTO THE ROOM TO BEGIN HIS DAY'S WORK WITH ALL THE SIGNS OF A HEAVY HEART
250-142276-0061 NOT ABSOLUTELY BASED ON A KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS IS EASILY BANISHED FOR A TIME BY A BRIGHT SUNNY DAY OR SOME HAPPY OUTWARD CIRCUMSTANCE AND WHEN THE BRILLIANT FOURTEEN FINE DAYS OF OCTOBER CAME ON
250-142276-0062 SHE HAD LEARNT DRAWING WITH EDITH AND SHE HAD SUFFICIENTLY REGRETTED DURING THE GLOOM OF THE BAD WEATHER HER IDLE REVELLING IN THE BEAUTY OF THE WOODLANDS WHILE IT HAD YET BEEN FINE TO MAKE HER DETERMINED TO SKETCH WHAT SHE COULD
250-142276-0063 BEFORE WINTER FAIRLY SET IN ACCORDINGLY SHE WAS BUSY PREPARING HER BOARD ONE MORNING WHEN SARAH THE HOUSEMAID THREW WIDE OPEN THE DRAWING ROOM DOOR AND ANNOUNCED
250-142286-0000 CHAPTER TWELVE MORNING CALLS WELL I SUPPOSE WE MUST FRIENDS IN COUNCIL
250-142286-0001 MISTER THORNTON HAD HAD SOME DIFFICULTY IN WORKING UP HIS MOTHER TO THE DESIRED POINT OF CIVILITY SHE DID NOT OFTEN MAKE CALLS AND WHEN SHE DID IT WAS IN HEAVY STATE THAT SHE WENT THROUGH HER DUTIES
250-142286-0002 BUT SHE REFUSED TO LET HIM KEEP HORSES FOR IT THEY WERE HIRED FOR THE SOLEMN OCCASIONS WHEN SHE PAID MORNING OR EVENING VISITS SHE HAD HAD HORSES FOR THREE DAYS NOT A FORTNIGHT BEFORE
250-142286-0003 WHO MIGHT NOW PUT THEMSELVES TO TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THEIR TURN YET CRAMPTON WAS TOO FAR OFF FOR HER TO WALK AND SHE HAD REPEATEDLY QUESTIONED HER SON AS TO WHETHER HIS WISH THAT SHE SHOULD CALL ON THE HALES WAS STRONG ENOUGH TO BEAR THE EXPENSE OF CAB HIRE
250-142286-0004 THE LAST TIME YOU WERE OUT IN A CAB YOU CAME HOME WITH A HEADACHE FROM THE JOLTING I NEVER COMPLAINED OF IT I'M SURE NO
250-142286-0005 BUT SO MUCH THE MORE I HAVE TO WATCH OVER YOU NOW AS FOR FANNY THERE A LITTLE HARDSHIP WOULD DO HER GOOD SHE IS NOT MADE OF THE SAME STUFF AS YOU ARE JOHN SHE COULD NOT BEAR IT
250-142286-0006 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SILENT AFTER THIS FOR HER LAST WORDS BORE RELATION TO A SUBJECT WHICH MORTIFIED HER SHE HAD AN UNCONSCIOUS CONTEMPT FOR A WEAK CHARACTER AND FANNY WAS WEAK IN THE VERY POINTS IN WHICH HER MOTHER AND BROTHER WERE STRONG
250-142286-0007 MISSUS THORNTON WAS NOT A WOMAN MUCH GIVEN TO REASONING HER QUICK JUDGMENT AND FIRM RESOLUTION SERVED HER IN GOOD STEAD OF ANY LONG ARGUMENTS AND DISCUSSIONS WITH HERSELF SHE FELT INSTINCTIVELY THAT NOTHING COULD STRENGTHEN FANNY TO ENDURE HARDSHIPS PATIENTLY
250-142286-0008 WHICH THE UNEASY TENDERNESS OF MISSUS THORNTON'S MANNER TO HER DAUGHTER THE SHAME WITH WHICH SHE THOUGHT TO HIDE THE POVERTY OF HER CHILD IN ALL THE GRAND QUALITIES WHICH SHE HERSELF POSSESSED UNCONSCIOUSLY AND WHICH SHE SET SO HIGH A VALUE UPON IN OTHERS
250-142286-0009 THIS SHAME I SAY BETRAYED THE WANT OF A SECURE RESTING PLACE FOR HER AFFECTION SHE NEVER CALLED HER SON BY ANY NAME BUT JOHN LOVE AND DEAR AND SUCH LIKE TERMS WERE RESERVED FOR FANNY
250-142286-0010 BUT HER HEART GAVE THANKS FOR HIM DAY AND NIGHT AND SHE WALKED PROUDLY AMONG WOMEN FOR HIS SAKE FANNY DEAR I SHALL HAVE HORSES TO THE CARRIAGE TO DAY TO GO AND CALL ON THESE HALES
250-142286-0011 WITH WHAT ASKED MISSUS THORNTON HER BROW SLIGHTLY CONTRACTING
250-142286-0012 MISSUS THORNTON DID NOT SPEAK BUT SHE LAID HER WORK ON THE TABLE AND SEEMED TO THINK IT WILL BE A LONG WAY FOR HER TO WALK BACK AT NIGHT
250-142286-0013 AT THIS POINT MISTER THORNTON CAME IN JUST BEFORE GOING TO THE MILL MOTHER I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT IF THERE IS ANY LITTLE THING THAT COULD SERVE MISSUS HALE AS AN INVALID YOU WILL OFFER IT I'M SURE IF I CAN FIND IT OUT I WILL
250-142286-0014 IT WILL DO YOU GOOD INSTEAD OF HARM
250-142286-0015 HE WENT ABRUPTLY OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER SAYING THIS IF HE HAD STAID A MINUTE LONGER FANNY WOULD HAVE CRIED AT HIS TONE OF COMMAND EVEN WHEN HE USED THE WORDS YOU WILL OBLIGE ME
250-142286-0016 FANNY DON'T SPEAK SO OF YOUR BROTHER HE HAS GOOD REASONS OF SOME KIND OR OTHER OR HE WOULD NOT WISH US TO GO MAKE HASTE AND PUT YOUR THINGS ON
250-142286-0017 BUT THE LITTLE ALTERCATION BETWEEN HER SON AND HER DAUGHTER DID NOT INCLINE MISSUS THORNTON MORE FAVOURABLY TOWARDS THESE HALES HER JEALOUS HEART REPEATED HER DAUGHTER'S QUESTION
250-142286-0018 MISSUS THORNTON WAS SHY IT WAS ONLY OF LATE YEARS THAT SHE HAD HAD LEISURE ENOUGH IN HER LIFE TO GO INTO SOCIETY AND AS SOCIETY SHE DID NOT ENJOY IT
250-142286-0019 AS DINNER GIVING AND AS CRITICISING OTHER PEOPLE'S DINNERS SHE TOOK SATISFACTION IN IT BUT THIS GOING TO MAKE ACQUAINTANCE WITH STRANGERS WAS A VERY DIFFERENT THING
250-142286-0020 AS MISSUS THORNTON OBSERVED TO HERSELF SHE LIKED MISSUS HALE'S DOUBLE KNITTING FAR BETTER THAT WAS SENSIBLE OF ITS KIND THE ROOM ALTOGETHER WAS FULL OF KNICK KNACKS WHICH MUST TAKE A LONG TIME TO DUST AND TIME TO PEOPLE OF LIMITED INCOME WAS MONEY
250-142286-0021 MISSUS HALE WAS MAKING RATHER MORE EXERTION IN HER ANSWERS CAPTIVATED BY SOME REAL OLD LACE WHICH MISSUS THORNTON WORE LACE AS SHE AFTERWARDS OBSERVED TO DIXON OF THAT OLD ENGLISH POINT WHICH HAS NOT BEEN MADE FOR THIS SEVENTY YEARS AND
250-142286-0022 WHICH CANNOT BE BOUGHT IT MUST HAVE BEEN AN HEIR LOOM AND SHOWS THAT SHE HAD ANCESTORS SO THE OWNER OF THE ANCESTRAL LACE BECAME WORTHY OF SOMETHING MORE THAN THE LANGUID EXERTION TO BE AGREEABLE TO A VISITOR
250-142286-0023 FIFTEEN SHILLINGS A WEEK AND THREE SAVED OUT OF THEM THOUGHT MARGARET TO HERSELF BUT SHE MUST HAVE BEEN VERY YOUNG SHE PROBABLY HAS FORGOTTEN HER OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BUT SHE MUST KNOW OF THOSE DAYS
250-142286-0024 MARGARET'S MANNER HAD AN EXTRA TINGE OF COLDNESS IN IT WHEN SHE NEXT SPOKE YOU HAVE GOOD CONCERTS HERE I BELIEVE
250-142286-0025 TOO CROWDED THAT IS THE WORST
250-142286-0026 BUT SURELY IT IS A VERY EASY JOURNEY TO LONDON YES BUT SOMEHOW SAID FANNY LOWERING HER VOICE MAMMA HAS NEVER BEEN TO LONDON HERSELF AND CAN'T UNDERSTAND MY LONGING
250-142286-0027 MAY I INQUIRE MARGARET HAD NOT THE WORDS READY FOR AN ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WHICH TOOK HER A LITTLE BY SURPRISE SO MISS THORNTON REPLIED
250-142286-0028 AS FANNY HAD PUT IT IT DID SEEM AS IF THEY HAD BEEN IMPERTINENTLY DISCUSSING MISSUS THORNTON'S FEELINGS BUT SHE ALSO ROSE UP AGAINST THAT LADY'S MANNER OF SHOWING THAT SHE WAS OFFENDED MISSUS THORNTON WENT ON AFTER A MOMENT'S PAUSE
250-142286-0029 DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING OF MILTON MISS HALE HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF OUR FACTORIES OUR MAGNIFICENT WAREHOUSES NO SAID MARGARET I HAVE NOT SEEN ANYTHING OF THAT DESCRIPTION AS YET
250-142286-0030 THEN SHE FELT THAT BY CONCEALING HER UTTER INDIFFERENCE TO ALL SUCH PLACES SHE WAS HARDLY SPEAKING WITH TRUTH SO SHE WENT ON
250-142286-0031 EVERY IMPROVEMENT OF MACHINERY IS I BELIEVE TO BE SEEN THERE IN ITS HIGHEST PERFECTION I AM SO GLAD YOU DON'T LIKE MILLS AND MANUFACTORIES AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS SAID FANNY IN A HALF WHISPER
250-142286-0032 SHE WILL DO YOU NO GOOD I SEE THE MOTHER LOOKS VERY ILL AND SEEMS A NICE QUIET KIND OF PERSON
2514-149482-0000 HE RECEIVED FROM MISSUS LOWDER ON THE MORNING AFTER HIS VISIT TO KATE THE TELEGRAPHIC EXPRESSION OF A HOPE THAT HE MIGHT BE FREE TO DINE WITH THEM THAT EVENING AND HIS FREEDOM AFFECTED HIM AS FORTUNATE EVEN THOUGH IN SOME DEGREE QUALIFIED BY HER MISSIVE
2514-149482-0001 EXPECTING AMERICAN FRIENDS WHOM I'M SO GLAD TO FIND YOU KNOW HIS KNOWLEDGE OF AMERICAN FRIENDS WAS CLEARLY AN ACCIDENT OF WHICH HE WAS TO TASTE THE FRUIT TO THE LAST BITTERNESS THIS APPREHENSION HOWEVER WE HASTEN TO ADD
2514-149482-0002 ENJOYED FOR HIM IN THE IMMEDIATE EVENT A CERTAIN MERCIFUL SHRINKAGE THE IMMEDIATE EVENT BEING THAT AT LANCASTER GATE FIVE MINUTES AFTER HIS DUE ARRIVAL PRESCRIBED HIM FOR EIGHT THIRTY MISSUS STRINGHAM CAME IN ALONE
2514-149482-0003 THE LONG DAYLIGHT THE POSTPONED LAMPS THE HABIT OF THE HOUR MADE DINNERS LATE AND GUESTS STILL LATER SO THAT PUNCTUAL AS HE WAS HE HAD FOUND MISSUS LOWDER ALONE WITH KATE HERSELF NOT YET IN THE FIELD
2514-149482-0004 HE HAD THUS HAD WITH HER SEVERAL BEWILDERING MOMENTS BEWILDERING BY REASON FAIRLY OF THEIR TACIT INVITATION TO HIM TO BE SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLE THIS WAS EXACTLY GOODNESS KNEW WHAT HE WANTED TO BE
2514-149482-0005 BUT HE HAD NEVER HAD IT SO LARGELY AND FREELY SO SUPERNATURALLY SIMPLY FOR THAT MATTER IMPUTED TO HIM AS OF EASY ACHIEVEMENT IT WAS A PARTICULAR IN WHICH AUNT MAUD APPEARED TO OFFER HERSELF AS AN EXAMPLE APPEARED TO SAY QUITE AGREEABLY
2514-149482-0006 WHAT I WANT OF YOU DON'T YOU SEE IS TO BE JUST EXACTLY AS I AM THE QUANTITY OF THE ARTICLE REQUIRED WAS WHAT MIGHT ESPECIALLY HAVE CAUSED HIM TO STAGGER HE LIKED SO IN GENERAL THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH MISSUS LOWDER DEALT
2514-149482-0007 HE WOULD HAVE LIKED AS WELL TO ASK HER HOW FEASIBLE SHE SUPPOSED IT FOR A POOR YOUNG MAN TO RESEMBLE HER AT ANY POINT BUT HE HAD AFTER ALL SOON ENOUGH PERCEIVED THAT HE WAS DOING AS SHE WISHED BY LETTING HIS WONDER SHOW
2514-149482-0008 JUST A LITTLE AS SILLY HE WAS CONSCIOUS MOREOVER OF A SMALL STRANGE DREAD OF THE RESULTS OF DISCUSSION WITH HER STRANGE TRULY BECAUSE IT WAS HER GOOD NATURE NOT HER ASPERITY THAT HE FEARED ASPERITY MIGHT HAVE MADE HIM ANGRY
2514-149482-0009 IN WHICH THERE WAS ALWAYS A COMFORT GOOD NATURE IN HIS CONDITIONS HAD A TENDENCY TO MAKE HIM ASHAMED WHICH AUNT MAUD INDEED WONDERFULLY LIKING HIM FOR HIMSELF QUITE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING GUESSED TO SPARE HIM THEREFORE SHE ALSO AVOIDED DISCUSSION
2514-149482-0010 SHE KEPT HIM DOWN BY REFUSING TO QUARREL WITH HIM THIS WAS WHAT SHE NOW PROPOSED TO HIM TO ENJOY AND HIS SECRET DISCOMFORT WAS HIS SENSE THAT ON THE WHOLE IT WAS WHAT WOULD BEST SUIT HIM BEING KEPT DOWN WAS A BORE BUT
2514-149482-0011 HIS GREAT DREAD VERILY WAS OF BEING ASHAMED WHICH WAS A THING DISTINCT AND IT MATTERED BUT LITTLE THAT HE WAS ASHAMED OF THAT TOO IT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF HIS POSITION THAT IN SUCH A HOUSE AS THIS THE TABLES COULD ALWAYS BE TURNED ON HIM
2514-149482-0012 THE PLACE HOWEVER MUFFLED IN CONVENIENCE AND DECORUM CONSTANTLY HUMMED FOR HIM WITH THAT THICK IRONY
2514-149482-0013 AND HE HAD ALREADY SEEN HOW LITTLE AID CAME TO HIM FROM DENOUNCING THE BRIBES AS UGLY IN FORM THAT WAS WHAT THE PRECIOUS METALS THEY ALONE COULD AFFORD TO BE IT WAS VAIN ENOUGH FOR HIM ACCORDINGLY TO TRY TO IMPART A GLOSS TO HIS OWN COMPARATIVE BRUMMAGEM
2514-149482-0014 THE HUMILIATION OF THIS IMPOTENCE WAS PRECISELY WHAT AUNT MAUD SOUGHT TO MITIGATE FOR HIM BY KEEPING HIM DOWN AND AS HER EFFORT TO THAT END HAD DOUBTLESS NEVER YET BEEN SO VISIBLE HE HAD PROBABLY NEVER FELT SO DEFINITELY PLACED IN THE WORLD
2514-149482-0015 AS WHILE HE WAITED WITH HER FOR HER HALF DOZEN OTHER GUESTS SHE WELCOMED HIM GENIALLY BACK FROM THE STATES AS TO HIS VIEW OF WHICH HER FEW QUESTIONS THOUGH NOT COHERENT WERE COMPREHENSIVE
2514-149482-0016 AND HE HAD THE AMUSEMENT OF SEEING IN HER AS THROUGH A CLEAR GLASS THE OUTBREAK OF A PLAN AND THE SUDDEN CONSCIOUSNESS OF A CURIOSITY SHE BECAME AWARE OF AMERICA UNDER HIS EYES AS A POSSIBLE SCENE FOR SOCIAL OPERATIONS
2514-149482-0017 THE IDEA OF A VISIT TO THE WONDERFUL COUNTRY HAD CLEARLY BUT JUST OCCURRED TO HER YET SHE WAS TALKING OF IT AT THE END OF A MINUTE AS HER FAVOURITE DREAM HE DIDN'T BELIEVE IN IT BUT HE PRETENDED TO THIS HELPED HER AS WELL AS ANYTHING ELSE
2514-149482-0018 TO TREAT HIM AS HARMLESS AND BLAMELESS SHE WAS SO ENGAGED WITH THE FURTHER AID OF A COMPLETE ABSENCE OF ALLUSIONS WHEN THE HIGHEST EFFECT WAS GIVEN HER METHOD BY THE BEAUTIFUL ENTRANCE OF KATE THE METHOD THEREFORE RECEIVED SUPPORT ALL ROUND
2514-149482-0019 FOR NO YOUNG MAN COULD HAVE BEEN LESS FORMIDABLE THAN THE PERSON TO THE RELIEF OF WHOSE SHYNESS HER NIECE OSTENSIBLY CAME THE OSTENSIBLE IN KATE STRUCK HIM ALTOGETHER ON THIS OCCASION AS PRODIGIOUS
2514-149482-0020 WHILE SCARCELY LESS PRODIGIOUS FOR THAT MATTER WAS HIS OWN READING ON THE SPOT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN HIS COMPANIONS A RELATION LIGHTED FOR HIM BY THE STRAIGHT LOOK NOT EXACTLY LOVING NOR LINGERING YET SEARCHING AND SOFT
2514-149482-0021 THAT ON THE PART OF THEIR HOSTESS THE GIRL HAD TO RECKON WITH AS SHE ADVANCED IT TOOK HER IN FROM HEAD TO FOOT AND IN DOING SO IT TOLD A STORY THAT MADE POOR DENSHER AGAIN THE LEAST BIT SICK IT MARKED SO SOMETHING WITH WHICH KATE HABITUALLY
2514-149482-0022 AND CONSUMMATELY RECKONED THAT WAS THE STORY THAT SHE WAS ALWAYS FOR HER BENEFICENT DRAGON UNDER ARMS LIVING UP EVERY HOUR BUT ESPECIALLY AT FESTAL HOURS TO THE VALUE MISSUS LOWDER HAD ATTACHED TO HER
2514-149482-0023 HIGH AND FIXED THIS ESTIMATE RULED ON EACH OCCASION AT LANCASTER GATE THE SOCIAL SCENE SO THAT HE NOW RECOGNISED IN IT SOMETHING LIKE THE ARTISTIC IDEA THE PLASTIC SUBSTANCE IMPOSED BY TRADITION BY GENIUS BY CRITICISM
2514-149482-0024 IN RESPECT TO A GIVEN CHARACTER ON A DISTINGUISHED ACTRESS AS SUCH A PERSON WAS TO DRESS THE PART TO WALK TO LOOK TO SPEAK IN EVERY WAY TO EXPRESS THE PART SO ALL THIS WAS WHAT KATE WAS TO DO FOR THE CHARACTER SHE HAD UNDERTAKEN
2514-149482-0025 THINGS ALL PERFECTLY PONDERABLE TO CRITICISM AND THE WAY FOR HER TO MEET CRITICISM WAS EVIDENTLY AT THE START TO BE SURE HER MAKE UP HAD HAD THE LAST TOUCH AND THAT SHE LOOKED AT LEAST NO WORSE THAN USUAL
2514-149482-0026 AUNT MAUD'S APPRECIATION OF THAT TO NIGHT WAS INDEED MANAGERIAL AND THE PERFORMER'S OWN CONTRIBUTION FAIRLY THAT OF THE FAULTLESS SOLDIER ON PARADE DENSHER SAW HIMSELF FOR THE MOMENT AS IN HIS PURCHASED STALL AT THE PLAY
2514-149482-0027 THE WATCHFUL MANAGER WAS IN THE DEPTHS OF A BOX AND THE POOR ACTRESS IN THE GLARE OF THE FOOTLIGHTS BUT SHE PASSED THE POOR PERFORMER HE COULD SEE HOW SHE ALWAYS PASSED HER WIG HER PAINT HER JEWELS EVERY MARK OF HER EXPRESSION IMPECCABLE
2514-149482-0028 AND HER ENTRANCE ACCORDINGLY GREETED WITH THE PROPER ROUND OF APPLAUSE SUCH IMPRESSIONS AS WE THUS NOTE FOR DENSHER COME AND GO IT MUST BE GRANTED IN VERY MUCH LESS TIME THAN NOTATION DEMANDS BUT WE MAY NONE THE LESS MAKE THE POINT THAT THERE WAS STILL FURTHER
2514-149482-0029 TIME AMONG THEM FOR HIM TO FEEL ALMOST TOO SCARED TO TAKE PART IN THE OVATION HE STRUCK HIMSELF AS HAVING LOST FOR THE MINUTE HIS PRESENCE OF MIND SO THAT IN ANY CASE HE ONLY STARED IN SILENCE AT THE OLDER WOMAN'S TECHNICAL CHALLENGE
2514-149482-0030 IT WAS AS IF THE DRAMA IT THUS CAME TO HIM FOR THE FACT OF A DRAMA THERE WAS NO BLINKING WAS BETWEEN THEM THEM QUITE PREPONDERANTLY WITH MERTON DENSHER RELEGATED TO MERE SPECTATORSHIP A PAYING PLACE IN FRONT AND ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE
2514-149482-0031 THIS WAS WHY HIS APPRECIATION HAD TURNED FOR THE INSTANT TO FEAR HAD JUST TURNED AS WE HAVE SAID TO SICKNESS
2514-149482-0032 THAT THE DISCIPLINED FACE DID OFFER HIM OVER THE FOOTLIGHTS AS HE BELIEVED THE SMALL GLEAM FINE FAINT BUT EXQUISITE OF A SPECIAL INTELLIGENCE SO MIGHT A PRACTISED PERFORMER EVEN WHEN RAKED BY DOUBLE BARRELLED GLASSES SEEM TO BE ALL IN HER PART
2514-149482-0033 AND YET CONVEY A SIGN TO THE PERSON IN THE HOUSE SHE LOVED BEST THE DRAMA AT ALL EVENTS AS DENSHER SAW IT MEANWHILE WENT ON AMPLIFIED SOON ENOUGH BY THE ADVENT OF TWO OTHER GUESTS STRAY GENTLEMEN BOTH STRAGGLERS IN THE ROUT OF THE SEASON
2514-149482-0034 WHO VISIBLY PRESENTED THEMSELVES TO KATE DURING THE NEXT MOMENTS AS SUBJECTS FOR A LIKE IMPERSONAL TREATMENT AND SHARERS IN A LIKE USUAL MERCY AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SOCIAL COURSE THEY DISPLAYED IN RESPECT TO THE FIGURE
2514-149482-0035 THAT EACH IN HIS WAY MADE ONE THE EXPANSIVE THE OTHER THE CONTRACTILE EFFECT OF THE PERFECT WHITE WAISTCOAT A SCRATCH COMPANY OF TWO INNOCUOUS YOUTHS AND A PACIFIED VETERAN WAS THEREFORE WHAT NOW OFFERED ITSELF TO MISSUS STRINGHAM
2514-149482-0036 HER COMPANION AT THE LAST MOMENT HAD BEEN INDISPOSED POSITIVELY NOT WELL ENOUGH AND SO HAD PACKED HER OFF INSISTENTLY WITH EXCUSES WITH WILD REGRETS
2514-149482-0037 THIS CIRCUMSTANCE OF THEIR CHARMING FRIEND'S ILLNESS WAS THE FIRST THING KATE TOOK UP WITH DENSHER ON THEIR BEING ABLE AFTER DINNER
2514-149482-0038 NATURALLY AS SHE CALLED IT WHICH WASN'T WHAT HE DID TOGETHER BUT IT WAS ALREADY AS IF THE YOUNG MAN HAD BY AN ODD IMPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
2514-149482-0039 MISSUS LOWDER HAD MADE DEAR MILLY THE TOPIC AND IT PROVED ON THE SPOT A TOPIC AS FAMILIAR TO THE ENTHUSIASTIC YOUNGER AS TO THE SAGACIOUS OLDER MAN ANY KNOWLEDGE THEY MIGHT LACK MISSUS LOWDER'S NIECE WAS MOREOVER ALERT TO SUPPLY
2514-149482-0040 WHILE DENSHER HIMSELF WAS FREELY APPEALED TO AS THE MOST PRIVILEGED AFTER ALL OF THE GROUP WASN'T IT HE WHO HAD IN A MANNER INVENTED THE WONDERFUL CREATURE THROUGH HAVING SEEN HER FIRST CAUGHT HER IN HER NATIVE JUNGLE HADN'T HE MORE OR LESS PAVED THE WAY
2514-149482-0041 FOR HER BY HIS PROMPT RECOGNITION OF HER RARITY BY PRECEDING HER IN A FRIENDLY SPIRIT AS HE HAD THE EAR OF SOCIETY WITH A SHARP FLASHLIGHT OR TWO HE MET POOR DENSHER THESE ENQUIRIES AS HE COULD
2514-149482-0042 LISTENING WITH INTEREST YET WITH DISCOMFORT WINCING IN PARTICULAR DRY JOURNALIST AS HE WAS TO FIND IT SEEMINGLY SUPPOSED OF HIM THAT HE HAD PUT HIS PEN OH HIS PEN AT THE SERVICE OF PRIVATE DISTINCTION THE EAR OF SOCIETY
2514-149482-0043 THEY WERE TALKING OR ALMOST AS IF HE HAD PUBLICLY PARAGRAPHED A MODEST YOUNG LADY THEY DREAMT DREAMS IN TRUTH HE APPEARED TO PERCEIVE THAT FAIRLY WAKED HIM UP AND HE SETTLED HIMSELF IN HIS PLACE
2514-149482-0044 BOTH TO RESIST HIS EMBARRASSMENT AND TO CATCH THE FULL REVELATION HIS EMBARRASSMENT CAME NATURALLY FROM THE FACT THAT IF HE COULD CLAIM NO CREDIT FOR MISS THEALE'S SUCCESS SO NEITHER COULD HE GRACEFULLY INSIST ON HIS NOT HAVING BEEN CONCERNED WITH HER
2514-149482-0045 MISSUS LOWDER HAD WONDERS TO TELL OF IT THE TWO WEARERS OF THE WAISTCOAT EITHER WITH SINCERITY OR WITH HYPOCRISY PROFESSED IN THE MATTER AN EQUAL EXPERTNESS AND DENSHER AT LAST SEEMED TO KNOW HIMSELF IN PRESENCE OF A SOCIAL CASE
2514-149482-0046 IT WAS MISSUS STRINGHAM OBVIOUSLY WHOSE TESTIMONY WOULD HAVE BEEN MOST INVOKED HADN'T SHE BEEN AS HER FRIEND'S REPRESENTATIVE RATHER CONFINED TO THE FUNCTION OF INHALING THE INCENSE SO THAT KATE
2514-149482-0047 WHO TREATED HER BEAUTIFULLY SMILING AT HER CHEERING AND CONSOLING HER ACROSS THE TABLE APPEARED BENEVOLENTLY BOTH TO SPEAK AND TO INTERPRET FOR HER KATE SPOKE AS IF SHE WOULDN'T PERHAPS UNDERSTAND THEIR WAY OF APPRECIATING MILLY
2514-149482-0048 BUT WOULD LET THEM NONE THE LESS IN JUSTICE TO THEIR GOOD WILL EXPRESS IT IN THEIR COARSER FASHION DENSHER HIMSELF WASN'T UNCONSCIOUS IN RESPECT TO THIS OF A CERTAIN BROAD BROTHERHOOD WITH MISSUS STRINGHAM WONDERING INDEED WHILE HE FOLLOWED THE TALK HOW
2514-149482-0049 IT MIGHT MOVE AMERICAN NERVES HE HAD ONLY HEARD OF THEM BEFORE BUT IN HIS RECENT TOUR HE HAD CAUGHT THEM IN THE REMARKABLE FACT AND THERE WAS NOW A MOMENT OR TWO WHEN IT CAME TO HIM THAT HE HAD PERHAPS AND NOT IN THE WAY OF AN ESCAPE
2514-149482-0050 TAKEN A LESSON FROM THEM THEY QUIVERED CLEARLY THEY HUMMED AND DRUMMED THEY LEAPED AND BOUNDED IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S TYPICAL ORGANISM THIS LADY STRIKING HIM AS BEFORE ALL THINGS EXCITED AS IN THE NATIVE PHRASE KEYED UP
2514-149482-0051 TO A PERCEPTION OF MORE ELEMENTS IN THE OCCASION THAN HE WAS HIMSELF ABLE TO COUNT SHE WAS ACCESSIBLE TO SIDES OF IT HE IMAGINED THAT WERE AS YET OBSCURE TO HIM FOR THOUGH SHE UNMISTAKEABLY REJOICED AND SOARED
2514-149482-0052 HER LITTLE DRY NEW ENGLAND BRIGHTNESS HE HAD SAMPLED ALL THE SHADES OF THE AMERICAN COMPLEXITY IF COMPLEXITY IT WERE HAD ITS ACTUAL REASONS FOR FINDING RELIEF MOST IN SILENCE
2514-149482-0053 SO THAT BEFORE THE SUBJECT WAS CHANGED HE PERCEIVED WITH SURPRISE AT THE OTHERS THAT THEY HAD GIVEN HER ENOUGH OF IT
2514-149482-0054 HAD REALLY NOT MADE IN HER OWN COUNTRY THE MARK SHE HAD CHALKED SO LARGE IN LONDON
2514-149482-0055 WHILE HE SCARCE KNEW IF HE WERE THE MORE IMPRESSED WITH HER LAUNCHING IT UNDER MISSUS STRINGHAM'S NOSE OR WITH HER HOPE THAT HE WOULD ALLOW TO LONDON THE HONOUR OF DISCOVERY THE LESS EXPANSIVE OF THE WHITE WAISTCOATS PROPOUNDED THE THEORY THAT THEY SAW IN LONDON
2514-149482-0056 FOR ALL THAT WAS SAID MUCH FURTHER THAN IN THE STATES IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME HE URGED THAT THEY HAD TAUGHT THE AMERICANS TO APPRECIATE ESPECIALLY WHEN IT WAS FUNNY SOME NATIVE PRODUCT
2514-149482-0057 BUT IT MIGHT VERY WELL BE THAT NEW YORK IN HAVING HER TO SHOW HADN'T BEEN AWARE OF ITS LUCK THERE WERE PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOTHING OVER THERE AND YET WERE AWFULLY TAKEN UP IN ENGLAND JUST AS TO MAKE THE BALANCE RIGHT THANK GOODNESS
2514-149482-0058 THEY SOMETIMES SENT OUT BEAUTIES AND CELEBRITIES WHO LEFT THE BRITON COLD THE BRITON'S TEMPERATURE IN TRUTH WASN'T TO BE CALCULATED A FORMULATION OF THE MATTER THAT WAS NOT REACHED
2514-149482-0059 SHE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THE POINT OF VIEW FOR A PROPER ADMIRATION OF HER YOUNG FRIEND HAD SEEMED TO FAIL A LITTLE IN NEW YORK THERE WAS NO MANNER OF DOUBT OF HER HAVING CARRIED BOSTON BY STORM
2514-149482-0060 IT POINTED THE MORAL THAT BOSTON FOR THE FINER TASTE LEFT NEW YORK NOWHERE AND THE GOOD LADY AS THE EXPONENT OF THIS DOCTRINE WHICH SHE SET FORTH AT A CERTAIN LENGTH MADE OBVIOUSLY TO DENSHER'S MIND HER NEAREST APPROACH TO SUPPLYING
2514-149482-0061 THE WEIRDNESS IN WHICH MILLY'S ABSENCE HAD LEFT THEM DEFICIENT SHE MADE IT INDEED EFFECTIVE FOR HIM BY SUDDENLY ADDRESSING HIM YOU KNOW NOTHING SIR BUT NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY FRIEND
2514-149482-0062 HE HADN'T PRETENDED HE DID BUT THERE WAS A PURITY OF REPROACH IN MISSUS STRINGHAM'S FACE AND TONE A PURITY CHARGED APPARENTLY WITH SOLEMN MEANINGS SO THAT FOR A LITTLE SMALL AS HAD BEEN HIS CLAIM HE COULDN'T BUT FEEL THAT SHE EXAGGERATED
2514-149482-0063 BUT WHILE DOING SO HE DEFENDED HIMSELF I CERTAINLY DON'T KNOW ENORMOUSLY MUCH BEYOND HER HAVING BEEN MOST KIND TO ME IN NEW YORK AS A POOR BEWILDERED AND NEWLY LANDED ALIEN
2514-149482-0064 AND MY HAVING TREMENDOUSLY APPRECIATED IT TO WHICH HE ADDED HE SCARCE KNEW WHY WHAT HAD AN IMMEDIATE SUCCESS REMEMBER MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT YOU WEREN'T THEN PRESENT AH THERE YOU ARE SAID KATE WITH MUCH GAY EXPRESSION
2514-149482-0065 THOUGH WHAT IT EXPRESSED HE FAILED AT THE TIME TO MAKE OUT YOU WEREN'T PRESENT THEN DEAREST MISSUS LOWDER RICHLY CONCURRED YOU DON'T KNOW SHE CONTINUED WITH MELLOW GAIETY HOW FAR THINGS MAY HAVE GONE
2514-149482-0066 IT MADE THE LITTLE WOMAN HE COULD SEE REALLY LOSE HER HEAD SHE HAD MORE THINGS IN THAT HEAD THAN ANY OF THEM IN ANY OTHER UNLESS PERHAPS IT WERE KATE WHOM HE FELT AS INDIRECTLY WATCHING HIM DURING THIS FOOLISH PASSAGE
2514-149482-0067 AND BECAUSE OF THE FOOLISHNESS NOT TO MEET HER EYES HE MET MISSUS STRINGHAM'S WHICH AFFECTED HIM WITH HER HE COULD ON OCCASION CLEAR IT UP A SENSE PRODUCED BY THE MUTE COMMUNION BETWEEN THEM AND
2514-149482-0068 REALLY THE BEGINNING AS THE EVENT WAS TO SHOW OF SOMETHING EXTRAORDINARY IT WAS EVEN ALREADY A LITTLE THE EFFECT OF THIS COMMUNION THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM PERCEPTIBLY FALTERED IN HER RETORT TO MISSUS LOWDER'S JOKE
2514-149482-0069 OH IT'S PRECISELY MY POINT THAT MISTER DENSHER CAN'T HAVE HAD VAST OPPORTUNITIES AND THEN SHE SMILED AT HIM I WASN'T AWAY YOU KNOW LONG IT MADE EVERYTHING IN THE ODDEST WAY IN THE WORLD IMMEDIATELY RIGHT FOR HIM
2514-149482-0070 AND I WASN'T THERE LONG EITHER HE POSITIVELY SAW WITH IT THAT NOTHING FOR HIM SO FAR AS SHE WAS CONCERNED WOULD AGAIN BE WRONG SHE'S BEAUTIFUL BUT I DON'T SAY SHE'S EASY TO KNOW
2514-149482-0071 AS IF NOW TO KEEP WELL WITH HIM HE ASKED NOTHING BETTER SHE WAS OFF WITH YOU TO THESE PARTS BEFORE I KNEW IT I MYSELF WAS OFF TOO AWAY OFF TO WONDERFUL PARTS WHERE I HAD ENDLESSLY MORE TO SEE
2514-149482-0072 BUT YOU DIDN'T FORGET HER AUNT MAUD INTERPOSED WITH ALMOST MENACING ARCHNESS
2514-149482-0073 SHE'LL THANK YOU FOR THAT SIR SAID MISSUS STRINGHAM WITH A FLUSHED FIRMNESS YET DOESN'T SILENCE IN SUCH A CASE AUNT MAUD BLANDLY ENQUIRED VERY OFTEN QUITE PROVE THE DEPTH OF THE IMPRESSION
2514-149482-0074 HE WOULD HAVE BEEN AMUSED HADN'T HE BEEN SLIGHTLY DISPLEASED AT ALL THEY SEEMED DESIROUS TO FASTEN ON HIM WELL THE IMPRESSION WAS AS DEEP AS YOU LIKE BUT I REALLY WANT MISS THEALE TO KNOW HE PURSUED FOR MISSUS STRINGHAM THAT I DON'T FIGURE BY ANY CONSENT OF MY OWN
2514-149482-0075 KATE CAME TO HIS ASSISTANCE IF ASSISTANCE IT WAS BEFORE THEIR FRIEND HAD HAD TIME TO MEET THIS CHARGE YOU'RE RIGHT ABOUT HER NOT BEING EASY TO KNOW ONE SEES HER WITH INTENSITY SEES HER MORE THAN ONE SEES ALMOST ANY ONE BUT THEN ONE DISCOVERS
2514-149482-0076 THAT THAT ISN'T KNOWING HER AND THAT ONE MAY KNOW BETTER A PERSON WHOM ONE DOESN'T SEE AS I SAY HALF SO MUCH THE DISCRIMINATION WAS INTERESTING BUT IT BROUGHT THEM BACK TO THE FACT OF HER SUCCESS AND IT WAS AT THAT COMPARATIVELY GROSS CIRCUMSTANCE
2514-149482-0077 NOW SO FULLY PLACED BEFORE THEM THAT MILLY'S ANXIOUS COMPANION SAT AND LOOKED LOOKED VERY MUCH AS SOME SPECTATOR IN AN OLD TIME CIRCUS MIGHT HAVE WATCHED THE ODDITY OF A CHRISTIAN MAIDEN IN THE ARENA MILDLY CARESSINGLY MARTYRED
2514-149482-0078 IT WAS THE NOSING AND FUMBLING NOT OF LIONS AND TIGERS BUT OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS LET LOOSE AS FOR THE JOKE EVEN THE JOKE MADE MISSUS STRINGHAM UNEASY AND HER MUTE COMMUNION WITH DENSHER TO WHICH WE HAVE ALLUDED
2514-149482-0079 HE WONDERED AFTERWARDS IF KATE HAD MADE THIS OUT THOUGH IT WAS NOT INDEED TILL MUCH LATER ON THAT HE FOUND HIMSELF IN THOUGHT DIVIDING THE THINGS SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSCIOUS OF FROM THE THINGS SHE MUST HAVE MISSED
2514-149482-0080 IF SHE ACTUALLY MISSED AT ANY RATE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S DISCOMFORT THAT BUT SHOWED HOW HER OWN IDEA HELD HER HER OWN IDEA WAS BY INSISTING ON THE FACT OF THE GIRL'S PROMINENCE AS A FEATURE OF THE SEASON'S END
2514-149482-0081 TO KEEP DENSHER IN RELATION FOR THE REST OF THEM BOTH TO PRESENT AND TO PAST IT'S EVERYTHING THAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE THAT MAKES YOU NATURALLY A LITTLE SHY ABOUT HER YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT HAS HAPPENED SINCE BUT WE DO WE'VE SEEN IT AND FOLLOWED IT
2514-149482-0082 WE'VE A LITTLE BEEN OF IT THE GREAT THING FOR HIM AT THIS AS KATE GAVE IT WAS IN FACT QUITE IRRESISTIBLY THAT THE CASE WAS A REAL ONE THE KIND OF THING THAT WHEN ONE'S PATIENCE WAS SHORTER THAN ONE'S CURIOSITY
2514-149482-0083 ONE HAD VAGUELY TAKEN FOR POSSIBLE IN LONDON BUT IN WHICH ONE HAD NEVER BEEN EVEN TO THIS SMALL EXTENT CONCERNED THE LITTLE AMERICAN'S SUDDEN SOCIAL ADVENTURE HER HAPPY AND NO DOUBT HARMLESS FLOURISH
2514-149482-0084 HAD PROBABLY BEEN FAVOURED BY SEVERAL ACCIDENTS BUT IT HAD BEEN FAVOURED ABOVE ALL BY THE SIMPLE SPRING BOARD OF THE SCENE BY ONE OF THOSE COMMON CAPRICES OF THE NUMBERLESS FOOLISH FLOCK GREGARIOUS MOVEMENTS AS INSCRUTABLE
2514-149482-0085 AS OCEAN CURRENTS THE HUDDLED HERD HAD DRIFTED TO HER BLINDLY IT MIGHT AS BLINDLY HAVE DRIFTED AWAY
2514-149482-0086 BUT THE GREAT REASON WAS PROBABLY THE ABSENCE AT THE MOMENT OF A LARGER LION THE BIGGER BEAST WOULD COME AND THE SMALLER WOULD THEN INCONTINENTLY VANISH IT WAS AT ALL EVENTS CHARACTERISTIC
2514-149482-0087 AND WHAT WAS OF THE ESSENCE OF IT WAS GRIST TO HIS SCRIBBLING MILL MATTER FOR HIS JOURNALISING HAND THAT HAND ALREADY IN INTENTION PLAYED OVER IT THE MOTIVE AS A SIGN OF THE SEASON A FEATURE OF THE TIME OF THE PURELY EXPEDITIOUS
2514-149482-0088 AND ROUGH AND TUMBLE NATURE OF THE SOCIAL BOOM THE BOOM AS IN ITSELF REQUIRED THAT WOULD BE THE NOTE THE SUBJECT OF THE PROCESS A COMPARATIVELY MINOR QUESTION ANYTHING WAS BOOMABLE ENOUGH WHEN NOTHING ELSE WAS MORE SO
2514-149482-0089 THE AUTHOR OF THE ROTTEN BOOK THE BEAUTY WHO WAS NO BEAUTY THE HEIRESS WHO WAS ONLY THAT THE STRANGER WHO WAS FOR THE MOST PART SAVED FROM BEING INCONVENIENTLY STRANGE BUT BY BEING INCONVENIENTLY FAMILIAR
2514-149482-0090 THE CREATURE IN FINE AS TO WHOM SPANGLES OR SPOTS OF ANY SUFFICIENTLY MARKED AND EXHIBITED SORT COULD BE LOUDLY ENOUGH PREDICATED
2514-149482-0091 AND THE TONE OF SOCIETY WENT SO FAR AS TO MAKE HIM TAKE UP AGAIN HIS SENSE OF INDEPENDENCE HE HAD SUPPOSED HIMSELF CIVILISED BUT IF THIS WAS CIVILISATION ONE COULD SMOKE ONE'S PIPE OUTSIDE WHEN TWADDLE WAS WITHIN
2514-149482-0092 HE HAD RATHER AVOIDED AS WE HAVE REMARKED KATE'S EYES BUT THERE CAME A MOMENT WHEN HE WOULD FAIRLY HAVE LIKED TO PUT IT ACROSS THE TABLE TO HER I SAY LIGHT OF MY LIFE IS THIS THE GREAT WORLD
2514-149482-0093 THERE CAME ANOTHER IT MUST BE ADDED AND DOUBTLESS AS A RESULT OF SOMETHING THAT OVER THE CLOTH DID HANG BETWEEN THEM WHEN SHE STRUCK HIM AS HAVING QUITE ANSWERED DEAR NO FOR WHAT DO YOU TAKE ME
2514-149482-0094 NOT THE LEAST LITTLE BIT ONLY A POOR SILLY THOUGH QUITE HARMLESS IMITATION WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE PASSED FOR SAYING HOWEVER WAS PRACTICALLY MERGED IN WHAT SHE DID SAY FOR SHE CAME OVERTLY TO HIS AID VERY MUCH AS IF GUESSING SOME OF HIS THOUGHTS
2514-149482-0095 SHE ENUNCIATED TO RELIEVE HIS BEWILDERMENT THE OBVIOUS TRUTH THAT YOU COULDN'T LEAVE LONDON FOR THREE MONTHS AT THAT TIME OF THE YEAR AND COME BACK TO FIND YOUR FRIENDS JUST WHERE THEY WERE AS THEY HAD OF COURSE BEEN JIGGING AWAY
2514-149482-0096 THEY MIGHT WELL BE SO RED IN THE FACE THAT YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THEM SHE RECONCILED IN FINE HIS DISCLAIMER ABOUT MILLY WITH THAT HONOUR OF HAVING DISCOVERED HER WHICH IT WAS VAIN FOR HIM MODESTLY TO SHIRK HE HAD UNEARTHED HER
2514-149482-0097 BUT IT WAS THEY ALL OF THEM TOGETHER WHO HAD DEVELOPED HER SHE WAS ALWAYS A CHARMER ONE OF THE GREATEST EVER SEEN BUT SHE WASN'T THE PERSON HE HAD BACKED
2514-149482-0098 DENSHER WAS TO FEEL SURE AFTERWARDS THAT KATE HAD HAD IN THESE PLEASANTRIES NO CONSCIOUS ABOVE ALL NO INSOLENT PURPOSE OF MAKING LIGHT OF POOR SUSAN SHEPHERD'S PROPERTY IN THEIR YOUNG FRIEND WHICH PROPERTY BY SUCH REMARKS
2514-149482-0099 WAS VERY MUCH PUSHED TO THE WALL BUT HE WAS ALSO TO KNOW THAT MISSUS STRINGHAM HAD SECRETLY RESENTED THEM MISSUS STRINGHAM HOLDING THE OPINION OF WHICH HE WAS ULTIMATELY TO HAVE A GLIMPSE THAT ALL THE KATE CROYS IN CHRISTENDOM WERE BUT DUST FOR THE FEET OF HER MILLY
2514-149482-0100 THAT IT WAS TRUE WOULD BE WHAT SHE MUST REVEAL ONLY WHEN DRIVEN TO HER LAST ENTRENCHMENTS AND WELL CORNERED IN HER PASSION THE RARE PASSION OF FRIENDSHIP THE SOLE PASSION OF HER LITTLE LIFE SAVE THE ONE OTHER MORE IMPERTURBABLY CEREBRAL
2514-149482-0101 SHE SLIPPED IN THE OBSERVATION THAT HER MILLY WAS INCAPABLE OF CHANGE WAS JUST EXACTLY ON THE CONTRARY
2514-149482-0102 SHE WAS PERFECTLY KIND TO SUSIE IT WAS AS IF SHE POSITIVELY KNEW HER AS HANDICAPPED FOR ANY DISAGREEMENT BY FEELING THAT SHE KATE HAD TYPE AND BY BEING COMMITTED TO ADMIRATION OF TYPE
2514-149482-0103 KATE HAD OCCASION SUBSEQUENTLY SHE FOUND IT SOMEHOW TO MENTION TO OUR YOUNG MAN MILLY'S HAVING SPOKEN TO HER OF THIS VIEW ON THE GOOD LADY'S PART SHE WOULD LIKE MILLY HAD HAD IT FROM HER TO PUT KATE CROY IN A BOOK AND SEE WHAT SHE COULD SO DO WITH HER
2514-149482-0104 CHOP ME UP FINE OR SERVE ME WHOLE IT WAS A WAY OF BEING GOT AT THAT KATE PROFESSED SHE DREADED IT WOULD BE MISSUS STRINGHAM'S HOWEVER SHE UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE MISSUS STRINGHAM ODDLY FELT
2514-149482-0105 THAT WITH SUCH STUFF AS THE STRANGE ENGLISH GIRL WAS MADE OF STUFF THAT IN SPITE OF MAUD MANNINGHAM WHO WAS FULL OF SENTIMENT SHE HAD NEVER KNOWN THERE WAS NONE OTHER TO BE EMPLOYED THESE THINGS WERE OF LATER EVIDENCE
2514-149482-0106 YET DENSHER MIGHT EVEN THEN HAVE FELT THEM IN THE AIR THEY WERE PRACTICALLY IN IT ALREADY WHEN KATE WAIVING THE QUESTION OF HER FRIEND'S CHEMICAL CHANGE WOUND UP WITH THE COMPARATIVELY UNOBJECTIONABLE PROPOSITION THAT HE MUST NOW HAVING MISSED SO MUCH
2514-149482-0107 TAKE THEM ALL UP ON TRUST FURTHER ON HE MET IT PEACEFULLY A LITTLE PERHAPS AS AN EXAMPLE TO MISSUS STRINGHAM OH AS FAR ON AS YOU LIKE THIS EVEN HAD ITS EFFECT MISSUS STRINGHAM APPROPRIATED AS MUCH OF IT AS MIGHT BE MEANT FOR HERSELF
2518-154825-0000 HOW FEARFUL AND DIZZY TIS TO CAST ONE'S EYES SO LOW I'LL LOOK NO MORE
2518-154825-0001 SHAKESPEARE THE WHILE CHALK WAS A BULWARK BETWEEN US AND THE FOE AND THOUGH ONE OR TWO OF THEM LOOSED OFF THEIR MATCHLOCKS TRYING TO GET AT US SIDEWAYS THEY COULD NOT EVEN SEE THEIR QUARRY
2518-154825-0002 AND TWAS ONLY SHOOTING AT A VENTURE WE WERE SAFE BUT FOR HOW SHORT A TIME SAFE JUST FOR SO LONG AS IT SHOULD PLEASE THE SOLDIERS NOT TO COME DOWN TO TAKE US
2518-154825-0003 SAFE WITH A DISCHARGED PISTOL IN OUR GRASP AND A SHOT MAN LYING AT OUR FEET ELZEVIR WAS THE FIRST TO SPEAK CAN YOU STAND JOHN IS THE BONE BROKEN
2518-154825-0004 I CANNOT STAND I SAID THERE IS SOMETHING GONE IN MY LEG AND I FEEL BLOOD RUNNING DOWN INTO MY BOOT HE KNELT AND ROLLED DOWN THE LEG OF MY STOCKING BUT THOUGH HE ONLY MOVED MY FOOT
2518-154825-0005 EVER SO LITTLE IT CAUSED ME SHARP PAIN FOR FEELING WAS COMING BACK AFTER THE FIRST NUMBNESS OF THE SHOT THEY HAVE BROKE THE LEG THOUGH IT BLEEDS LITTLE ELZEVIR SAID WE HAVE NO TIME TO SPLICE IT HERE
2518-154825-0006 BUT I WILL PUT A KERCHIEF ROUND AND WHILE I WRAP IT LISTEN TO HOW WE LIE AND THEN CHOOSE WHAT WE SHALL DO I NODDED BITING MY LIPS HARD TO CONCEAL THE PAIN HE GAVE ME AND HE WENT ON
2518-154825-0007 WE HAVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE POSSE CAN GET DOWN TO US BUT COME THEY WILL AND THOU CANST JUDGE WHAT CHANCE WE HAVE TO SAVE LIBERTY
2518-154825-0008 AND HE JERKED HIS THUMB AT MASKEW
2518-154825-0009 AND THEREFORE DO NOT BLAME THEE IF THOU DIDST MAKE ME WASTE A CHARGE IN AIR SO ONE THING WE CAN DO IS TO WAIT HERE UNTIL THEY COME AND I CAN ACCOUNT FOR A FEW OF THEM BEFORE THEY SHOOT ME DOWN BUT THOU CANST NOT FIGHT WITH A BROKEN LEG
2518-154825-0010 AND THEY WILL TAKE THEE ALIVE AND THEN THERE IS A DANCE ON AIR AT DORCHESTER JAIL I FELT SICK WITH PAIN AND BITTERLY CAST DOWN TO THINK THAT I WAS LIKE TO COME SO SOON TO SUCH A VILE END
2518-154825-0011 SO ONLY GAVE A SIGH WISHING HEARTILY THAT MASKEW WERE NOT DEAD AND THAT MY LEG WERE NOT BROKE BUT THAT I WAS BACK AGAIN AT THE WHY NOT OR EVEN HEARING ONE OF DOCTOR SHERLOCK'S SERMONS IN MY AUNT'S PARLOUR
2518-154825-0012 THERE IS YET ANOTHER WAY THAT WE MAY TRY AND IF THOU HADST BUT TWO WHOLE LEGS I WOULD HAVE TRIED IT BUT NOW TIS LITTLE SHORT OF MADNESS AND YET IF THOU FEAR'ST NOT I WILL STILL TRY IT
2518-154825-0013 JUST AT THE END OF THIS FLAT LEDGE FARTHEST FROM WHERE THE BRIDLE PATH LEADS DOWN BUT NOT A HUNDRED YARDS FROM WHERE WE STAND THERE IS A SHEEP TRACK LEADING UP THE CLIFF IT STARTS
2518-154825-0014 WHERE THE UNDER CLIFF DIES BACK AGAIN INTO THE CHALK FACE AND CLIMBS BY SLANTS AND ELBOW TURNS UP TO THE TOP THE SHEPHERDS CALL IT THE ZIGZAG AND EVEN SHEEP LOSE THEIR FOOTING ON IT AND OF MEN
2518-154825-0015 I NEVER HEARD BUT ONE HAD CLIMBED IT AND THAT WAS LANDER JORDAN WHEN THE EXCISE WAS ON HIS HEELS HALF A CENTURY BACK BUT HE THAT TRIES IT STAKES ALL ON HEAD AND FOOT AND A WOUNDED BIRD LIKE THEE MAY NOT DARE THAT FLIGHT
2518-154825-0016 YET IF THOU ART CONTENT TO HANG THY LIFE UPON A HAIR I WILL CARRY THEE SOME WAY AND WHERE THERE IS NO ROOM TO CARRY
2518-154825-0017 IT WAS A DESPERATE CHANCE ENOUGH BUT CAME AS WELCOME AS A PATCH OF BLUE THROUGH LOWERING SKIES YES I SAID DEAR MASTER ELZEVIR LET US GET TO IT QUICKLY AND IF WE FALL
2518-154825-0018 TIS BETTER FAR TO DIE UPON THE ROCKS BELOW THAN TO WAIT HERE FOR THEM TO HALE US OFF TO JAIL AND WITH THAT I TRIED TO STAND THINKING I MIGHT GO DOT AND CARRY EVEN WITH A BROKEN LEG
2518-154825-0019 AND A THREAD OF BLOOD THAT WELLED UP FROM IT AND TRICKLED OFF ON TO THE SWARD IT WAS A SIGHT TO STAGGER ANY MAN AND WOULD HAVE MADE ME SWOON PERHAPS BUT THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR WE WERE AT THE END OF THE UNDER CLIFF
2518-154825-0020 AND TWAS A TASK THAT MIGHT COW THE BRAVEST AND WHEN I LOOKED UPON THE ZIGZAG IT SEEMED BETTER TO STAY WHERE WE WERE AND FALL INTO THE HANDS OF THE POSSE THAN SET FOOT ON THAT AWFUL WAY AND FALL UPON THE ROCKS BELOW
2518-154825-0021 FOR THE ZIGZAG STARTED OFF AS A FAIR ENOUGH CHALK PATH BUT IN A FEW PACES NARROWED DOWN TILL IT WAS BUT A WHITER THREAD AGAINST THE GREY WHITE CLIFF FACE
2518-154825-0022 FAUGH SAID ELZEVIR TIS A POOR BEAST HAS LOST HIS FOOTHOLD IT WAS AN ILL OMEN ENOUGH AND I SAID AS MUCH BESEECHING HIM TO MAKE HIS OWN WAY UP THE ZIGZAG
2518-154825-0023 AND LEAVE ME WHERE I WAS FOR THAT THEY MIGHT HAVE MERCY ON A BOY TUSH HE CRIED IT IS THY HEART THAT FAILS THEE AND TIS TOO LATE NOW TO CHANGE COUNSEL
2518-154825-0024 WE HAVE FIFTEEN MINUTES YET TO WIN OR LOSE WITH AND IF WE GAIN THE CLIFF TOP IN THAT TIME WE SHALL HAVE AN HOUR'S START OR MORE FOR THEY WILL TAKE ALL THAT TO SEARCH THE UNDER CLIFF AND MASKEW TOO
2518-154825-0025 WILL KEEP THEM IN CHECK A LITTLE WHILE THEY TRY TO BRING THE LIFE BACK TO SO GOOD A MAN BUT IF WE FALL WHY WE SHALL FALL TOGETHER AND OUTWIT THEIR CUNNING
2518-154825-0026 SO SHUT THY EYES AND KEEP THEM TIGHT UNTIL I BID THEE OPEN THEM WITH THAT HE CAUGHT ME UP AGAIN AND I SHUT MY EYES FIRM REBUKING MYSELF FOR MY FAINT HEARTEDNESS AND NOT TELLING HIM HOW MUCH MY FOOT HURT ME
2518-154825-0027 IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM ELZEVIR'S STEPS THAT HE HAD LEFT THE TURF AND WAS UPON THE CHALK NOW I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE WERE HALF A DOZEN MEN BESIDE IN ENGLAND WHO WOULD HAVE VENTURED UP THAT PATH EVEN FREE AND UNTRAMMELLED
2518-154825-0028 AND NOT A MAN IN ALL THE WORLD TO DO IT WITH A FULL GROWN LAD IN HIS ARMS YET ELZEVIR MADE NO BONES OF IT NOR SPOKE A SINGLE WORD ONLY HE WENT VERY SLOW AND I FELT HIM SCUFFLE WITH HIS FOOT
2518-154825-0029 THUS HE WENT ON FOR A TIME THAT SEEMED WITHOUT END AND YET WAS REALLY BUT A MINUTE OR TWO AND BY DEGREES I FELT THE WIND THAT WE COULD SCARCE PERCEIVE AT ALL ON THE UNDER CLIFF BLOW FRESHER AND COLD ON THE CLIFF SIDE
2518-154825-0030 AND THEN THE PATH GREW STEEPER AND STEEPER AND ELZEVIR WENT SLOWER AND SLOWER TILL AT LAST HE SPOKE JOHN I AM GOING TO STOP
2518-154825-0031 BUT OPEN NOT THY EYES TILL I HAVE SET THEE DOWN AND BID THEE I DID AS BIDDEN AND HE LOWERED ME GENTLY SETTING ME ON ALL FOURS UPON THE PATH AND SPEAKING AGAIN
2518-154825-0032 THE PATH IS TOO NARROW HERE FOR ME TO CARRY THEE AND THOU MUST CREEP ROUND THIS CORNER ON THY HANDS AND KNEES BUT HAVE A CARE TO KEEP THY OUTER HAND NEAR TO THE INNER AND THE BALANCE OF THY BODY TO THE CLIFF
2518-154825-0033 FOR THERE IS NO ROOM TO DANCE HORNPIPES HERE AND HOLD THY EYES FIXED ON THE CHALK WALL LOOKING NEITHER DOWN NOR SEAWARD TWAS WELL HE TOLD ME WHAT TO DO AND WELL I DID IT
2518-154825-0034 BUT SPENT MUCH TIME THAT WAS SO PRECIOUS IN TRAVELLING THOSE TEN YARDS TO TAKE ME ROUND THE FIRST ELBOW OF THE PATH FOR MY FOOT WAS HEAVY AND GAVE ME FIERCE PAIN TO DRAG THOUGH I TRIED TO MASK IT FROM ELZEVIR AND HE
2518-154825-0035 FORGETTING WHAT I SUFFERED CRIED OUT QUICKEN THY PACE LAD IF THOU CANST THE TIME IS SHORT NOW SO FRAIL IS MAN'S TEMPER THAT THOUGH HE WAS DOING MORE THAN ANY EVER DID TO SAVE ANOTHER'S LIFE AND WAS ALL I HAD TO TRUST TO IN THE WORLD YET
2518-154825-0036 BUT HERE WAS ANOTHER DIFFICULTY FOR THE PATH WAS STILL SO NARROW AND THE CLIFF WALL SO CLOSE THAT HE COULD NOT TAKE ME UP IN HIS ARMS SO I LAY FLAT ON MY FACE AND HE STEPPED OVER ME SETTING HIS FOOT BETWEEN MY SHOULDERS TO DO IT
2518-154825-0037 AND THEN WHILE HE KNELT DOWN UPON THE PATH
2518-154825-0038 PUTTING MY ARMS ROUND HIS NECK AND SO HE BORE ME PICKABACK I SHUT MY EYES FIRM AGAIN AND THUS WE MOVED ALONG ANOTHER SPELL MOUNTING STILL AND FEELING THE WIND STILL FRESHENING
2518-154825-0039 BOTH WERE ON ALL FOURS NOW ELZEVIR FIRST AND I FOLLOWING BUT AS I CREPT ALONG I RELAXED CARE FOR A MOMENT AND MY EYES WANDERED FROM THE CLIFF SIDE AND LOOKED DOWN AND FAR BELOW
2518-154825-0040 I SAW THE BLUE SEA TWINKLING LIKE A DAZZLING MIRROR AND THE GULLS WHEELING ABOUT THE SHEER CHALK WALL AND THEN I THOUGHT OF THAT BLOATED CARCASS OF A SHEEP THAT HAD FALLEN FROM THIS VERY SPOT PERHAPS AND IN AN INSTANT
2518-154825-0041 FELT A SICKENING QUALM AND SWIMMING OF THE BRAIN AND KNEW THAT I WAS GIDDY AND MUST FALL THEN I CALLED OUT TO ELZEVIR AND HE GUESSING WHAT HAD COME OVER ME CRIES TO TURN UPON MY SIDE AND PRESS MY BELLY TO THE CLIFF
2518-154825-0042 AND HOW HE DID IT IN SUCH A NARROW STRAIT I KNOW NOT BUT HE TURNED ROUND AND LYING DOWN HIMSELF THRUST HIS HAND FIRMLY IN MY BACK PRESSING ME CLOSER TO THE CLIFF YET IT WAS NONE TOO SOON FOR IF HE HAD NOT HELD ME TIGHT
2518-154825-0043 I SHOULD HAVE FLUNG MYSELF DOWN IN SHEER DESPAIR TO GET QUIT OF THAT DREADFUL SICKNESS KEEP THINE EYES SHUT JOHN HE SAID AND COUNT UP NUMBERS LOUD TO ME THAT I MAY KNOW THOU ART NOT TURNING FAINT
2518-154825-0044 SO I GAVE OUT ONE TWO THREE AND WHILE I WENT ON COUNTING HEARD HIM REPEATING TO HIMSELF THOUGH HIS WORDS SEEMED THIN AND FAR OFF WE MUST HAVE TAKEN TEN MINUTES TO GET HERE
2518-154825-0045 AND IN FIVE MORE THEY WILL BE ON THE UNDER CLIFF AND IF WE EVER REACH THE TOP WHO KNOWS BUT THEY HAVE LEFT A GUARD NO NO THEY WILL NOT LEAVE A GUARD FOR NOT A MAN KNOWS OF THE ZIGZAG AND IF THEY KNEW
2518-154825-0046 LIKE SITTING GUILLEMOTS AGAINST THE CLIFF FACE SO HE TALKED TO HIMSELF AND ALL THE WHILE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN A WORLD TO PLUCK UP HEART AND CREEP ON FARTHER YET COULD NOT FOR THE DEADLY SWEATING FEAR THAT HAD HOLD OF ME
2518-154825-0047 THUS I LAY WITH MY FACE TO THE CLIFF AND ELZEVIR PUSHING FIRMLY IN MY BACK AND THE THING THAT FRIGHTENED ME MOST WAS THAT THERE WAS NOTHING AT ALL FOR THE HAND TO TAKE HOLD OF FOR HAD THERE BEEN A PIECE OF STRING OR EVEN A THREAD OF COTTON
2518-154825-0048 I THINK I COULD HAVE DONE IT BUT THERE WAS ONLY THE CLIFF WALL SHEER AND WHITE AGAINST THAT NARROWEST WAY WITH NEVER CRANNY TO PUT A FINGER INTO THE WIND WAS BLOWING IN FRESH PUFFS AND THOUGH I DID NOT OPEN MY EYES
2518-154825-0049 I KNEW THAT IT WAS MOVING THE LITTLE TUFTS OF BENT GRASS AND THE CHIDING CRIES OF THE GULLS SEEMED TO INVITE ME TO BE DONE WITH FEAR AND PAIN AND BROKEN LEG AND FLING MYSELF OFF ON TO THE ROCKS BELOW THEN ELZEVIR SPOKE JOHN HE SAID
2518-154825-0050 THERE IS NO TIME TO PLAY THE WOMAN ANOTHER MINUTE OF THIS AND WE ARE LOST PLUCK UP THY COURAGE KEEP THY EYES TO THE CLIFF AND FORWARD YET I COULD NOT BUT ANSWERED I CANNOT I CANNOT
2518-154825-0051 MOVE THOU MUST AND TIS BETTER TO RISK FALLING NOW THAN FALL FOR CERTAIN WITH ANOTHER BULLET IN THEE LATER ON AND WITH THAT HE SHIFTED HIS HAND FROM MY BACK AND FIXED IT IN MY COAT COLLAR MOVING BACKWARDS HIMSELF AND SETTING TO DRAG ME AFTER HIM
2518-154825-0052 NOW I WAS SO BESOTTED WITH FRIGHT THAT I WOULD NOT BUDGE AN INCH FEARING TO FALL OVER IF I OPENED MY EYES AND ELZEVIR FOR ALL HE WAS SO STRONG COULD NOT PULL A HELPLESS LUMP BACKWARDS UP THAT PATH
2518-154825-0053 SO HE GAVE IT UP LEAVING GO HOLD ON ME WITH A GROAN AND AT THAT MOMENT THERE ROSE FROM THE UNDER CLIFF BELOW A SOUND OF VOICES AND SHOUTING ZOUNDS THEY ARE DOWN ALREADY CRIED ELZEVIR AND HAVE FOUND MASKEW'S BODY
2518-154825-0054 IT IS ALL UP ANOTHER MINUTE AND THEY WILL SEE US BUT SO STRANGE IS THE FORCE OF MIND ON BODY AND THE POWER OF A GREATER TO MASTER A LESSER FEAR THAT WHEN I HEARD THOSE VOICES FROM BELOW ALL FRIGHT OF FALLING LEFT ME IN A MOMENT
2518-154825-0055 AND I COULD OPEN MY EYES WITHOUT A TRACE OF GIDDINESS SO I BEGAN TO MOVE FORWARD AGAIN ON HANDS AND KNEES AND ELZEVIR
2518-154825-0056 THINKING THAT WE WERE HIDING BY THE SEA FIVE MINUTES LATER ELZEVIR STEPPED ON TO THE CLIFF TOP WITH ME UPON HIS BACK WE HAVE MADE SOMETHING OF THIS THROW HE SAID AND ARE SAFE FOR ANOTHER HOUR THOUGH I THOUGHT THY GIDDY HEAD HAD RUINED US
2518-154826-0000 THE DAY WAS STILL YOUNG AND FAR BELOW US WAS STRETCHED THE MOVING FLOOR OF THE CHANNEL WITH A SILVER GREY FILM OF NIGHT MISTS NOT YET LIFTED IN THE OFFING A HUMMOCKY UP AND DOWN LINE OF CLIFFS
2518-154826-0001 WITH THE STRAIGHT SUNPATH ACROSS IT SPANGLED AND GLEAMING LIKE A MACKEREL'S BACK THE RELIEF OF BEING ONCE MORE ON FIRM GROUND AND THE EXULTATION OF AN ESCAPE FROM IMMEDIATE DANGER REMOVED MY PAIN AND MADE ME FORGET THAT MY LEG WAS BROKEN
2518-154826-0002 AND THE WIND WHICH A FEW MINUTES BEFORE THREATENED TO BLOW ME FROM THAT NARROW LEDGE SEEMED NOW BUT THE GENTLEST OF BREEZES FRESH WITH THE BREATH OF THE KINDLY SEA BUT THIS WAS ONLY FOR A MOMENT FOR THE ANGUISH CAME BACK AND GREW APACE
2518-154826-0003 AND I FELL TO THINKING DISMALLY OF THE PLIGHT WE WERE IN HOW THINGS HAD BEEN AGAINST US IN THESE LAST DAYS FIRST THERE WAS LOSING THE WHY NOT AND THAT WAS BAD ENOUGH SECOND
2518-154826-0004 THERE WAS THE BEING KNOWN BY THE EXCISE FOR SMUGGLERS AND PERHAPS FOR MURDERERS THIRD AND LAST THERE WAS THE BREAKING OF MY LEG WHICH MADE ESCAPE SO DIFFICULT BUT MOST OF ALL
2518-154826-0005 THERE CAME BEFORE MY EYES THAT GREY FACE TURNED UP AGAINST THE MORNING SUN AND I THOUGHT OF ALL IT MEANT FOR GRACE AND WOULD HAVE GIVEN MY OWN LIFE TO CALL BACK THAT OF OUR WORST ENEMY THEN ELZEVIR SAT UP STRETCHING HIMSELF LIKE ONE WAKING OUT OF SLEEP
2518-154826-0006 AND SAID WE MUST BE GONE THEY WILL NOT BE BACK FOR SOME TIME YET AND WHEN THEY COME WILL NOT THINK TO SEARCH CLOSELY FOR US HEREABOUTS BUT THAT WE CANNOT RISK AND MUST GET CLEAR AWAY
2518-154826-0007 THIS LEG OF THINE WILL KEEP US TIED FOR WEEKS AND WE MUST FIND SOME PLACE WHERE WE CAN LIE HID AND TEND IT NOW I KNOW SUCH A HIDING HOLE IN PURBECK WHICH THEY CALL JOSEPH'S PIT AND THITHER WE MUST GO BUT IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DAY TO GET THERE
2518-154826-0008 AND SO HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AGAIN AND STARTED OFF ACROSS THE FIELDS I NEED NOT TELL OF THAT WEARY JOURNEY AND INDEED COULD NOT IF I WISHED FOR THE PAIN WENT TO MY HEAD AND FILLED ME WITH SUCH A DROWSY ANGUISH
2518-154826-0009 THAT I KNEW NOTHING EXCEPT WHEN SOME UNLOOKED FOR MOVEMENT GAVE ME A SHARPER TWINGE AND MADE ME CRY OUT AT FIRST ELZEVIR WALKED BRISKLY BUT AS THE DAY WORE ON WENT SLOWER
2518-154826-0010 IT WAS AFTER NOON FOR THE SUN WAS PAST THE MERIDIAN AND VERY HOT FOR THE TIME OF YEAR WHEN THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY BEGAN TO CHANGE AND INSTEAD OF THE SHORT SWARD OF THE OPEN DOWN SPRINKLED WITH TINY WHITE SNAIL SHELLS
2518-154826-0011 THE GROUND WAS BRASHY WITH FLAT STONES AND DIVIDED UP INTO TILLAGE FIELDS IT WAS A BLEAK WIDE BITTEN PLACE ENOUGH LOOKING AS IF TWOULD NEVER PAY FOR TURNING AND INSTEAD OF HEDGES THERE WERE DREARY WALLS BUILT OF DRY STONE WITHOUT MORTAR
2518-154826-0012 BEHIND ONE OF THESE WALLS BROKEN DOWN IN PLACES BUT HELD TOGETHER WITH STRAGGLING IVY AND BUTTRESSED HERE AND THERE WITH A BRAMBLE BUSH ELZEVIR PUT ME DOWN AT LENGTH AND SAID I AM BEAT AND CAN CARRY THEE NO FARTHER FOR THIS PRESENT
2518-154826-0013 THOUGH THERE IS NOT NOW MUCH FARTHER TO GO WE HAVE PASSED PURBECK GATES AND THESE WALLS WILL SCREEN US FROM PRYING EYES IF ANY CHANCE COMER PASS ALONG THE DOWN AND AS FOR THE SOLDIERS THEY ARE NOT LIKE TO COME THIS WAY SO SOON
2518-154826-0014 AND IF THEY COME I CANNOT HELP IT FOR WEARINESS AND THE SUN'S HEAT HAVE MADE MY FEET LIKE LEAD A SCORE OF YEARS AGO I WOULD HAVE LAUGHED AT SUCH A TASK BUT NOW TIS DIFFERENT
2518-154826-0015 SO SIT THEE HERE AND LEAN THY SHOULDER UP AGAINST THE WALL AND THUS THOU CANST LOOK THROUGH THIS BROKEN PLACE AND WATCH BOTH WAYS THEN IF THOU SEE AUGHT MOVING WAKE ME UP
2518-154826-0016 I WISH I HAD A THIMBLEFUL OF POWDER TO MAKE THIS WHISTLE SOUND' AND HE TOOK MASKEW'S SILVER BUTTED PISTOL AGAIN FROM HIS BOSOM AND HANDLED IT LOVINGLY
2518-154826-0017 WITH THAT HE FLUNG HIMSELF DOWN WHERE THERE WAS A NARROW SHADOW CLOSE AGAINST THE BOTTOM OF THE WALL AND IN A MINUTE I KNEW FROM HIS HEAVY BREATHING THAT HE WAS ASLEEP THE WIND HAD FRESHENED MUCH AND WAS BLOWING STRONG FROM THE WEST
2518-154826-0018 AND NOW THAT I WAS UNDER THE LEE OF THE WALL
2518-154826-0019 AND GETS AT LENGTH INTO SHELTER MOREOVER THOUGH I WAS NOT TIRED BY GRIEVOUS TOIL LIKE ELZEVIR I HAD PASSED A NIGHT WITHOUT SLEEP AND FELT BESIDES THE WEARINESS OF PAIN TO LULL ME TO SLUMBER
2518-154826-0020 THEN I SOUGHT SOMETHING TO FIX MY THOUGHTS AND LOOKING ON THAT SIDE OF THE WALL WHERE THE SWARD WAS FELL TO COUNTING THE MOLE HILLS THAT WERE CAST UP IN NUMBERS THEREABOUT AND WHEN I HAD EXHAUSTED THEM AND RECKONED UP THIRTY LITTLE HEAPS OF DRY AND POWDERY BROWN EARTH
2518-154826-0021 THAT LAY AT RANDOM ON THE GREEN TURF I TURNED MY EYES TO THE TILLAGE FIELD ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL AND SAW THE INCH HIGH BLADES OF CORN COMING UP BETWEEN THE STONES THEN I FELL TO COUNTING THE BLADES FEELING GLAD TO HAVE DISCOVERED A RECKONING THAT WOULD NOT BE EXHAUSTED AT THIRTY
2518-154826-0022 BUT WOULD GO ON FOR MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND MILLIONS AND BEFORE I HAD REACHED TEN IN SO HEROIC A NUMERATION WAS FAST ASLEEP A SHARP NOISE WOKE ME WITH A START THAT SET THE PAIN TINGLING IN MY LEG
2518-154826-0023 AND THOUGH I COULD SEE NOTHING I KNEW THAT A SHOT HAD BEEN FIRED VERY NEAR US I WAS FOR WAKING ELZEVIR BUT HE WAS ALREADY FULL AWAKE AND PUT A FINGER ON HIS LIP TO SHOW I SHOULD NOT SPEAK THEN
2518-154826-0024 ENOUGH FOR HIM TO LOOK THROUGH THE LEAVES WITHOUT BEING SEEN HE DROPPED DOWN AGAIN WITH A LOOK OF RELIEF AND SAID TIS BUT A LAD SCARING ROOKS WITH A BLUNDERBUSS WE WILL NOT STIR UNLESS HE MAKES THIS WAY A MINUTE LATER HE SAID THE BOY IS COMING STRAIGHT FOR THE WALL
2518-154826-0025 WE SHALL HAVE TO SHOW OURSELVES AND WHILE HE SPOKE THERE WAS A RATTLE OF FALLING STONES WHERE THE BOY WAS PARTLY CLIMBING AND PARTLY PULLING DOWN THE DRY WALL AND SO ELZEVIR STOOD UP THE BOY LOOKED FRIGHTENED AND MADE AS IF HE WOULD RUN OFF
2518-154826-0026 BUT ELZEVIR PASSED HIM THE TIME OF DAY IN A CIVIL VOICE AND HE STOPPED AND GAVE IT BACK WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE SON BLOCK ASKED SCARING ROOKS FOR FARMER TOPP WAS THE ANSWER
2518-154826-0027 HAVE YOU GOT A CHARGE OF POWDER TO SPARE SAID ELZEVIR SHOWING HIS PISTOL I WANT TO GET A RABBIT IN THE GORSE FOR SUPPER AND HAVE DROPPED MY FLASK MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN A FLASK IN WALKING THROUGH THE FURROWS HE WHISPERED TO ME TO LIE STILL
2518-154826-0028 NO TIME WAS WASTED IN WORDS ELZEVIR HAD THE FLASK IN HIS POCKET AND THE BOY WAS BITING THE CROWN WHAT SHOT HAVE YOU SAID ELZEVIR WHAT HAVE YOU DROPPED YOUR SHOT FLASK TOO ASKED THE BOY
2518-154826-0029 AND HIS VOICE HAD SOMETHING OF SURPRISE IN IT NAY BUT MY SHOT ARE OVER SMALL
2518-154826-0030 BUT THOU MUST PAY A SHILLING FOR THEM MY MASTER SAYS I NEVER AM TO USE THEM EXCEPT I SEE A SWAN OR BUZZARD OR SOMETHING FIT TO COOK COME OVER I SHALL GET A SOUND BEATING FOR MY PAINS AND TO BE BEAT IS WORTH A SHILLING IF THOU ART BEAT BE BEAT FOR SOMETHING MORE SAYS ELZEVIR THE TEMPTER
2518-154826-0031 THE SMUGGLERS GOT OFF CLEAR BUT THEY SAY THE HUE AND CRY IS UP ALREADY AND THAT A HEAD PRICE WILL BE FIXED OF TWENTY POUND SO IF I SELL YOU A FOWLING PIECE MAYBE I SHALL DO WRONG AND HAVE THE GOVERNMENT UPON ME AS WELL AS MY MASTER THE SURPRISE IN HIS VOICE WAS CHANGED TO SUSPICION
2518-154826-0032 FOR WHILE HE SPOKE I SAW THAT HIS EYE HAD FALLEN ON MY FOOT THOUGH I TRIED TO KEEP IT IN THE SHADOW AND THAT HE SAW THE BOOT CLOTTED WITH BLOOD AND THE KERCHIEF TIED ROUND MY LEG TIS FOR THAT VERY REASON SAYS ELZEVIR THAT I WANT THE FIRELOCK
2518-154826-0033 THESE SMUGGLERS ARE ROAMING LOOSE AND A PISTOL IS A POOR THING TO STOP SUCH WICKED RASCALS ON A LONE HILL SIDE COME COME THOU DOST NOT WANT A PIECE TO GUARD THEE THEY WILL NOT HURT A BOY HE HAD THE GUINEA BETWEEN HIS FINGER AND THUMB
2518-154826-0034 AND SO I SAID AS MUCH TO ELZEVIR WHO ONLY LAUGHED SAYING THE BOY WAS SIMPLE AND HARMLESS BUT FROM WHERE I SAT I COULD PEEP OUT THROUGH THE BRAMBLES IN THE OPEN GAP AND SEE WITHOUT BEING SEEN AND THERE WAS MY YOUNG GENTLEMAN WALKING CARELESSLY ENOUGH
2518-154826-0035 BUT WHEN ELZEVIR SAT DOWN THE BOY GAVE A CAREFUL LOOK ROUND AND SEEING NO ONE WATCHING ANY MORE
2518-154826-0036 THEN I KNEW THAT HE HAD GUESSED WHO WE WERE AND WAS OFF TO WARN THE HUE AND CRY BUT BEFORE ELZEVIR WAS ON HIS FEET AGAIN THE BOY WAS OUT OF SIGHT OVER THE HILL BROW LET US MOVE ON SAID BLOCK TIS BUT A LITTLE DISTANCE NOW TO GO AND THE HEAT IS PAST ALREADY
2518-154826-0037 WE MUST HAVE SLEPT THREE HOURS OR MORE FOR THOU ART BUT A SORRY WATCHMAN JOHN TIS WHEN THE SENTRY SLEEPS THAT THE ENEMY LAUGHS AND FOR THEE THE POSSE MIGHT HAVE HAD US BOTH LIKE DAYLIGHT OWLS WITH THAT HE TOOK ME ON HIS BACK AND MADE OFF WITH A LUSTY STRIDE
2518-154826-0038 AND IN THE SHELTER OF THE WALLS WE HAD SLEPT LONGER THAN WE THOUGHT FOR THE SUN WAS WESTERING FAST AND THOUGH THE REST HAD REFRESHED ME MY LEG HAD GROWN STIFF AND HURT THE MORE IN DANGLING WHEN WE STARTED AGAIN
2518-154826-0039 ELZEVIR WAS STILL WALKING STRONGLY IN SPITE OF THE HEAVY BURDEN HE CARRIED AND IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR I KNEW THOUGH I HAD NEVER BEEN THERE BEFORE WE WERE IN THE LAND OF THE OLD MARBLE QUARRIES AT THE BACK OF ANVIL POINT
2518-154826-0040 ALTHOUGH I KNEW LITTLE OF THESE QUARRIES AND CERTAINLY WAS IN EVIL PLIGHT TO TAKE NOTE OF ANYTHING AT THAT TIME YET AFTERWARDS I LEARNT MUCH ABOUT THEM OUT OF SUCH EXCAVATIONS COMES THAT BLACK PURBECK MARBLE WHICH YOU SEE IN OLD CHURCHES IN OUR COUNTRY
2518-154826-0041 AND I AM TOLD IN OTHER PARTS OF ENGLAND AS WELL AND THE WAY OF MAKING A MARBLE QUARRY IS TO SINK A TUNNEL SLANTING VERY STEEPLY DOWN INTO THE EARTH LIKE A WELL TURNED ASKEW TILL YOU REACH FIFTY SEVENTY OR PERHAPS ONE HUNDRED FEET DEEP THEN
2518-154826-0042 FROM THE BOTTOM OF THIS SHAFT THERE SPREAD OUT NARROW PASSAGES OR TUNNELS MOSTLY SIX FEET HIGH BUT SOMETIMES ONLY THREE OR FOUR AND IN THESE THE MARBLE IS DUG THESE QUARRIES WERE MADE BY MEN CENTURIES AGO SOME SAY BY THE ROMANS THEMSELVES
2518-154826-0043 WHICH WAS JUST PUTTING ON THE BRIGHTER GREEN OF SPRING THIS TURF WAS NOT SMOOTH BUT HUMMOCKY FOR UNDER IT LAY HEAPS OF WORTHLESS STONE AND MARBLE DRAWN OUT OF THE QUARRIES AGES AGO WHICH THE GREEN VESTMENT HAD COVERED FOR THE MOST PART
2518-154826-0044 THOUGH IT LEFT SOMETIMES A LITTLE PATCH OF BROKEN RUBBLE PEERING OUT AT THE TOP OF A MOUND THERE WERE MANY TUMBLE DOWN WALLS AND LOW GABLES LEFT OF THE COTTAGES OF THE OLD QUARRYMEN GRASS COVERED RIDGES MARKED OUT THE LITTLE GARDEN FOLDS
2518-154826-0045 AND HERE AND THERE STILL STOOD A FORLORN GOOSEBERRY BUSH
2518-154826-0046 ON WHICH THE MARBLE BLOCKS WERE ONCE HAULED UP BY WOODEN WINCHES DOWN THESE STEPS NO FEET EVER WALKED NOW FOR NOT ONLY WERE SUFFOCATING GASES SAID TO BESET THE BOTTOM OF THE SHAFTS
2518-154826-0047 FOR IF IT WERE NOT FOR THIS HOLY PURPOSE THE MANDRIVE WOULD HAVE POWER TO STRANGLE THE MAN THAT HEWED IT IT WAS BY THE SIDE OF ONE OF THESE OLD SHAFTS THAT ELZEVIR LAID ME DOWN AT LAST THE LIGHT WAS VERY LOW
2518-154826-0048 AND THE SWARD CREPT OVER THE EDGES OF THE HOLE AND EVERY CRACK AND CREVICE IN STEPS AND SLIDE WAS GREEN WITH FERNS THE GREEN FERNS SHROUDED THE WALLS OF THE HOLE AND RUDDY BROWN BRAMBLES OVERGREW THE STEPS
2518-154826-0049 THERE HE SAID THIS IS JOSEPH'S PIT AND HERE WE MUST LIE HID UNTIL THY FOOT IS SOUND AGAIN ONCE GET TO THE BOTTOM SAFE AND WE CAN LAUGH AT POSSE AND HUE AND CRY
2518-154826-0050 AND BEFORE THEY COME TO WHERE WE LIE WE CAN HOLD THE TROOP AT BAY AND SELL OUR LIVES SO DEAR THEY WILL NOT CARE TO BUY THEM WE WAITED A FEW MINUTES AND THEN HE TOOK ME IN HIS ARMS AND BEGAN TO DESCEND THE STEPS BACK FIRST AS ONE GOES DOWN A HATCHWAY
2518-154826-0051 AND HOW FAR OFF WE WERE NOW AND HOW LONG IT WAS LIKELY TO BE BEFORE I SAW THAT DEAR VILLAGE AND GRACE AGAIN THE STAIRS WERE STILL SHARP CUT AND LITTLE WORN BUT ELZEVIR PAID GREAT CARE TO HIS FEET LEST HE SHOULD SLIP ON THE FERNS AND MOSSES WITH WHICH THEY WERE OVERGROWN
2518-154826-0052 HE SHOVED THEM ASIDE WITH HIS BROAD SHOULDERS AND SCREENED MY DANGLING LEG FROM GETTING CAUGHT THUS HE CAME SAFE WITHOUT STUMBLE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE PIT WHEN WE GOT THERE ALL WAS DARK BUT HE STEPPED OFF INTO A NARROW OPENING ON THE RIGHT HAND
2518-154826-0053 AND WALKED ON AS IF HE KNEW THE WAY I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT PERCEIVED THAT WE WERE PASSING THROUGH ENDLESS GALLERIES CUT IN THE SOLID ROCK HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE MOST PART TO ALLOW OF WALKING UPRIGHT BUT SOMETIMES SO LOW AS TO FORCE HIM TO BEND DOWN
2518-154826-0054 AND CARRY ME IN A VERY CONSTRAINED ATTITUDE ONLY TWICE DID HE SET ME DOWN AT A TURNING WHILE HE TOOK OUT HIS TINDER BOX AND LIT A MATCH
254-12312-0000 POOR MORTALS WHO WAIT FOR A HAPPY DAY CHEER UP YOUR HEARTS
254-12312-0001 IF IT BE LAWFUL FIRMLY TO BELIEVE
254-12312-0002 THOUGH IT BE AT HAND YEA AND BEFORE THERE SHALL APPEAR A RACE OF MEN WHO LOTH TO SIT STILL IN ONE PLACE SHALL BOLDLY GO BEFORE ALL PEOPLE'S EYES SUBORNING MEN OF DIVERS QUALITIES TO DRAW THEM
254-12312-0003 AND CHILDREN THEIR OWN PARENTS IN A WORD ALL REVERENCE SHALL THEN BE BANISHED NO TRUE RESPECT TO OTHER SHALL BE HAD THEY'LL SAY THAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE HIS TURN BOTH IN HIS GOING FORTH AND HIS RETURN
254-12312-0004 SUCH WOES SUCH JARRINGS
254-12312-0005 THAT NEVER WERE IN HISTORY SUCH COILS SET DOWN AS YET SUCH TUMULTS AND GARBOILS
254-12312-0006 WHO TRUSTING TOO MUCH IN THEIR HOPEFUL TIME LIVE BUT A WHILE AND PERISH IN THEIR PRIME NEITHER SHALL ANY WHO THIS COURSE SHALL RUN LEAVE OFF THE RACE WHICH HE HATH ONCE BEGUN
254-12312-0007 THE VERIEST LOUT OF ALL SHALL BE THEIR JUDGE O HORRIBLE AND DANGEROUS DELUGE DELUGE I CALL IT AND THAT FOR GOOD REASON FOR THIS SHALL BE OMITTED IN NO SEASON
254-12312-0008 BECAUSE THEY DID NOT SPARE THE FLOCKS OF BEASTS THAT INNOCENTEST ARE BUT DID THEIR SINEWS AND THEIR BOWELS TAKE NOT TO THE GODS A SACRIFICE TO MAKE BUT USUALLY TO SERVE THEMSELVES FOR SPORT
254-12312-0009 AND NOW CONSIDER I DO YOU EXHORT IN SUCH COMMOTIONS SO CONTINUAL WHAT REST CAN TAKE THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL MOST HAPPY THEN ARE THEY THAT CAN IT HOLD AND USE IT CAREFULLY AS PRECIOUS GOLD
254-12312-0010 BY KEEPING IT IN GAOL WHENCE IT SHALL HAVE NO HELP BUT HIM WHO BEING TO IT GAVE AND TO INCREASE HIS MOURNFUL ACCIDENT
254-12312-0011 SHALL CEASE TO DART UPON IT ANY LIGHT MORE THAN IN AN ECLIPSE OR IN THE NIGHT SO THAT AT ONCE ITS FAVOUR SHALL BE GONE AND LIBERTY WITH IT BE LEFT ALONE AND YET BEFORE IT COME TO RUIN THUS
254-12312-0012 INARIME DID NOT MORE QUICKLY MOVE WHEN TYPHEUS DID THE VAST HUGE HILLS REMOVE AND FOR DESPITE INTO THE SEA THEM THREW THUS SHALL IT THEN BE LOST BY WAYS NOT FEW
254-12312-0013 AND YET BEFORE THAT THEY BE CLEAN DISPERST
254-12312-0014 O HE IS WORTHY PRAISE THAT SHRINKETH NOT NO SOONER WAS THIS ENIGMATICAL MONUMENT READ OVER BUT GARGANTUA FETCHING A VERY DEEP SIGH SAID UNTO THOSE THAT STOOD BY
254-12312-0015 ARE PERSECUTED BUT HAPPY IS THAT MAN THAT SHALL NOT BE SCANDALIZED BUT SHALL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO THE END IN AIMING AT THAT MARK WHICH GOD BY HIS DEAR SON HATH SET BEFORE US
254-12312-0016 WITHOUT BEING DISTRACTED OR DIVERTED BY HIS CARNAL AFFECTIONS AND DEPRAVED NATURE THE MONK THEN SAID WHAT DO YOU THINK IN YOUR CONSCIENCE IS MEANT AND SIGNIFIED BY THIS RIDDLE WHAT
254-12312-0017 SAID GARGANTUA THE PROGRESS AND CARRYING ON OF THE DIVINE TRUTH BY SAINT GODERAN SAID THE MONK THAT IS NOT MY EXPOSITION IT IS THE STYLE OF THE PROPHET MERLIN
254-12312-0018 MAKE UPON IT AS MANY GRAVE ALLEGORIES AND GLOSSES AS YOU WILL AND DOTE UPON IT YOU AND THE REST OF THE WORLD AS LONG AS YOU PLEASE FOR MY PART
254-12312-0019 IN DARK AND OBSCURE TERMS THE SUBORNERS OF MEN ARE THE MAKERS OF MATCHES WHICH ARE COMMONLY FRIENDS AFTER THE TWO CHASES ARE MADE HE THAT WAS IN THE UPPER END OF THE TENNIS COURT GOETH OUT
254-12312-0020 AND THE OTHER COMETH IN THEY BELIEVE THE FIRST THAT SAITH THE BALL WAS OVER OR UNDER THE LINE THE WATERS ARE THE HEATS THAT THE PLAYERS TAKE TILL THEY SWEAT AGAIN THE CORDS OF THE RACKETS ARE MADE OF THE GUTS OF SHEEP OR GOATS
254-12312-0021 THE GLOBE TERRESTRIAL IS THE TENNIS BALL AFTER PLAYING WHEN THE GAME IS DONE THEY REFRESH THEMSELVES BEFORE A CLEAR FIRE AND CHANGE THEIR SHIRTS AND VERY WILLINGLY THEY MAKE ALL GOOD CHEER
254-127705-0000 THE YOSEMITE OR GRIZZLY BEAR TRIBE FANCYING THEMSELVES SECURE IN THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN STRONGHOLD WERE THE MOST TROUBLESOME AND DEFIANT OF ALL AND IT WAS WHILE THE MARIPOSA BATTALION UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR SAVAGE
254-127705-0001 WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THIS WARLIKE TRIBE AND CONDUCT THEM TO THE FRESNO RESERVATION THAT THEIR DEEP MOUNTAIN HOME THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS DISCOVERED
254-127705-0002 INSTRUCTING THEM TO TELL THE INDIANS THAT IF THEY WOULD COME IN AND MAKE TREATY WITH THE COMMISSIONERS THEY WOULD BE FURNISHED WITH FOOD AND CLOTHING AND BE PROTECTED BUT IF THEY DID NOT COME IN HE WOULD MAKE WAR UPON THEM AND KILL THEM ALL
254-127705-0003 INFORMED HIM OF THE WISHES OF THE COMMISSIONERS BUT THE OLD CHIEF WAS VERY SUSPICIOUS OF SAVAGE AND FEARED THAT HE WAS TAKING THIS METHOD OF GETTING THE TRIBE INTO HIS POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVENGING HIS PERSONAL WRONG
254-127705-0004 TENAYA INQUIRED WHAT WAS THE OBJECT OF TAKING ALL THE INDIANS TO THE SAN JOAQUIN PLAIN MY PEOPLE
254-127705-0005 MY YOUNG MEN HAVE SOMETIMES TAKEN HORSES AND MULES FROM THE WHITES
254-127705-0006 MY YOUNG MEN BELIEVED THAT THE GOLD DIGGERS WERE OUR ENEMIES
254-127705-0007 AND WE SHALL BE GLAD TO LIVE IN PEACE WITH THEM WE WILL STAY HERE AND BE FRIENDS MY PEOPLE DO NOT WANT TO GO TO THE PLAINS SOME OF THE TRIBES WHO HAVE GONE THERE ARE VERY BAD WE CANNOT LIVE WITH THEM HERE WE CAN DEFEND OURSELVES
254-127705-0008 TO THE MAJOR SAVAGE FIRMLY SAID YOUR PEOPLE MUST GO TO THE COMMISSIONERS IF THEY DO NOT YOUR YOUNG MEN WILL AGAIN STEAL HORSES AND KILL AND PLUNDER THE WHITES
254-127705-0009 IT WAS YOUR PEOPLE WHO ROBBED MY STORES BURNED MY HOUSES AND MURDERED MY MEN IT THEY DO NOT MAKE A TREATY YOUR WHOLE TRIBE WILL BE DESTROYED NOT ONE OF THEM WILL BE LEFT ALIVE TO THIS THE OLD CHIEF REPLIED
254-127705-0010 IT IS USELESS TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHO DESTROYED YOUR PROPERTY AND KILLED YOUR PEOPLE I AM OLD AND YOU CAN KILL ME IF YOU WILL BUT IT IS USELESS TO LIE TO YOU WHO KNOW MORE THAN ALL THE INDIANS
254-127705-0011 THEREFORE I WILL NOT LIE TO YOU BUT IF YOU WILL LET ME RETURN TO MY PEOPLE I WILL BRING THEM IN HE WAS ALLOWED TO GO THE NEXT DAY HE CAME BACK
254-127705-0012 AND SAID HIS PEOPLE WERE ON THE WAY TO OUR CAMP TO GO WITH THE MEN SENT BY THE GREAT FATHER WHO WAS SO GOOD AND RICH ANOTHER DAY PASSED BUT NO INDIANS FROM THE DEEP VALLEY APPEARED
254-127705-0013 AFTER WAITING STILL ANOTHER DAY THE EXPEDITION STARTED FOR THE VALLEY WHEN TENAYA WAS QUESTIONED AS TO THE ROUTE AND DISTANCE HE SAID THAT THE SNOW WAS SO DEEP THAT THE HORSES COULD NOT GO THROUGH IT
254-127705-0014 SAVAGE TOLD TENAYA THAT HE WAS NOT TELLING THE TRUTH FOR INDIANS COULD NOT CROSS THE MOUNTAINS IN THE DEEP SNOW AND THAT HE KNEW THEY MUST STILL BE AT HIS VILLAGE OR HIDING SOMEWHERE NEAR IT
254-127705-0015 TO SEE YOUR PEOPLE WHO WILL NOT COME THEY WILL COME IF I FIND THEM YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY OF MY PEOPLE THERE SAID TENAYA I DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY ARE MY TRIBE IS SMALL
254-127705-0016 MANY OF THE PEOPLE OF MY TRIBE HAVE COME FROM OTHER TRIBES AND IF THEY GO TO THE PLAINS AND ARE SEEN THEY WILL BE KILLED BY THE FRIENDS OF THOSE WITH WHOM THEY HAVE QUARRELED I WAS TOLD THAT I WAS GROWING OLD AND IT WAS WELL THAT I SHOULD GO
254-127705-0017 BUT THAT YOUNG AND STRONG MEN CAN FIND PLENTY IN THE MOUNTAINS THEREFORE WHY SHOULD THEY GO TO THE HOT PLAINS TO BE PENNED UP LIKE HORSES AND CATTLE MY HEART HAS BEEN SORE SINCE THAT TALK
254-127705-0018 BUT I AM NOW WILLING TO GO FOR IT IS BEST FOR MY PEOPLE PUSHING AHEAD TAKING TURNS IN BREAKING A WAY THROUGH THE SNOW THEY ARRIVED IN SIGHT OF THE GREAT VALLEY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON
254-127705-0019 AND GUIDED BY ONE OF TENAYA'S INDIANS DESCENDED BY THE SAME ROUTE AS THAT FOLLOWED BY THE MARIPOSA TRAIL AND THE WEARY PARTY WENT INTO CAMP ON THE RIVER BANK OPPOSITE EL CAPITAN AFTER SUPPER SEATED AROUND A BIG FIRE
254-127705-0020 POHONO THE BRIDAL VEIL BEING THE PRINCIPAL ONE THE EXPEDITION REMAINED ONLY ONE DAY AND TWO NIGHTS IN THE VALLEY HURRYING OUT ON THE APPROACH OF A STORM AND REACHED THE SOUTH FORK HEADQUARTERS
254-127705-0021 ON THE EVENING OF THE THIRD DAY AFTER STARTING OUT
254-127705-0022 MOST OF IT HAD BEEN EXPLORED IN A GENERAL WAY AND SOME OF ITS PRINCIPAL FEATURES HAD BEEN NAMED BUT THE INDIANS HAD FLED UP THE TENAYA CANYON TRAIL AND NONE OF THEM WERE SEEN EXCEPT AN OLD WOMAN UNABLE TO FOLLOW THE FUGITIVES
254-127705-0023 A SECOND EXPEDITION WAS MADE IN THE SAME YEAR UNDER COMMAND OF MAJOR BOLING WHEN THE VALLEY WAS ENTERED NO INDIANS WERE SEEN BUT THE MANY WIGWAMS WITH SMOLDERING FIRES
254-127705-0024 SHOWED THAT THEY HAD BEEN HURRIEDLY ABANDONED THAT VERY DAY LATER FIVE YOUNG INDIANS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT TO WATCH THE MOVEMENTS OF THE EXPEDITION WERE CAPTURED AT THE FOOT OF THE THREE BROTHERS AFTER A LIVELY CHASE
254-127705-0025 THAT SAME DAY THE OLD CHIEF WAS CAPTURED ON THE CLIFF ON THE EAST SIDE OF INDIAN CANYON BY SOME OF BOLING'S SCOUTS AS TENAYA WALKED TOWARD THE CAMP HIS EYE FELL UPON THE DEAD BODY OF HIS FAVORITE SON CAPTAIN BOLING
254-127705-0026 THROUGH AN INTERPRETER EXPRESSED HIS REGRET AT THE OCCURRENCE BUT NOT A WORD DID TENAYA UTTER IN REPLY LATER
254-127705-0027 BUT WAS CAUGHT AS HE WAS ABOUT TO SWIM ACROSS THE RIVER
254-127705-0028 AND WHEN BROUGHT INTO THE PRESENCE OF CAPTAIN BOLING HE SAID IN GREAT EMOTION KILL ME SIR CAPTAIN YES KILL ME AS YOU KILLED MY SON AS YOU WOULD KILL MY PEOPLE IF THEY WERE TO COME TO YOU
254-127705-0029 BUT WAIT A LITTLE AND WHEN I AM DEAD I WILL CALL MY PEOPLE TO COME AND THEY SHALL HEAR ME IN THEIR SLEEP AND COME TO AVENGE THE DEATH OF THEIR CHIEF AND HIS SON YES SIR AMERICA MY SPIRIT WILL MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOU AND YOUR PEOPLE
254-127705-0030 THIS LED TO ANOTHER YOSEMITE EXPEDITION A DETACHMENT OF REGULAR SOLDIERS FROM FORT MILLER UNDER LIEUTENANT MOORE U S A WAS AT ONCE DISPATCHED TO CAPTURE OR PUNISH THE MURDERERS
254-127705-0031 WHEN THE CAPTIVES WERE ACCUSED OF THE MURDER OF THE TWO WHITE MEN THEY ADMITTED THAT THEY HAD KILLED THEM TO PREVENT WHITE MEN FROM COMING TO THEIR VALLEY DECLARING THAT IT WAS THEIR HOME AND THAT WHITE MEN HAD NO RIGHT TO COME THERE WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT
254-127705-0032 TO THIS THEY REPLIED THAT TENAYA HAD NEVER CONSENTED TO THE SALE OF THEIR VALLEY AND HAD NEVER RECEIVED PAY FOR IT THE OTHER CHIEF THEY SAID HAD NO RIGHT TO SELL THEIR TERRITORY
254-127705-0033 THE LIEUTENANT BEING FULLY SATISFIED THAT HE HAD CAPTURED THE REAL MURDERERS PROMPTLY PRONOUNCED JUDGMENT AND HAD THEM PLACED IN LINE AND SHOT LIEUTENANT MOORE PURSUED THE FUGITIVES TO MONO BUT WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING ANY OF THEM
254-127705-0034 THEY STOLE A NUMBER OF STOLEN HORSES FROM THEIR ENTERTAINERS AND MADE THEIR WAY BY A LONG OBSCURE ROUTE BY THE HEAD OF THE NORTH FORK OF THE SAN JOAQUIN
254-127705-0035 BUT EARLY ONE MORNING AFTER A FEAST OF HORSE FLESH A BAND OF MONOS SURPRISED THEM IN THEIR HUTS KILLING TENAYA AND NEARLY ALL HIS TRIBE ONLY A SMALL REMNANT ESCAPED DOWN THE RIVER CANYON
254-127705-0036 WHEN MISTER J M HUTCHINGS HAVING HEARD OF ITS WONDERFUL SCENERY COLLECTED A PARTY AND MADE THE FIRST REGULAR TOURIST'S VISIT TO THE YOSEMITE
254-127705-0037 DESCRIBED IT IN ARTICLES ILLUSTRATED BY A GOOD ARTIST WHO WAS TAKEN INTO THE VALLEY BY HIM FOR THAT PURPOSE
254-127705-0038 CONSISTING OF SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN PERSONS THE NEXT YEAR THE REGULAR PLEASURE TRAVEL BEGAN AND A TRAIL ON THE MARIPOSA SIDE OF THE VALLEY WAS OPENED BY MANN BROTHERS THIS TRAIL WAS AFTERWARDS PURCHASED BY THE CITIZENS OF THE COUNTY
254-127705-0039 THE FIRST HOUSE BUILT IN THE YOSEMITE VALLEY WAS ERECTED IN THE AUTUMN OF EIGHTEEN FIFTY SIX AND WAS KEPT AS A HOTEL THE NEXT YEAR BY G A HITE AND LATER BY J H NEAL AND S M CUNNINGHAM
254-127705-0040 BY MISTER HUTCHINGS ALL THESE HOTELS HAVE VANISHED EXCEPT THE FRAME HOUSE BUILT IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED BEYOND RECOGNITION A LARGE HOTEL BUILT ON THE BRINK OF THE RIVER IN FRONT OF THE OLD ONE
254-127705-0041 AFTER THE ESTABLISHMENT BY ACT OF CONGRESS IN EIGHTEEN NINETY OF THE YOSEMITE NATIONAL PARK AND THE RECESSION IN NINETEEN O FIVE OF THE ORIGINAL RESERVATION TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BY THE STATE
254-127705-0042 TO THE BORDER OF THE PARK EIGHT MILES BELOW THE VALLEY IT IS EIGHTY MILES LONG
254-145458-0000 IS GUARDED JEALOUSLY FROM ALL BUT A FEW INTIMATES THE SECRET TO TAKE A CONTRARY CASE OF OUR INFALLIBLE REMEDY FOR SEASICKNESS IS THRUST UPON EVERY TRAVELLER WE MEET
254-145458-0001 INSISTING THAT SHE SHALL SHARE OUR DELIGHT IN THEM AND THERE ARE BOOKS EQUALLY DEAR TO US OF WHICH WE SAY NOTHING FEARING LEST THE PRAISE OF OTHERS
254-145458-0002 ALMOST AS SOON AS HE WAS DISCOVERABLE LET US SPARE A MOMENT AND A TEAR FOR THOSE GOLDEN DAYS IN THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHEN THERE WERE FIVE LEISURELY PAPERS OF AN EVENING
254-145458-0003 IN WHICH THE FREE LANCE MIGHT GRADUATE AND HE COULD SPEAK OF HIS ALMA MATER WHETHER THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WITH AS MUCH PRIDE AS HE NEVER DOUBTED THE GLOBE OR THE PALL MALL WOULD SPEAK ONE DAY OF HIM
254-145458-0004 MYSELF BUT LATELY DOWN FROM SAINT JAMES I WAS NOT TOO PROUD TO TAKE SOME SLIGHT BUT PITYING INTEREST IN MEN OF OTHER COLLEGES THE UNUSUAL NAME OF A FRESHMAN UP AT WESTMINSTER ATTRACTED MY ATTENTION
254-145458-0005 LATER ONE HEARD THAT THIS UNDERGRADUATE FROM OVERSEAS HAD GONE UP AT AN AGE MORE ADVANCED THAN CUSTOMARY
254-145458-0006 SO ONE FELT THAT THIS WESTMINSTER FREE LANCE IN THE THIRTIES WAS NO FIT COMPETITOR FOR THE YOUTH OF OTHER COLLEGES INDEED IT COULD NOT COMPETE WELL I DISCOVERED HIM
254-145458-0007 WHICH MADE ME THUS UNGENEROUS OF HIS NAME OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE FEELING THAT THE OTHERS WERE NOT WORTHY OF HIM BUT HOW REFRESHING IT WAS WHEN SOME INTELLECTUALLY BLOWN UP STRANGER SAID DO YOU EVER READ SAKI
254-145458-0008 TO US MANY OTHERS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT TOO FOR WE WERE SO DOMESTIC HE SO TERRIFYINGLY COSMOPOLITAN WHILE WE WERE BEING FUNNY AS PLANNED WITH COLLAR STUDS AND HOT WATER BOTTLES
254-145458-0009 IF SAKI'S CARELESS CRUELTY THAT STRANGE BOYISH INSENSITIVENESS OF HIS DID NOT GIVE HIM AN UNFAIR START IN THE PURSUIT OF LAUGHTER IT MAY HAVE BEEN SO BUT FORTUNATELY
254-145458-0010 OUR EFFORTS TO BE FUNNY IN THE SAKI MANNER HAVE NOT SURVIVED TO PROVE IT WHAT IS SAKI'S MANNER
254-145458-0011 LIKE EVERY ARTIST WORTH CONSIDERATION HE HAD NO RECIPE IF HIS EXOTIC CHOICE OF SUBJECT WAS OFTEN HIS STRENGTH IT WAS OFTEN HIS WEAKNESS
254-145458-0012 IF HIS INSENSITIVENESS CARRIED HIM THROUGH AT TIMES TO VICTORY IT BROUGHT HIM AT TIMES TO DEFEAT I DO NOT THINK THAT HE HAS THAT MASTERY OF THE CONTE IN THIS BOOK AT LEAST
254-145458-0013 WHICH SOME HAVE CLAIMED FOR HIM
254-145458-0014 WHICH WAS NOT IN THE BOYISH SAKI'S EQUIPMENT HE LEAVES LOOSE ENDS EVERYWHERE NOR IN HIS DIALOGUE DELIGHTFUL AS IT OFTEN IS FUNNY AS IT NEARLY ALWAYS IS IS HE THE SUPREME MASTER
254-145458-0015 TOO MUCH DOES IT BECOME MONOLOGUE JUDICIOUSLY FED ONE CHARACTER GIVING AND THE OTHER TAKING BUT IN COMMENT IN REFERENCE IN DESCRIPTION IN EVERY DEVELOPMENT OF HIS STORY
254-145458-0016 HE HAS A CHOICE OF WORDS A WAY OF PUTTING THINGS WHICH IS AS INEVITABLY HIS OWN VINTAGE AS ONCE TASTED IT BECOMES THE PRIVATE VINTAGE OF THE CONNOISSEUR
254-145458-0017 LET US TAKE A SAMPLE OR TWO OF SAKI NINETEEN ELEVEN THE EARLIER STAGES OF THE DINNER HAD WORN OFF THE WINE LISTS HAD BEEN CONSULTED
254-145458-0018 LOCATE IS THE PLEASANT WORD HERE STILL MORE SATISFYING IN THE STORY OF THE MAN WHO WAS TATTOOED FROM COLLAR BONE TO WAIST LINE WITH A GLOWING REPRESENTATION OF THE FALL OF ICARUS
254-145458-0019 IS THE WORD PRIVILEGE THE DESIGN WHEN FINALLY DEVELOPED WAS A SLIGHT DISAPPOINTMENT TO MONSIEUR DEPLIS WHO HAD SUSPECTED ICARUS OF BEING A FORTRESS
254-145458-0020 BUT HE WAS MORE THAN SATISFIED WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE WORK WHICH WAS ACCLAIMED BY ALL WHO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SEEING IT AS PINCINI'S MASTERPIECE THIS STORY THE BACKGROUND
254-145458-0021 AND MISSUS PACKLETIDE'S TIGER SEEM TO ME TO BE THE MASTERPIECES OF THIS BOOK IN BOTH OF THEM CLOVIS EXERCISES NEEDLESSLY HIS TITULAR RIGHT OF ENTRY BUT HE CAN BE REMOVED WITHOUT DAMAGE
254-27760-0000 WHO HAD BEEN APPRENTICE TO THE SHOEMAKER ALIAKHIN FOR THREE MONTHS DID NOT GO TO BED THE NIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS
254-27760-0001 HAD GONE OUT TO AN EARLY CHURCH SERVICE TO PROCURE FROM HIS EMPLOYER'S CUPBOARD
254-27760-0002 THEN SPREADING A CRUMPLED SHEET OF PAPER IN FRONT OF HIM HE BEGAN TO WRITE BEFORE HOWEVER DECIDING TO MAKE THE FIRST LETTER HE LOOKED FURTIVELY AT THE DOOR AND AT THE WINDOW GLANCED SEVERAL TIMES AT THE SOMBRE IKON
254-27760-0003 HE WROTE I AM WRITING YOU A LETTER
254-27760-0004 AND VIVIDLY PICTURED TO HIMSELF HIS GRANDFATHER
254-27760-0005 ALWAYS SMILING AND BLEAR EYED ALL DAY HE SLEPT IN THE SERVANTS KITCHEN OR TRIFLED WITH THE COOKS
254-27760-0006 HOW TO SNEAK UP AND TAKE A BITE AT A LEG OR SLIP INTO THE LARDER
254-27760-0007 MORE THAN ONCE THEY HAD NEARLY BROKEN HIS HIND LEGS TWICE HE HAD BEEN HUNG UP EVERY WEEK HE WAS NEARLY FLOGGED TO DEATH BUT HE ALWAYS RECOVERED AT THIS MOMENT FOR CERTAIN
254-27760-0008 HIS CUDGEL WILL BE HANGING FROM HIS BELT HE WILL BE HUGGING HIMSELF WITH COLD GIVING A LITTLE DRY OLD MAN'S COUGH AND AT TIMES PINCHING A SERVANT GIRL OR A COOK WON'T WE TAKE SOME SNUFF
254-27760-0009 HE ASKS HOLDING OUT HIS SNUFF BOX TO THE WOMEN THE WOMEN TAKE A PINCH OF SNUFF AND SNEEZE THE OLD MAN GOES INTO INDESCRIBABLE ECSTASIES BREAKS INTO LOUD LAUGHTER AND CRIES
254-27760-0010 NOT A BREATH OF WIND CLEAR AND FROSTY
254-27760-0011 THAT IT LOOKS AS IF IT HAD BEEN POLISHED AND RUBBED OVER WITH SNOW FOR THE HOLIDAYS VANKA SIGHS DIPS HIS PEN IN THE INK AND CONTINUES TO WRITE LAST NIGHT I GOT A THRASHING
254-27760-0012 MY MASTER DRAGGED ME BY MY HAIR INTO THE YARD AND BELABOURED ME WITH A SHOE MAKER'S STIRRUP BECAUSE
254-27760-0013 I UNFORTUNATELY FELL ASLEEP AND DURING THE WEEK MY MISTRESS TOLD ME TO CLEAN A HERRING

254-27760-0017 HOME TO OUR VILLAGE I CAN'T BEAR THIS ANY MORE I BOW TO THE GROUND TO YOU AND WILL PRAY TO GOD FOR EVER AND EVER TAKE ME FROM HERE OR I SHALL DIE
254-27760-0018 THE CORNERS OF VANKA'S MOUTH WENT DOWN HE RUBBED HIS EYES WITH HIS DIRTY FIST AND SOBBED I'LL GRATE YOUR TOBACCO FOR YOU HE CONTINUED I'LL PRAY TO GOD FOR YOU
254-27760-0019 AND IF THERE IS ANYTHING WRONG THEN FLOG ME LIKE THE GREY GOAT AND IF YOU REALLY THINK I SHAN'T FIND WORK

254-27760-0021 BUT I HAVE NO BOOTS AND I WAS AFRAID OF THE FROST AND WHEN I GROW UP I'LL LOOK AFTER YOU
254-27760-0022 THE CHILDREN DON'T COME ROUND AT CHRISTMAS WITH A STAR NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO SING IN THE CHOIR
254-27760-0023 ALL FOR SALE AND FOR EVERY KIND OF FISH AWFULLY CONVENIENT AND THERE WAS ONE HOOK WHICH WOULD CATCH A SHEAT FISH WEIGHING A POUND AND THERE ARE SHOPS WITH GUNS LIKE THE MASTER'S AND I AM SURE THEY MUST COST ONE HUNDRED RUBLES EACH
254-27760-0024 TAKE A GOLDEN WALNUT AND HIDE IT IN MY GREEN BOX ASK THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA FOR IT SAY IT'S FOR VANKA VANKA SIGHED CONVULSIVELY AND AGAIN STARED AT THE WINDOW
254-27760-0025 HE REMEMBERED THAT HIS GRANDFATHER ALWAYS WENT TO THE FOREST FOR THE CHRISTMAS TREE AND TOOK HIS GRANDSON WITH HIM WHAT HAPPY TIMES THE FROST CRACKLED HIS GRANDFATHER CRACKLED AND AS THEY BOTH DID
254-27760-0026 VANKA DID THE SAME THEN BEFORE CUTTING DOWN THE CHRISTMAS TREE HIS GRANDFATHER SMOKED HIS PIPE TOOK A LONG PINCH OF SNUFF AND MADE FUN OF POOR FROZEN LITTLE VANKA
254-27760-0027 THE YOUNG FIR TREES WRAPT IN HOAR FROST STOOD MOTIONLESS WAITING FOR WHICH OF THEM WOULD DIE SUDDENLY A HARE SPRINGING FROM SOMEWHERE WOULD DART OVER THE SNOWDRIFT HIS GRANDFATHER COULD NOT HELP SHOUTING CATCH IT CATCH IT
254-27760-0028 SHORT TAILED DEVIL WHEN THE TREE WAS DOWN HIS GRANDFATHER DRAGGED IT TO THE MASTER'S HOUSE AND THERE THEY SET ABOUT DECORATING IT THE YOUNG LADY OLGA IGNATYEVNA VANKA'S GREAT FRIEND
254-27760-0029 BUSIED HERSELF MOST ABOUT IT WHEN LITTLE VANKA'S MOTHER PELAGUEYA WAS STILL ALIVE AND WAS SERVANT WOMAN IN THE HOUSE OLGA IGNATYEVNA USED TO STUFF HIM WITH SUGAR CANDY AND HAVING NOTHING TO DO
254-27760-0030 TAUGHT HIM TO READ WRITE COUNT UP TO ONE HUNDRED AND EVEN TO DANCE THE QUADRILLE WHEN PELAGUEYA DIED THEY PLACED THE ORPHAN VANKA IN THE KITCHEN WITH HIS GRANDFATHER AND FROM THE KITCHEN HE WAS SENT TO MOSCOW
254-27760-0031 AND I AM FRIGHTFULLY HUNGRY AND SO SAD THAT I CAN'T TELL YOU I CRY ALL THE TIME THE OTHER DAY THE MASTER HIT ME ON THE HEAD WITH A LAST I FELL TO THE GROUND AND ONLY JUST RETURNED TO LIFE

254-27760-0033 FROM WHOM HE HAD INQUIRED THE NIGHT BEFORE HAD TOLD HIM THAT LETTERS WERE TO BE PUT INTO POST BOXES AND FROM THERE THEY WERE CONVEYED OVER THE WHOLE EARTH IN MAIL TROIKAS BY DRUNKEN POST BOYS
254-27760-0034 AND TO THE SOUND OF BELLS VANKA RAN TO THE FIRST POST BOX AND SLIPPED HIS PRECIOUS LETTER INTO THE SLIT AN HOUR AFTERWARDS LULLED BY HOPE HE WAS SLEEPING SOUNDLY
26-495-0000 IN SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE WRITTEN BY A CITIZEN WHO CONTINUED ALL THE WHILE IN LONDON NEVER MADE PUBLIC BEFORE
26-495-0001 IT WAS ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF SEPTEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT I AMONG THE REST OF MY NEIGHBOURS HEARD IN ORDINARY DISCOURSE THAT THE PLAGUE WAS RETURNED AGAIN IN HOLLAND
26-495-0002 IT WAS BROUGHT SOME SAID FROM ITALY OTHERS FROM THE LEVANT AMONG SOME GOODS WHICH WERE BROUGHT HOME BY THEIR TURKEY FLEET OTHERS SAID IT WAS BROUGHT FROM CANDIA OTHERS FROM CYPRUS
26-495-0003 SPREAD RUMOURS AND REPORTS OF THINGS AND TO IMPROVE THEM BY THE INVENTION OF MEN AS I HAVE LIVED TO SEE PRACTISED SINCE
26-495-0004 AND FROM THEM WAS HANDED ABOUT BY WORD OF MOUTH ONLY SO THAT THINGS DID NOT SPREAD INSTANTLY OVER THE WHOLE NATION AS THEY DO NOW BUT IT SEEMS THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAD A TRUE ACCOUNT OF IT
26-495-0005 AND SEVERAL COUNCILS WERE HELD ABOUT WAYS TO PREVENT ITS COMING OVER BUT ALL WAS KEPT VERY PRIVATE HENCE IT WAS THAT THIS RUMOUR DIED OFF AGAIN AND PEOPLE BEGAN TO FORGET IT AS A THING WE WERE VERY LITTLE CONCERNED IN
26-495-0006 AND THAT WE HOPED WAS NOT TRUE TILL THE LATTER END OF NOVEMBER OR THE BEGINNING OF DECEMBER SIXTEEN SIXTY FOUR WHEN TWO MEN SAID TO BE FRENCHMEN DIED OF THE PLAGUE IN LONG ACRE
26-495-0007 OR RATHER AT THE UPPER END OF DRURY LANE
26-495-0008 ENDEAVOURED TO CONCEAL IT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT AS IT HAD GOTTEN SOME VENT IN THE DISCOURSE OF THE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE SECRETARIES OF STATE GOT KNOWLEDGE OF IT AND CONCERNING THEMSELVES TO INQUIRE ABOUT IT IN ORDER TO BE CERTAIN OF THE TRUTH
26-495-0009 TWO PHYSICIANS AND A SURGEON WERE ORDERED TO GO TO THE HOUSE AND MAKE INSPECTION THIS THEY DID AND FINDING EVIDENT TOKENS OF THE SICKNESS UPON BOTH THE BODIES THAT WERE DEAD
26-495-0010 AND IT WAS PRINTED IN THE WEEKLY BILL OF MORTALITY IN THE USUAL MANNER THUS PLAGUE TWO PARISHES INFECTED ONE
26-495-0011 BUT AFTER THAT I THINK IT WAS ABOUT THE TWELFTH OF FEBRUARY ANOTHER DIED IN ANOTHER HOUSE BUT IN THE SAME PARISH AND IN THE SAME MANNER THIS TURNED THE PEOPLE'S EYES PRETTY MUCH TOWARDS THAT END OF THE TOWN
26-495-0012 IT BEGAN TO BE SUSPECTED THAT THE PLAGUE WAS AMONG THE PEOPLE AT THAT END OF THE TOWN AND THAT MANY HAD DIED OF IT THOUGH THEY HAD TAKEN CARE TO KEEP IT AS MUCH FROM THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PUBLIC AS POSSIBLE
26-495-0013 THIS POSSESSED THE HEADS OF THE PEOPLE VERY MUCH AND FEW CARED TO GO THROUGH DRURY LANE OR THE OTHER STREETS SUSPECTED UNLESS THEY HAD EXTRAORDINARY BUSINESS THAT OBLIGED THEM TO IT
26-495-0014 THE USUAL NUMBER OF BURIALS IN A WEEK IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT GILES IN THE FIELDS AND SAINT ANDREW'S HOLBORN WERE FROM TWELVE TO SEVENTEEN OR NINETEEN EACH FEW MORE OR LESS
26-495-0015 IT WAS OBSERVED THAT THE ORDINARY BURIALS INCREASED IN NUMBER CONSIDERABLY FOR EXAMPLE FROM DECEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH TO JANUARY THIRD
26-495-0016 THE LIKE INCREASE OF THE BILLS WAS OBSERVED IN THE PARISHES OF SAINT BRIDE'S ADJOINING ON ONE SIDE OF HOLBORN PARISH AND IN THE PARISH OF SAINT JAMES CLERKENWELL ADJOINING ON THE OTHER SIDE OF HOLBORN
26-495-0017 SAINT BRIDE'S ZERO SAINT JAMES'S EIGHT
26-495-0018 SAINT BRIDE'S SIX SAINT JAMES'S NINE
26-495-0019 SAINT JAMES'S SEVEN
26-495-0020 SAINT BRIDE'S EIGHT
26-495-0021 SAINT JAMES'S SIX BESIDES THIS IT WAS OBSERVED WITH GREAT UNEASINESS BY THE PEOPLE THAT THE WEEKLY BILLS IN GENERAL INCREASED VERY MUCH DURING THESE WEEKS ALTHOUGH IT WAS AT A TIME OF THE YEAR WHEN
26-495-0022 IN ONE WEEK SINCE THE PRECEDING VISITATION OF SIXTEEN FIFTY SIX HOWEVER ALL THIS WENT OFF AGAIN AND THE WEATHER PROVING COLD AND THE FROST WHICH BEGAN IN DECEMBER
26-495-0023 STILL CONTINUING VERY SEVERE EVEN TILL NEAR THE END OF FEBRUARY ATTENDED WITH SHARP THOUGH MODERATE WINDS THE BILLS DECREASED AGAIN AND THE CITY GREW HEALTHY AND EVERYBODY BEGAN TO LOOK UPON THE DANGER AS GOOD AS OVER
26-495-0024 FROM THE BEGINNING OF APRIL ESPECIALLY THEY STOOD AT TWENTY FIVE EACH WEEK TILL THE WEEK FROM THE EIGHTEENTH TO THE TWENTY FIFTH
26-495-0025 THERE WAS NONE OF THE PLAGUE AND BUT FOUR OF THE SPOTTED FEVER BUT THE FOLLOWING WEEK IT RETURNED AGAIN AND THE DISTEMPER WAS SPREAD INTO TWO OR THREE OTHER PARISHES
26-495-0026 NOT KNOWING THAT HE WAS ALREADY INFECTED THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF MAY YET THE WEATHER WAS TEMPERATE VARIABLE AND COOL ENOUGH AND PEOPLE HAD STILL SOME HOPES THAT WHICH ENCOURAGED THEM WAS THAT THE CITY WAS HEALTHY
26-495-0027 THERE DIED BUT THREE OF WHICH NOT ONE WITHIN THE WHOLE CITY OR LIBERTIES AND SAINT ANDREW'S BURIED BUT FIFTEEN WHICH WAS VERY LOW
26-495-0028 BUT STILL AS THERE WAS BUT ONE OF THE PLAGUE PEOPLE BEGAN TO BE EASY THE WHOLE BILL ALSO WAS VERY LOW FOR THE WEEK BEFORE THE BILL WAS BUT THREE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN
26-495-0029 SO THAT NOW ALL OUR EXTENUATIONS ABATED AND IT WAS NO MORE TO BE CONCEALED NAY IT QUICKLY APPEARED THAT THE INFECTION HAD SPREAD ITSELF BEYOND ALL HOPES OF ABATEMENT THAT IN THE PARISH OF SAINT GILES
26-495-0030 BUT THIS WAS ALL KNAVERY AND COLLUSION
26-495-0031 YET THERE WAS FOURTEEN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER AS WELL AS FOURTEEN OF THE PLAGUE
26-495-0032 UPON THE WHOLE THAT THERE WERE FIFTY DIED THAT WEEK OF THE PLAGUE THE NEXT BILL WAS FROM THE TWENTY THIRD OF MAY TO THE THIRTIETH WHEN THE NUMBER OF THE PLAGUE WAS SEVENTEEN BUT
26-495-0033 A FRIGHTFUL NUMBER OF WHOM THEY SET DOWN BUT NINE OF THE PLAGUE BUT ON AN EXAMINATION MORE STRICTLY BY THE JUSTICES OF PEACE AND AT THE LORD MAYOR'S REQUEST
26-495-0034 TWENTY MORE WHO WERE REALLY DEAD OF THE PLAGUE IN THAT PARISH BUT HAD BEEN SET DOWN OF THE SPOTTED FEVER OR OTHER DISTEMPERS BESIDES OTHERS CONCEALED
26-495-0035 OUR NEIGHBOURHOOD CONTINUED VERY EASY BUT AT THE OTHER END OF THE TOWN THEIR CONSTERNATION WAS VERY GREAT AND THE RICHER SORT OF PEOPLE ESPECIALLY THE NOBILITY AND GENTRY FROM THE WEST PART OF THE CITY
26-495-0036 IN AN UNUSUAL MANNER AND THIS WAS MORE PARTICULARLY SEEN IN WHITECHAPPEL THAT IS TO SAY THE BROAD STREET WHERE I LIVED INDEED NOTHING WAS TO BE SEEN BUT WAGGONS AND CARTS WITH GOODS
26-495-0037 COACHES FILLED WITH PEOPLE OF THE BETTER SORT AND HORSEMEN ATTENDING THEM AND ALL HURRYING AWAY THEN EMPTY WAGGONS AND CARTS APPEARED AND SPARE HORSES WITH SERVANTS WHO IT WAS APPARENT
26-495-0038 WERE RETURNING OR SENT FROM THE COUNTRIES TO FETCH MORE PEOPLE BESIDES INNUMERABLE NUMBERS OF MEN ON HORSEBACK SOME ALONE OTHERS WITH SERVANTS AND GENERALLY SPEAKING
26-495-0039 AS ANYONE MIGHT PERCEIVE BY THEIR APPEARANCE THIS WAS A VERY TERRIBLE AND MELANCHOLY THING TO SEE AND AS IT WAS A SIGHT WHICH I COULD NOT BUT LOOK ON FROM MORNING TO NIGHT
26-495-0040 THIS HURRY OF THE PEOPLE WAS SUCH FOR SOME WEEKS THAT THERE WAS NO GETTING AT THE LORD MAYOR'S DOOR WITHOUT EXCEEDING DIFFICULTY THERE WERE SUCH PRESSING AND CROWDING THERE
26-495-0041 TO GET PASSES AND CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH FOR SUCH AS TRAVELLED ABROAD FOR WITHOUT THESE THERE WAS NO BEING ADMITTED TO PASS THROUGH THE TOWNS UPON THE ROAD OR TO LODGE IN ANY INN
26-495-0042 NOW AS THERE HAD NONE DIED IN THE CITY FOR ALL THIS TIME MY LORD MAYOR GAVE CERTIFICATES OF HEALTH WITHOUT ANY DIFFICULTY TO ALL THOSE WHO LIVED IN THE NINETY SEVEN PARISHES AND TO THOSE WITHIN THE LIBERTIES TOO
26-495-0043 THIS HURRY I SAY CONTINUED SOME WEEKS THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE MONTH OF MAY AND JUNE AND THE MORE BECAUSE IT WAS RUMOURED THAT AN ORDER OF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO BE ISSUED OUT
26-495-0044 TO PLACE TURNPIKES AND BARRIERS ON THE ROAD TO PREVENT PEOPLE TRAVELLING AND THAT THE TOWNS ON THE ROAD WOULD NOT SUFFER PEOPLE FROM LONDON TO PASS FOR FEAR OF BRINGING THE INFECTION ALONG WITH THEM
26-495-0045 CONCERNING MY OWN CASE AND HOW I SHOULD DISPOSE OF MYSELF THAT IS TO SAY WHETHER I SHOULD RESOLVE TO STAY IN LONDON OR SHUT UP MY HOUSE AND FLEE AS MANY OF MY NEIGHBOURS DID I HAVE SET THIS PARTICULAR DOWN
